   Orotate reductase (NADH)      Orotate reductase (NADH)   In enzymology , an orotate reductase (NADH) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-dihydroorotate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   orotate + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-dihydroorotate and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are orotate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-dihydroorotate:NAD+ oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called orotate reductase (NADH) . This enzyme participates in pyrimidine metabolism . It has 2 cofactors : FAD , and FMN .  References       "  Category:EC 1.3.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Flavin enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
