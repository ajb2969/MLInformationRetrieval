   CDP-diacylglycerol—serine O-phosphatidyltransferase      CDP-diacylglycerol—serine O-phosphatidyltransferase   In enzymology , a CDP-diacylglycerol—serine O-phosphatidyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   CDP-diacylglycerol + L-serine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CMP + (3-sn-phosphatidyl)-L-serine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CDP-diacylglycerol and L-serine , whereas its two products are CMP and (3-sn-phosphatidyl)-L-serine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring non-standard substituted phosphate groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is CDP-diacylglycerol:L-serine 3-sn-phosphatidyltransferase . Other names in common use include phosphatidylserine synthase , CDPdiglyceride-serine O-phosphatidyltransferase , PS synthase , cytidine 5'-diphospho-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol , (CDPdiglyceride):L-serine O-phosphatidyltransferase , phosphatidylserine synthetase , CDP-diacylglycerol-L-serine O-phosphatidyltransferase , cytidine diphosphoglyceride-serine O-phosphatidyltransferase , CDP-diglyceride-L-serine phosphatidyltransferase , CDP-diglyceride:serine phosphatidyltransferase , cytidine 5'-diphospho-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol:L-serine , O-phosphatidyltransferase , and CDP-diacylglycerol:L-serine 3-O-phosphatidyltransferase . This enzyme participates in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism .  References      "  Category:EC 2.7.8  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
