Strong partition cardinal

In Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice a strong partition cardinal is an uncountable well-ordered cardinal

 
  such that every partition of the set 
 
 
 
 of size 
 
 
 
  subsets of 
 
 
 
  into less than 
 
 
 
  pieces has a  homogeneous set of size 
 
 
 
 .
The existence of strong partition cardinals contradicts the axiom of choice. The Axiom of determinacy implies that â„µ1 is a strong partition cardinal.
