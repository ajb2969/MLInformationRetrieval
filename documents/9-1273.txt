   Strong partition cardinal      Strong partition cardinal   In Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice a strong partition cardinal is an uncountable  well-ordered  cardinal    k   k   k   such that every partition of the set     [  k  ]   k     superscript   delimited-[]  k   k    [k]^{k}   of size   k   k   k   subsets of   k   k   k   into less than   k   k   k   pieces has a homogeneous set of size   k   k   k   .  The existence of strong partition cardinals contradicts the axiom of choice. The Axiom of determinacy implies that â„µ 1 is a strong partition cardinal.  References     .
