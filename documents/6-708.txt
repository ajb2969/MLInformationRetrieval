   Neural gas      Neural gas   Neural gas is an artificial neural network , inspired by the self-organizing map and introduced in 1991 by Thomas Martinetz and Klaus Schulten . 1 The neural gas is a simple algorithm for finding optimal data representations based on feature vectors . The algorithm was coined "neural gas" because of the dynamics of the feature vectors during the adaptation process, which distribute themselves like a gas within the data space. It is applied where data compression or vector quantization is an issue, for example speech recognition , 2  image processing 3 or pattern recognition . As a robustly converging alternative to the k-means clustering it is also used for cluster analysis . 4  Algorithm  Given a probability distribution  P(x) of data vectors x and a finite number of feature vectors  w i , i=1,...,N .  With each time step t a data vector randomly chosen from P is presented. Subsequently, the distance order of the feature vectors to the given data vector x is determined. i 0 denotes the index of the closest feature vector, i 1 the index of the second closest feature vector etc. and i N-1 the index of the feature vector most distant to x . Then each feature vector ( k=0,...,N-1 ) is adapted according to        w   i  k    t  +  1    =    w   i  k   t   +   ε  ⋅   e   -   k  /  λ     ⋅   (   x  -   w   i  k   t    )          superscript   subscript  w   subscript  i  k      t  1       superscript   subscript  w   subscript  i  k    t    normal-⋅  ε   superscript  e      k  λ       x   superscript   subscript  w   subscript  i  k    t        w_{i_{k}}^{t+1}=w_{i_{k}}^{t}+\varepsilon\cdot e^{-k/\lambda}\cdot(x-w_{i_{k}}%
 ^{t})      with ε as the adaptation step size and λ as the so-called neighborhood range. ε and λ are reduced with increasing t . After sufficiently many adaptation steps the feature vectors cover the data space with minimum representation error. 5  The adaptation step of the neural gas can be interpreted as gradient descent on a cost function . By adapting not only the closest feature vector but all of them with a step size decreasing with increasing distance order, compared to (online) k-means clustering a much more robust convergence of the algorithm can be achieved. The neural gas model does not delete a node and also does not create new nodes.  Further reading   T. Martinetz, S. Berkovich, and K. Schulten.
