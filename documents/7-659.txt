Direct product of groups




Direct product of groups

In group theory, the direct product is an operation that takes two groups

 
  and 
 
 
 
  and constructs a new group, usually denoted 
 
 
 
 . This operation is the group-theoretic analogue of the Cartesian product of sets and is one of several important notions of direct product in mathematics.
In the context of abelian groups, the direct product is sometimes referred to as the direct sum, and is denoted 
 
 
 
 . Direct sums play an important role in the classification of abelian groups: according to the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, every finite abelian group can be expressed as the direct sum of cyclic groups.
Definition
Given groups 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the direct product

 
  is defined as follows:

The elements of 
 
 
 
  are ordered pairs

 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . That is, the set of elements of 
 
 
 
  is the Cartesian product of the sets 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The binary operation on 
 
 
 
  is defined componentwise:
 
  (g1 · g2, h1 · h2)}}


The resulting algebraic object satisfies the axioms for a group. Specifically:

Associativity: The binary operation on 
 
 
 
  is indeed associative.
 Identity: The direct product has an identity element, namely , where  is the identity element of 
 
 
 
  and  is the identity element of 
 
 
 
 .
 Inverses: The inverse of an element 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is the pair , where  is the inverse of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , and  is the inverse of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .

Examples

Let 
 
 
 
  be the group of real numbers under addition. Then the direct product 
 
 
 
  is the group of all two-component vectors

 
  under the operation of vector addition:
 
  (x1 + x2, y1 + y2)}}.



Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be cyclic groups with two elements each:















*


























*



















Then the direct product 
 
 
 
  is isomorphic to the Klein four-group:
 

:::{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; width:250px; height:175px;" |+ 
 
 
 
  |- ! * !! 
 
 
 
  !! 
 
 
 
  !! 
 
 
 
  !! 
 
 
 
  |- ! 
 
 
 
  | 
 
 
 
  || 
 
 
 
  || 
 
 
 
  || 
 
 
 
  |- ! 
 
 
 
  | 
 
 
 
  || 
 
 
 
  || 
 
 
 
  || 
 
 
 
  |- ! 
 
 
 
  | 
 
 
 
  || 
 
 
 
  ||

  |- ! 
 
 
 
  | 
 
 
 
  || 
 
 
 
  || 
 
 
 
  || 
 
 
 
  |}
Elementary properties

The order of a direct product 
 
 
 
  is the product of the orders of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 :



|

|  =  |

| |

|.
 


This follows from the formula for the cardinality of the cartesian product of sets.
 


The order of each element 
 
 
 
  is the least common multiple of the orders of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 :1



|

|  =  

( |

|, |

| ).
 


In particular, if |

| and |

| are relatively prime, then the order of 
 
 
 
  is the product of the orders of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
 


As a consequence, if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are cyclic groups whose orders are relatively prime, then 
 
 
 
  is cyclic as well. That is, if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are relatively prime, then



.
 


This fact is closely related to the Chinese remainder theorem.
 

Algebraic structure
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be groups, let 
 
 
 
 , and consider the following two subsets of 
 
 
 
 :



   and    




Both of these are in fact subgroups of 
 
 
 
 , the first being isomorphic to 
 
 
 
 , and the second being isomorphic to 
 
 
 
 . If we identify these with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively, then we can think of the direct product 
 
 
 
  as containing the original groups 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  as subgroups.
These subgroups of 
 
 
 
  have the following three important properties: (Saying again that we identify 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively.)

The intersection

 
  is trivial.
Every element of 
 
 
 
  can be expressed as the product of an element of 
 
 
 
  and an element of 
 
 
 
 .
Every element of 
 
 
commutes with every element of 
 
 
 
 .

Together, these three properties completely determine the algebraic structure of the direct product 
 
 
 
 . That is, if 
 
 
 
  is any group having subgroups 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  that satisfy the properties above, then 
 
 
 
  is necessarily isomorphic to the direct product of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . In this situation, 
 
 
 
  is sometimes referred to as the internal direct product of its subgroups 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
In some contexts, the third property above is replaced by the following:

3′.  Both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are normal in 
 
 
 
 .
 

This property is equivalent to property 3, since the elements of two normal subgroups with trivial intersection necessarily commute, a fact which can be deduced by considering the commutator

 
  of any 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .
Examples

Let 
 
 
 
  be the Klein four-group:

::{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; width:150px; height:150px;" |+ 
 
 
 
  |- ! * !! 
 
 
 
  !! 
 
 
 
  !! 
 
 
 
  !! 
 
 
 
  |- ! 
 
 
 
  | 
 
 
 
  || 
 
 
 
  || 
 
 
 
  || 
 
 
 
  |- ! 
 
 
 
  | 
 
 
 
  || 
 
 
 
  || 
 
 
 
  || 
 
 
 
  |- ! 
 
 
 
  | 
 
 
 
  || 
 
 
 
  || 
 
 
 
  || 
 
 
 
  |- ! 
 
 
 
  | 
 
 
 
  || 
 
 
 
  || 
 
 
 
  || 
 
 
 
  |}

Then 
 
 
 
  is the internal direct product of the two-element subgroups  and 
 


Let 
 
 
 
  be a cyclic group of order 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are relatively prime. Then  and  are cyclic subgroups of orders 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively, and 
 
 
 
  is the internal direct product of these subgroups.


Let  be the group of nonzero complex numbers under multiplication. Then  is the internal direct product of the circle group

 
  of unit complex numbers and the group  of positive real numbers under multiplication.


If n is odd, then the general linear group

 
  is the internal direct product of the special linear group

 
  and the subgroup consisting of all scalar matrices.


Similarly, when n is odd the orthogonal group

 
  is the internal direct product of the special orthogonal group 
 
 
 
  and the two-element subgroup  where 
 
 
 
  denotes the identity matrix.


The symmetry group of a cube is the internal direct product of the subgroup of rotations and the two-element group  where 
 
 
 
  is the identity element and 
 
 
 
  is the point reflection through the center of the cube. A similar fact holds true for the symmetry group of an icosahedron.


Let 
 
 
 
  be odd, and let  be the dihedral group of order 
 
 
 
 :



 r2n = s2 = 1, sr = r−1s 〉}}.
 


Then  is the internal direct product of the subgroup  (which is isomorphic to ) and the two-element subgroup 
 

Presentations
The algebraic structure of 
 
 
 
  can be used to give a presentation for the direct product in terms of the presentations of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Specifically, suppose that

 RG 〉}}     and      RH 〉}},
 

where  and  are (disjoint) generating sets and  and  are defining relations. Then

 RG ∪ RH ∪ RP 〉}}


where  is a set of relations specifying that each element of  commutes with each element of 
For example, suppose that

 a3 = 1 〉}}     and      b5 = 1 〉}}.
 

Then

 a3 = 1, b5 = 1, ab = ba 〉}}.
 

Normal structure
As mentioned above, the subgroups 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are normal in 
 
 
 
 . Specifically, define functions  and  by

     and     .
 

Then  and  are homomorphisms, known as projection homomorphisms, whose kernels are 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively.
It follows that 
 
 
 
  is an extension of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  (or vice versa). In the case where 
 
 
 
  is a finite group, it follows that the composition factors of 
 
 
 
  are precisely the union of the composition factors of 
 
 
 
  and the composition factors of 
 
 
 
 .
Further properties
Universal property
The direct product 
 
 
 
  can be characterized by the following universal property. Let  and  be the projection homomorphisms. Then for any group 
 
 
 
  and any homomorphisms  and , there exists a unique homomorphism 
 
 
 
  making the following diagram commute:




Specifically, the homomorphism 
 
 
 
  is given by the formula

  ( ƒG(p), ƒH(p) )}}.
 

This is a special case of the universal property for products in category theory.
Subgroups
If 
 
 
 
  is a subgroup of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is a subgroup of 
 
 
 
 , then the direct product 
 
 
 
  is a subgroup of 
 
 
 
 . For example, the isomorphic copy of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  is the product 
 
 
{1}, where {1} is the trivial subgroup of 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are normal, then 
 
 
 
  is a normal subgroup of 
 
 
 
 . Moreover, the quotient

 
  is isomorphic to the direct product of the quotients 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 :



 
   ≅  
 
 
 
 .
 

Note that it is not true in general that every subgroup of 
 
 
 
  is the product of a subgroup of 
 
 
 
  with a subgroup of 
 
 
 
 . For example, if 
 
 
 
  is any group, then the product 
 
 
 
  has a diagonal subgroup



 
   =  { 
 
 
 
  }
 

which is not the direct product of two subgroups of 
 
 
 
 . Other subgroups include fiber products of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  (see below). The subgroups of direct products are described by Goursat's lemma.
Conjugacy and centralizers
Two elements  and  are conjugate in 
 
 
 
  if and only if  and  are conjugate in 
 
 
 
  and  and  are conjugate in 
 
 
 
 . It follows that each conjugacy class in 
 
 
 
  is simply the Cartesian product of a conjugacy class in 
 
 
 
  and a conjugacy class in 
 
 
 
 .
Along the same lines, if 
 
 
 
 , the centralizer of 
 
 
 
  is simply the product of the centralizers of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 :

  =  .
 

Similarly, the center of 
 
 
 
  is the product of the centers of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 :



 
   =  
 
 
 
 .
 

Normalizers behave in a more complex manner since not all subgroups of direct products themselves decompose as direct products.
Automorphisms and endomorphisms
If 
 
 
 
  is an automorphism of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is an automorphism of 
 
 
 
 , then the product function 
 
 
 
  defined by

 (α(g), β(h))}}


is an automorphism of 
 
 
 
 . It follows that 
 
 
 
  has a subgroup isomorphic to the direct product 
 
 
 
 .
It is not true in general that every automorphism of 
 
 
 
  has the above form. (That is, 
 
 
 
  is often a proper subgroup of 
 
 
 
 .) For example, if 
 
 
 
  is any group, then there exists an automorphism 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  that switches the two factors, i.e.

 (g2, g1)}}.
 

For another example, the automorphism group of 
 
 
 
  is 

, the group of all 
 
 
matrices with integer entries and determinant

 
 . This automorphism group is infinite, but only finitely many of the automorphisms have the form given above.
In general, every endomorphism of 
 
 
 
  can be written as a 
 
 
 
  matrix



where 
 
 
 
  is an endomorphism of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is an endomorphism of 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are homomorphisms. Such a matrix must have the property that every element in the image of 
 
 
 
  commutes with every element in the image of 
 
 
 
 , and every element in the image of 
 
 
 
  commutes with every element in the image of 
 
 
 
 .
When G and H are indecomposable, centerless groups, then the automorphism group is relatively straightforward, being Aut(G) × Aut(H) if G and H are not isomorphic, and Aut(G) wr 2 if G ≅ H, wr denotes the wreath product. This is part of the Krull–Schmidt theorem, and holds more generally for finite direct products.
Generalizations
Finite direct products
It is possible to take the direct product of more than two groups at once. Given a finite sequence  of groups, the direct product


 
  is defined as follows:

The elements of  are tuples , where  for each 
 
 
 
 .
The operation on  is defined componentwise:
 
  =  .


This has many of the same properties as the direct product of two groups, and can be characterized algebraically in a similar way.
Infinite direct products
It is also possible to take the direct product of an infinite number of groups. For an infinite sequence  of groups, this can be defined just like the finite direct product of above, with elements of the infinite direct product being infinite tuples.
More generally, given an indexed family {  } of groups, the direct product  is defined as follows:

The elements of  are the elements of the infinite Cartesian product of the sets , i.e. functions 
 
 
U with the property that  for each 
 
 
 
 .
The product of two elements 
 
 
 
  is defined componentwise:
 


 
   =  
 
 
 
 .


Unlike a finite direct product, the infinite direct product  is not generated by the elements of the isomorphic subgroups {  }. Instead, these subgroups generate a subgroup of the direct product known as the infinite direct sum, which consists of all elements that have only finitely many non-identity components.
Other products
Semidirect products
Recall that a group 
 
 
 
  with subgroups 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is isomorphic to the direct product of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  as long as it satisfies the following three conditions:

The intersection

 
  is trivial.
Every element of 
 
 
 
  can be expressed as the product of an element of 
 
 
 
  and an element of 
 
 
 
 .
Both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are normal in 
 
 
 
 .

A semidirect product of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is obtained by relaxing the third condition, so that only one of the two subgroups 
 
 
 
  is required to be normal. The resulting product still consists of ordered pairs 
 
 
 
 , but with a slightly more complicated rule for multiplication.
It is also possible to relax the third condition entirely, requiring neither of the two subgroups to be normal. In this case, the group 
 
 
 
  is referred to as a Zappa–Szép product of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Free products
The free product of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , usually denoted 
 
 
 
 , is similar to the direct product, except that the subgroups 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  are not required to commute. That is, if



 
  = |     and     
 
 
 
  = |,
 

are presentations for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then



 
  = |.
 

Unlike the direct product, elements of the free product cannot be represented by ordered pairs. In fact, the free product of any two nontrivial groups is infinite. The free product is actually the coproduct in the category of groups.
Subdirect products
If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are groups, a subdirect product of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is any subgroup of 
 
 
 
  which maps surjectively onto 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  under the projection homomorphisms. By Goursat's lemma, every subdirect product is a fiber product.
Fiber products
Let 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  be groups, and let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be homomorphisms. The fiber product of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
 , also known as a pullback, is the following subgroup of 
 
 
 
 :

  =  {

}.
 

If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are epimorphism, then this is a subdirect product.
