   Hypoxia-inducible factor-asparagine dioxygenase      Hypoxia-inducible factor-asparagine dioxygenase   Hypoxia-inducible factor-asparagine dioxygenase (, HIF hydroxylase ) is an enzyme with system name hypoxia-inducible factor-L-asparagine, 2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (4-hydroxylating) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   hypoxia-inducible factor -L- asparagine + 2-oxoglutarate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   hypoxia-inducible factor-(3S)-3-hydroxy-L-asparagine + succinate + CO 2    Hypoxia-inducible factor-asparagine dioxygenase contains iron , and requires ascorbate .
