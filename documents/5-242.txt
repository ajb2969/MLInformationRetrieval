   Correspondence theorem (group theory)      Correspondence theorem (group theory)  In the area of mathematics known as group theory , the correspondence theorem , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 sometimes referred to as the fourth isomorphism theorem 9 10 11 12 or the lattice theorem , 13 states that if   N   N   N   is a normal subgroup of a group    G   G   G   , then there exists a bijection from the set of all subgroups    A   A   A   of   G   G   G   containing   N   N   N   , onto the set of all subgroups of the quotient group     G  /  N      G  N    G/N   . The structure of the subgroups of    G  /  N      G  N    G/N   is exactly the same as the structure of the subgroups of   G   G   G   containing    N  ,    N   N,   with   N   N   N   collapsed to the identity element .  This establishes a monotone Galois connection between the lattice of subgroups of   G   G   G   and the lattice of subgroups of    G  /  N      G  N    G/N   , where the associated closure operator on subgroups of   G   G   G   is      H  ¯   =   H  N    .       normal-¯  H     H  N     \bar{H}=HN.     Specifically, if   G is a group,  N is a normal subgroup of G ,     𝒢   𝒢   \mathcal{G}   is the set of all subgroups A of G such that    N  ⊆  A  ⊆  G        N  A       G     N\subseteq A\subseteq G   , and     𝒩   𝒩   \mathcal{N}   is the set of all subgroups of G/N ,   then there is a bijective map    ϕ  :   𝒢  →  𝒩      normal-:  ϕ   normal-→  𝒢  𝒩     \phi:\mathcal{G}\to\mathcal{N}   such that       ϕ   (  A  )    =   A  /  N         ϕ  A     A  N     \phi(A)=A/N   for all     A  ∈  𝒢   .      A  𝒢    A\in\mathcal{G}.     One further has that if A and B are in   𝒢   𝒢   \mathcal{G}   , and A' = A/N and B' = B/N , then       A  ⊆  B      A  B    A\subseteq B   if and only if     A  ′   ⊆   B  ′        superscript  A  normal-′    superscript  B  normal-′     A^{\prime}\subseteq B^{\prime}   ;  if    A  ⊆  B      A  B    A\subseteq B   then    |  B  :  A  |  =  |   B  ′   :   A  ′   |     fragments  normal-|  B  normal-:  A  normal-|   normal-|   superscript  B  normal-′   normal-:   superscript  A  normal-′   normal-|    |B:A|=|B^{\prime}:A^{\prime}|   , where    |  B  :  A  |     fragments  normal-|  B  normal-:  A  normal-|    |B:A|   is the index of A in B (the number of cosets  bA of A in B );         ⟨  A  ,  B  ⟩   /  N   =   ⟨   A  ′   ,   B  ′   ⟩    ,         A  B   N     superscript  A  normal-′    superscript  B  normal-′      \langle A,B\rangle/N=\langle A^{\prime},B^{\prime}\rangle,   where    ⟨  A  ,  B  ⟩     A  B    \langle A,B\rangle   is the subgroup of   G   G   G    generated by     A  ∪  B   ;      A  B    A\cup B;           (   A  ∩  B   )   /  N   =    A  ′   ∩   B  ′            A  B   N      superscript  A  normal-′    superscript  B  normal-′      (A\cap B)/N=A^{\prime}\cap B^{\prime}   , and     A   A   A   is a normal subgroup of   G   G   G   if and only if    A  ′     superscript  A  normal-′    A^{\prime}   is a normal subgroup of    G  /  N      G  N    G/N   .   This list is far from exhaustive. In fact, most properties of subgroups are preserved in their images under the bijection onto subgroups of a quotient group.
