Correspondence theorem (group theory)
In the area of mathematics known as group theory, the correspondence theorem,12345678 sometimes referred to as the fourth isomorphism theorem9101112 or the lattice theorem,13 states that if 
 
 
 
  is a normal subgroup of a group

 
 , then there exists a bijection from the set of all subgroups

 
  of 
 
 
 
  containing 
 
 
 
 , onto the set of all subgroups of the quotient group

 
 . The structure of the subgroups of 
 
 
 
  is exactly the same as the structure of the subgroups of 
 
 
 
  containing 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  collapsed to the identity element.
This establishes a monotone Galois connection between the lattice of subgroups of 
 
 
 
  and the lattice of subgroups of 
 
 
 
 , where the associated closure operator on subgroups of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 

Specifically, if

G is a group,
 
N is a normal subgroup of G,
 


 
  is the set of all subgroups A of G such that 
 
 
 
 , and
 


 
  is the set of all subgroups of G/N,
 

then there is a bijective map 
 
 
 
  such that


 
  for all 
 
 

One further has that if A and B are in 
 
 
 
 , and A' = A/N and B' = B/N, then



 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 ;
if 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the index of A in B (the number of cosets bA of A in B);


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the subgroup of 
 
 
generated by 
 
 



 
 , and


 
  is a normal subgroup of 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a normal subgroup of 
 
 
 
 .

This list is far from exhaustive. In fact, most properties of subgroups are preserved in their images under the bijection onto subgroups of a quotient group.
Similar results hold for rings, modules, vector spaces, and algebras.
