Glutamine—tRNA ligase




Glutamine—tRNA ligase

In enzymology, a glutamine-tRNA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + L-glutamine + tRNAGln 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + L-glutaminyl-tRNAGln
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, L-glutamine, and tRNA(Gln), whereas its 3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and L-glutaminyl-tRNA(Gln).
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, to be specific those forming carbon-oxygen bonds in aminoacyl-tRNA and related compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-glutamine:tRNAGln ligase (AMP-forming). Other names in common use include glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase, glutaminyl-transfer RNA synthetase, glutaminyl-transfer ribonucleate synthetase, glutamine-tRNA synthetase, glutamine translase, glutamate-tRNA ligase, glutaminyl ribonucleic acid, and GlnRS. This enzyme participates in glutamate metabolism and aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis.
