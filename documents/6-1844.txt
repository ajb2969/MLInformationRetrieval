   HR 8832      HR 8832   HR 8832 (or HD 219134 , or Gliese 892 ) is a main sequence star in the constellation of Cassiopeia . It is smaller and less luminous than our Sun , with a spectral class of K3V, which makes it an orange-red hued star. HR 8832 is relatively close to our system, with an estimated distance of 21.25 light years . This star is close to the limit of apparent magnitude that can still be seen by the unaided eye. The limit is considered to be magnitude 6 for most observers.  This star has a magnitude 9.4 companion at an angular separation of 106.6 arcseconds . 1 The star is reported to host a rocky super-Earth , HD 219134 b , based on size (1.6 times the size of Earth), and density (6 grams per cubic cm). 2 3 A further three exoplanets, two super-Earths and one Jovian world, have been deduced using Harps-N radial velocity data. 4  Distance          References  Notes  }}  External links     "  Category:Cassiopeia (constellation)  0892  Category:K-type main-sequence stars  Gliese, 0892  Category:Suspected variables  219134  8832      ↩  ↩  ↩
