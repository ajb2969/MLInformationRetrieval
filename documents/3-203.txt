Image (category theory)

Given a category C and a morphism

 
  in C, the image of f is a monomorphism

 
  satisfying the following universal property:

There exists a morphism 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 
 .
For any object Z with a morphism 
 
 
 
  and a monomorphism 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , there exists a unique morphism 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 
 .

Remarks:

such a factorization does not necessarily exist
g is unique by definition of monic (= left invertible, abstraction of injectivity)
m is monic.
h=lm already implies that m is unique.
k=mg

The image of f is often denoted by im f or Im(f).
One can show that a morphism f is monic if and only if f = im f.
Examples
In the category of sets the image of a morphism 
 
 
 
  is the inclusion from the ordinary image

 
  to 
 
 
 
 . In many concrete categories such as groups, abelian groups and (left- or right) modules, the image of a morphism is the image of the correspondent morphism in the category of sets.
In any normal category with a zero object and kernels and cokernels for every morphism, the image of a morphism 
 
 
 
  can be expressed as follows:

im f = ker coker f


This holds especially in abelian categories.
