   Image (category theory)      Image (category theory)   Given a category  C and a morphism     f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f\colon X\to Y   in C , the image of f is a monomorphism     h  :   I  →  Y      normal-:  h   normal-→  I  Y     h\colon I\to Y   satisfying the following universal property :   There exists a morphism    g  :   X  →  I      normal-:  g   normal-→  X  I     g\colon X\to I   such that    f  =   h  g       f    h  g     f=hg   .  For any object Z with a morphism    k  :   X  →  Z      normal-:  k   normal-→  X  Z     k\colon X\to Z   and a monomorphism    l  :   Z  →  Y      normal-:  l   normal-→  Z  Y     l\colon Z\to Y   such that    f  =   l  k       f    l  k     f=lk   , there exists a unique morphism    m  :   I  →  Z      normal-:  m   normal-→  I  Z     m\colon I\to Z   such that    h  =   l  m       h    l  m     h=lm   .   Remarks:   such a factorization does not necessarily exist  g is unique by definition of monic (= left invertible, abstraction of injectivity)  m is monic.  h = lm already implies that m is unique.  k = mg   (Figure)  Image diagram category theory.svg   The image of f is often denoted by im f or Im( f ).  One can show that a morphism f is monic if and only if f = im f .  Examples  In the category of sets the image of a morphism    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f\colon X\to Y   is the inclusion from the ordinary image     {   f   (  x  )    |   x  ∈  X   }     conditional-set    f  x     x  X     \{f(x)~{}|~{}x\in X\}   to   Y   Y   Y   . In many concrete categories such as groups , abelian groups and (left- or right) modules , the image of a morphism is the image of the correspondent morphism in the category of sets.  In any normal category with a zero object and kernels and cokernels for every morphism, the image of a morphism   f   f   f   can be expressed as follows:   im f = ker coker f    This holds especially in abelian categories .
