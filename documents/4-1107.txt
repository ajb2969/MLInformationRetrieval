   Pentatope number      Pentatope number   A pentatope number is a number in the fifth cell of any row of Pascal's triangle starting with the 5-term row 1 4 6 4 1 either from left to right or from right to left.  The first few numbers of this kind are :   1 , 5 , 15 , 35 , 70 , 126 , 210, 330, 495 , 715, 1001 , 1365   Pentatope numbers belong in the class of figurate numbers , which can be represented as regular, discrete geometric patterns. 1 The formula for the n th pentatopic number is:        (      n  +  3       4     )   =    n   (   n  +  1   )    (   n  +  2   )    (   n  +  3   )    24   =    n   4  ¯     4  !     .         binomial    n  3   4       n    n  1     n  2     n  3    24           superscript  n   normal-¯  4      4       {n+3\choose 4}=\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}={n^{\overline{4}}\over 4!}.     Two of every three pentatope numbers are also pentagonal numbers . To be precise, the (3 k − 2)th pentatope number is always the ((3 k 2 − k )/2)th pentagonal number and the (3 k − 1)th pentatope number is always the ((3 k 2 + k )/2)th pentagonal number. The 3 k th pentatope number is the generalized pentagonal number obtained by taking the negative index −(3 k 2 + k )/2 in the formula for pentagonal numbers. (These expressions always give integers). 2  The infinite sum of the reciprocals of all pentatopal numbers is    4  3      4  3    4\over 3   . 3 This can be derived using telescoping series .        ∑   n  =  1   ∞     4  !    n   (   n  +  1   )    (   n  +  2   )    (   n  +  3   )      =   4  3         superscript   subscript     n  1          4     n    n  1     n  2     n  3        4  3     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{4!\over{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}}={4\over 3}     Pentatopal numbers can also be represented as the sum of the first n tetrahedral numbers . 4  Test for pentatope numbers          24  n   +  1    +  1   2              24  n   1    1   2    \frac{\sqrt{24n+1}+1}{2}   is triangular number. then :     8  *       24  n   +  1    +  1   2    +  1        8            24  n   1    1   2    1    8*\frac{\sqrt{24n+1}+1}{2}+1   is perfect square.
