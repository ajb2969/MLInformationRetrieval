Acetate—CoA ligase (ADP-forming)




Acetate—CoA ligase (ADP-forming)

In enzymology, an acetate-CoA ligase (ADP-forming) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + acetate + CoA 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate + acetyl-CoA
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, acetate, and CoA, whereas its 3 products are ADP, phosphate, and acetyl-CoA.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetate:CoA ligase (ADP-forming). Other names in common use include acetyl-CoA synthetase (ADP-forming), acetyl coenzyme A synthetase (adenosine diphosphate-forming), and acetate thiokinase. This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism and propanoate metabolism.
