   Classical modular curve      Classical modular curve   In number theory , the classical modular curve is an irreducible plane algebraic curve given by an equation   0}} ,   such that     (  x  ,  y  )   =   (   j   (   n  τ   )    ,   j   (  τ  )    )        x  y      j    n  τ      j  τ      (x,y)=(j(nτ),j(τ))   is a point on the curve. Here    j   (  τ  )       j  τ    j(τ)   denotes the    j   j   j   -invariant .  The curve is sometimes called , though often that is used for the abstract algebraic curve for which there exist various models. A related object is the classical modular polynomial , a polynomial in one variable defined as .  It is important to note that the classical modular curves are part of the larger theory of modular curves . In particular it has another expression as a compactified quotient of the complex upper half-plane    𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   .  Geometry of the modular curve  The classical modular curve, which we will call , is of degree greater than or equal to    2  n      2  n    2n   when    n  >  1      n  1    n>1   , with equality if and only if   n   n   n   is a prime. The polynomial has integer coefficients, and hence is defined over every field. However, the coefficients are sufficiently large that computational work with the curve can be difficult. As a polynomial in   x   x   x   with coefficients in    𝐙  y  y      𝐙  y  y    \mathbf{Z}yy   , it has degree    ψ   (  n  )       ψ  n    ψ(n)   , where   ψ   ψ   ψ   is the Dedekind psi function . Since Φ n ( y , x )}} , is symmetrical around the line    y  =  x      y  x    y=x   , and has singular points at the repeated roots of the classical modular polynomial, where it crosses itself in the complex plane. These are not the only singularities, and in particular when    n  >  2      n  2    n>2   , there are two singularites at infinity, where     x  =  0   ,   y  =  ∞      formulae-sequence    x  0     y  normal-∞     x=0,y=∞   and     x  =  ∞   ,   y  =  0      formulae-sequence    x  normal-∞     y  0     x=∞,y=0   , which have only one branch and hence have a knot invariant which is a true knot, and not just a link.  Parametrization of the modular curve  For    n  =   1  ,  2  ,  3  ,  4  ,  5  ,  6  ,  7  ,  8  ,  9  ,  10  ,  12  ,  13  ,  16  ,  18       n   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  12  13  16  18     n=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,13,16,18   , or   25   25   25   , has genus zero, and hence can be parametrized 1 by rational functions. The simplest nontrivial example is , where:        j  2    (  q  )    =       q   -  1    -  24   +   276  q    -   2048   q  2     +   11202   q  3    +  ⋯   =    (    η   (  q  )     η   (   q  2   )     )   24            subscript  j  2   q            superscript  q    1    24     276  q      2048   superscript  q  2       11202   superscript  q  3    normal-⋯         superscript      η  q     η   superscript  q  2     24      j_{2}(q)=q^{-1}-24+276q-2048q^{2}+11202q^{3}+\cdots=\left(\frac{\eta(q)}{\eta(%
 q^{2})}\right)^{24}     is (up to the constant term) the McKay–Thompson series for the class 2B of the Monster , and   η   η   η   is the Dedekind eta function , then       x  =     (    j  2   +  256   )   3    j  2  2     ,      x     superscript     subscript  j  2   256   3    superscript   subscript  j  2   2      x=\frac{(j_{2}+256)^{3}}{j_{2}^{2}},         y  =     (    j  2   +  16   )   3    j  2        y     superscript     subscript  j  2   16   3    subscript  j  2      y=\frac{(j_{2}+16)^{3}}{j_{2}}     parametrizes in terms of rational functions of . It is not necessary to actually compute to use this parametrization; it can be taken as an arbitrary parameter.  Mappings  A curve   C   C   C   , over   𝐐   𝐐   \mathbf{Q}   is called a modular curve if for some   n   n   n   there exists a surjective morphism , given by a rational map with integer coefficients. The famous modularity theorem tells us that all elliptic curves over   𝐐   𝐐   \mathbf{Q}   are modular.  Mappings also arise in connection with since points on it correspond to   n   n   n   -isogenous pairs of elliptic curves. Two elliptic curves are isogenous if there is a morphism of varieties (defined by a rational map) between the curves which is also a group homomorphism, respecting the group law on the elliptic curves, and hence which sends the point at infinity (serving as the identity of the group law) to the point at infinity. The isogenies with cyclic kernel of degree   n   n   n   , the cyclic isogenies, correspond to points on .  When has genus one, it will itself be isomorphic to an elliptic curve, which will have the same    j   j   j   -invariant .  For instance, has   j   j   j   -invariant , and is isomorphic to the curve  x 3 − x 2 − 10 x − 20}} . If we substitute this value of   j   j   j   for   y   y   y   in , we obtain two rational roots and a factor of degree four. The two rational roots correspond to isomorphism classes of curves with rational coefficients which are 5-isogenous to the above curve, but not isomorphic, having a different function field. Specifically, we have the six rational points: x=-122023936/161051, y=-4096/11, x=-122023936/161051, y=-52893159101157376/11, and x=-4096/11, y=-52893159101157376/11, plus the three points exchanging   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   , all on , corresponding to the six isogenies between these three curves.  If in the curve  x 3 − x 2 − 10 x − 20}} , isomorphic to we substitute      x  ↦        x  5   -   2   x  4     +   3   x  3     -   2  x    +  1     x  2     (   x  -  1   )   2        maps-to  x             superscript  x  5     2   superscript  x  4       3   superscript  x  3       2  x    1      superscript  x  2    superscript    x  1   2       x\mapsto\frac{x^{5}-2x^{4}+3x^{3}-2x+1}{x^{2}(x-1)^{2}}         y  ↦   y  -     (    2  y   +  1   )    (       x  4   +   x  3    -   3   x  2     +   3  x    -  1   )      x  3     (   x  -  1   )   3         maps-to  y    y          2  y   1            superscript  x  4    superscript  x  3      3   superscript  x  2       3  x    1       superscript  x  3    superscript    x  1   3        y\mapsto y-\frac{(2y+1)(x^{4}+x^{3}-3x^{2}+3x-1)}{x^{3}(x-1)^{3}}     and factor, we get an extraneous factor of a rational function of   x   x   x   , and the curve  x 3 − x 2 }} , with   j   j   j   -invariant . Hence both curves are modular of level   11   11   11   , having mappings from .  By a theorem of Henri Carayol , if an elliptic curve   E   E   E   is modular then its conductor, an isogeny invariant described originally in terms of cohomology , is the smallest integer   n   n   n   such that there exists a rational mapping . Since we now know all elliptic curves over   𝐐   𝐐   \mathbf{Q}   are modular, we also know that the conductor is simply the level   n   n   n   of its minimal modular parametrization.  Galois theory of the modular curve  The Galois theory of the modular curve was investigated by Erich Hecke . Considered as a polynomial in x with coefficients in    𝐙  y  y      𝐙  y  y    \mathbf{Z}yy   , the modular equation is a polynomial of degree    ψ   (  n  )       ψ  n    ψ(n)   in   x   x   x   , whose roots generate a Galois extension of    𝐐   (  y  )       𝐐  y    \mathbf{Q}(y)   . In the case of with   p   p   p   prime, where the characteristic of the field is not   p   p   p   , the Galois group of      𝐐   (  x  ,  y  )    /  𝐐    (  y  )           𝐐   x  y    𝐐   y    \mathbf{Q}(x,y)/\mathbf{Q}(y)   is    P  G  L   (  2  ,  p  )       P  G  L   2  p     PGL(2,p)   , the projective general linear group of linear fractional transformations of the projective line of the field of   p   p   p   elements, which has    p  +  1      p  1    p+1   points, the degree of .  This extension contains an algebraic extension    F  /  𝐐      F  𝐐    F/\mathbf{Q}   where if     p  *   =     (   -  1   )     (   p  -  1   )   /  2    p        superscript  p       superscript    1       p  1   2    p     p^{*}=(-1)^{(p-1)/2}p   in the notation of Gauss then:       F  =   𝐐   (    p  *    )     .      F    𝐐     superscript  p        F=\mathbf{Q}\left(\sqrt{p^{*}}\right).     If we extend the field of constants to be   F   F   F   , we now have an extension with Galois group    P  S  L   (  2  ,  p  )       P  S  L   2  p     PSL(2,p)   , the projective special linear group of the field with   p   p   p   elements, which is a finite simple group. By specializing   y   y   y   to a specific field element, we can, outside of a thin set, obtain an infinity of examples of fields with Galois group    P  S  L   (  2  ,  p  )       P  S  L   2  p     PSL(2,p)   over   F   F   F   , and    P  G  L   (  2  ,  p  )       P  G  L   2  p     PGL(2,p)   over   𝐐   𝐐   \mathbf{Q}   .  When   n   n   n   is not a prime, the Galois groups can be analyzed in terms of the factors of   n   n   n   as a wreath product .
