Guy Terjanian

Guy Terjanian is a French1 mathematician who has worked on algebraic number theory. He achieved his Ph.D under Claude Chevalley in 1966,2 and at that time published a counterexample3 to the original form of a conjecture of Emil Artin, which suitably modified had just been proved as the Ax-Kochen theorem. He is ethnically Armenian.
In 1977, he proved that if p is an odd prime number, and the natural numbers x, y and z satisfy 
 
 
 
 , then 2p must divide x or y.4
