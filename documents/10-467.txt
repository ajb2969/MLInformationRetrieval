   Allyl-alcohol dehydrogenase      Allyl-alcohol dehydrogenase   In enzymology , an allyl-alcohol dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   allyl alcohol + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acrolein + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are allyl alcohol and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are acrolein , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is allyl-alcohol:NADP + oxidoreductase .  References     "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
