   Mellin inversion theorem      Mellin inversion theorem   In mathematics , the Mellin inversion formula (named after Hjalmar Mellin ) tells us conditions under which the inverse Mellin transform , or equivalently the inverse two-sided Laplace transform , are defined and recover the transformed function.  Method  If    φ   (  s  )       φ  s    \varphi(s)   is analytic in the strip    a  <   ℜ   (  s  )    <  b        a    s        b     a<\Re(s)   , and if it tends to zero uniformly as     ℑ   (  s  )    →   ±  ∞      normal-→    s    plus-or-minus      \Im(s)\to\pm\infty   for any real value c between a and b , with its integral along such a line converging absolutely, then if       f   (  x  )    =   {    ℳ   -  1    φ   }   =    1   2  π  i      ∫   c  -   i  ∞     c  +   i  ∞       x   -  s    φ   (  s  )   d  s             f  x       superscript  ℳ    1    φ             1    2  π  i      superscript   subscript     c    i        c    i         superscript  x    s    φ  s  d  s        f(x)=\{\mathcal{M}^{-1}\varphi\}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}x%
 ^{-s}\varphi(s)\,ds     we have that        φ   (  s  )    =   {   ℳ  f   }   =    ∫  0  ∞     x  s   f   (  x  )     d  x   x      .          φ  s      ℳ  f           superscript   subscript   0        superscript  x  s   f  x      d  x   x        \varphi(s)=\{\mathcal{M}f\}=\int_{0}^{\infty}x^{s}f(x)\,\frac{dx}{x}.     Conversely, suppose f ( x ) is piecewise continuous on the positive real numbers , taking a value halfway between the limit values at any jump discontinuities, and suppose the integral       φ   (  s  )    =    ∫  0  ∞     x  s   f   (  x  )     d  x   x           φ  s     superscript   subscript   0        superscript  x  s   f  x      d  x   x       \varphi(s)=\int_{0}^{\infty}x^{s}f(x)\,\frac{dx}{x}     is absolutely convergent when    a  <   ℜ   (  s  )    <  b        a    s        b     a<\Re(s)   . Then f is recoverable via the inverse Mellin transform from its Mellin transform   φ   φ   \varphi   .  Boundedness condition  We may strengthen the boundedness condition on    φ   (  s  )       φ  s    \varphi(s)   if f ( x ) is continuous. If    φ   (  s  )       φ  s    \varphi(s)   is analytic in the strip    a  <   ℜ   (  s  )    <  b        a    s        b     a<\Re(s)   , and if     |   φ   (  s  )    |   <   K    |  s  |    -  2             φ  s      K   superscript    s     2       |\varphi(s)|   , where K is a positive constant, then f ( x ) as defined by the inversion integral exists and is continuous; moreover the Mellin transform of f is   φ   φ   \varphi   for at least    a  <   ℜ   (  s  )    <  b        a    s        b     a<\Re(s)   .  On the other hand, if we are willing to accept an original f which is a generalized function , we may relax the boundedness condition on   φ   φ   \varphi   to simply make it of polynomial growth in any closed strip contained in the open strip    a  <   ℜ   (  s  )    <  b        a    s        b     a<\Re(s)   .  We may also define a Banach space version of this theorem. If we call by     L   ν  ,  p     (   R  +   )        subscript  L   ν  p     superscript  R      L_{\nu,p}(R^{+})   the weighted Lp space of complex valued functions f on the positive reals such that       ∥  f  ∥   =    (    ∫  0  ∞       |    x  ν   f   (  x  )    |   p      d  x   x     )    1  /  p    <  ∞         norm  f    superscript    superscript   subscript   0        superscript       superscript  x  ν   f  x    p       d  x   x       1  p             \|f\|=\left(\int_{0}^{\infty}|x^{\nu}f(x)|^{p}\,\frac{dx}{x}\right)^{1/p}<\infty     where ν and p are fixed real numbers with p >1, then if f ( x ) is in     L   ν  ,  p     (   R  +   )        subscript  L   ν  p     superscript  R      L_{\nu,p}(R^{+})   with    1  <  p  ≤  2        1  p       2     1   , then    φ   (  s  )       φ  s    \varphi(s)   belongs to     L   ν  ,  q     (   R  +   )        subscript  L   ν  q     superscript  R      L_{\nu,q}(R^{+})   with    q  =   p  /   (   p  -  1   )        q    p    p  1      q=p/(p-1)   and        f   (  x  )    =    1   2  π  i      ∫   ν  -   i  ∞     ν  +   i  ∞       x   -  s    φ   (  s  )   d  s      .        f  x       1    2  π  i      superscript   subscript     ν    i        ν    i         superscript  x    s    φ  s  d  s       f(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\nu-i\infty}^{\nu+i\infty}x^{-s}\varphi(s)\,ds.     Here functions, identical everywhere except on a set of measure zero, are identified.  Since the two-sided Laplace transform can be defined as        {   ℬ  f   }    (  s  )    =    {   ℳ  f   (   -   ln  x    )    }    (  s  )             ℬ  f    s        ℳ  f      x      s     \left\{\mathcal{B}f\right\}(s)=\left\{\mathcal{M}f(-\ln x)\right\}(s)     these theorems can be immediately applied to it also.
