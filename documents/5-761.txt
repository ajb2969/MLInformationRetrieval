Mellin inversion theorem

In mathematics, the Mellin inversion formula (named after Hjalmar Mellin) tells us conditions under which the inverse Mellin transform, or equivalently the inverse two-sided Laplace transform, are defined and recover the transformed function.
Method
If 
 
 
 
  is analytic in the strip 
 
 
 
 , and if it tends to zero uniformly as 
 
 
 
  for any real value c between a and b, with its integral along such a line converging absolutely, then if



we have that



Conversely, suppose f(x) is piecewise continuous on the positive real numbers, taking a value halfway between the limit values at any jump discontinuities, and suppose the integral



is absolutely convergent when 
 
 
 
 . Then f is recoverable via the inverse Mellin transform from its Mellin transform 
 
 
 
 .
Boundedness condition
We may strengthen the boundedness condition on 
 
 
 
  if f(x) is continuous. If 
 
 
 
  is analytic in the strip 
 
 
 
 , and if 
 
 
 
 , where K is a positive constant, then f(x) as defined by the inversion integral exists and is continuous; moreover the Mellin transform of f is 
 
 
 
  for at least 
 
 
 
 .
On the other hand, if we are willing to accept an original f which is a generalized function, we may relax the boundedness condition on 
 
 
 
  to simply make it of polynomial growth in any closed strip contained in the open strip 
 
 
 
 .
We may also define a Banach space version of this theorem. If we call by 
 
 
 
  the weighted Lp space of complex valued functions f on the positive reals such that



where Î½ and p are fixed real numbers with p>1, then if f(x) is in 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  belongs to 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and



Here functions, identical everywhere except on a set of measure zero, are identified.
Since the two-sided Laplace transform can be defined as



these theorems can be immediately applied to it also.
