   Methylated-DNA—(protein)-cysteine S-methyltransferase      Methylated-DNA—(protein)-cysteine S-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a methylated-DNA-[protein]-cysteine S-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   DNA (containing 6-O-methylguanine) + protein L-cysteine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   DNA (without 6-O-methylguanine) + protein S-methyl-L-cysteine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are DNA containing 6-O-methylguanine and protein L- cysteine , whereas its two products are DNA and protein S-methyl-L- cysteine . The S-methyl-L-cysteine residue irreversibly inactivates the protein, allowing only one transfer for each protein.  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is DNA-6-O-methylguanine:[protein]-L-cysteine S-methyltransferase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 11 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , and .
