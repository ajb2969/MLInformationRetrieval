   Myricetin O-methyltransferase      Myricetin O-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a myricetin O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + myricetin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + syringetin   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and myricetin , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and syringetin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:myricetin O-methyltransferase .
