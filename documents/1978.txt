   Polynomially reflexive space      Polynomially reflexive space   In mathematics , a polynomially reflexive space is a Banach space  X , on which the space of all polynomials in each degree is a reflexive space .  Given a multilinear  functional  M n of degree n (that is, M n is n -linear), we can define a polynomial p as       p   (  x  )    =    M  n    (  x  ,  …  ,  x  )          p  x      subscript  M  n    x  normal-…  x      p(x)=M_{n}(x,\dots,x)     (that is, applying M n on the diagonal ) or any finite sum of these. If only n -linear functionals are in the sum, the polynomial is said to be n -homogeneous.  We define the space P n as consisting of all n -homogeneous polynomials.  The P 1 is identical to the dual space , and is thus reflexive for all reflexive X . This implies that reflexivity is a prerequisite for polynomial reflexivity.  Relation to continuity of forms  On a finite-dimensional linear space, a quadratic form  x ↦ f ( x ) is always a (finite) linear combination of products x ↦ g ( x ) h ( x ) of two linear functionals  g and h . Therefore, assuming that the scalars are complex numbers, every sequence x n satisfying g ( x n ) → 0 for all linear functionals g , satisfies also f ( x n ) → 0 for all quadratic forms f .  In infinite dimension the situation is different. For example, in a Hilbert space , an orthonormal sequence x n  satisfies  g ( x n ) → 0 for all linear functionals g , and nevertheless f ( x n ) = 1 where f is the quadratic form f ( x ) = || x || 2 . In more technical words, this quadratic form fails to be weakly  sequentially continuous at the origin.  On a reflexive  Banach space with the approximation property the following two conditions are equivalent: 1   every quadratic form is weakly sequentially continuous at the origin;  the Banach space of all quadratic forms is reflexive.   Quadratic forms are 2-homogeneous polynomials. The equivalence mentioned above holds also for n -homogeneous polynomials, n =3,4,...  Examples  For the    ℓ  p     superscript  normal-ℓ  p    \ell^{p}    spaces , the P n is reflexive if and only if   n   n   n   $p$. Thus, no    ℓ  p     superscript  normal-ℓ  p    \ell^{p}   is polynomially reflexive. (    ℓ  ∞     superscript  normal-ℓ     \ell^{\infty}   is ruled out because it is not reflexive.)  Thus if a Banach space admits    ℓ  p     superscript  normal-ℓ  p    \ell^{p}   as a quotient space , it is not polynomially reflexive. This makes polynomially reflexive spaces rare.  The Tsirelson space  T * is polynomially reflexive. 2  Notes    References   Alencar, R., Aron, R. and S.
