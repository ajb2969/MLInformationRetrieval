Kynurenine—glyoxylate transaminase

In enzymology, a kynurenine-glyoxylate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-kynurenine + glyoxylate 
 
 
 
  4-(2-aminophenyl)-2,4-dioxobutanoate + glycine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-kynurenine and glyoxylate, whereas its two products are 4-(2-aminophenyl)-2,4-dioxobutanoate and glycine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-kynurenine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (cyclizing). This enzyme is also called kynurenine-glyoxylate aminotransferase.
