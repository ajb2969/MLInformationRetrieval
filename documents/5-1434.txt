   Al-Mahani      Al-Mahani   Abu-Abdullah Muhammad ibn Īsa Māhānī () was a Persian  Muslim 1 2 mathematician and astronomer from Mahan , Kermān , Persia .  A series of observations of lunar and solar eclipses and planetary conjunctions , made by him from 853 to 866, was in fact used by Ibn Yunus .  He wrote commentaries on Euclid and Archimedes , and improved Ishaq ibn Hunain 's translation of Menelaus of Alexandria 's Spherics . He tried vainly to solve an Archimedean problem : to divide a sphere by means of a plane into two segments being in a given ratio of volume . That problem led to a cubic equation ,        x  3   +    c  2   b    =   c   x  2           superscript  x  3      superscript  c  2   b      c   superscript  x  2      x^{3}+c^{2}b=cx^{2}     which Muslim writers called al-Mahani's equation .
