   Hartree product      Hartree product   The Hartree product is a system (many-particle) wavefunction, given as a combination of wavefunctions of the individual particle wavefunctions. It is inherently mean-field (assumes the particles are independent) and is the unsymmetrized version of the Slater determinant ansatz in the Hartree–Fock method .  For two particles,        Ψ   (   𝐱  1   ,   𝐱  2   )    =    χ  1    (   𝐱  1   )    χ  2    (   𝐱  2   )     .        normal-Ψ    subscript  𝐱  1    subscript  𝐱  2        subscript  χ  1    subscript  𝐱  1    subscript  χ  2    subscript  𝐱  2      \Psi(\mathbf{x}_{1},\mathbf{x}_{2})=\chi_{1}(\mathbf{x}_{1})\chi_{2}(\mathbf{x%
 }_{2}).     This is not satisfactory for fermions , such as electrons, because the resulting wave function is not antisymmetric. An antisymmetric wave function can be mathematically described using the Slater determinant .
