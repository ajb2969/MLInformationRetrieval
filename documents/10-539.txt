   Glyoxylate reductase (NADP+)      Glyoxylate reductase (NADP+)   In enzymology , a glyoxylate reductase (NADP + ) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   glycolate + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glyoxylate + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are glycolate and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are glyoxylate , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glycolate:NADP + oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include NADPH-glyoxylate reductase , and glyoxylate reductase (NADP + ) . This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
