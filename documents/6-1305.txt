   Y-homeomorphism      Y-homeomorphism   In mathematics , the y-homeomorphism , or crosscap slide , is a special type of auto- homeomorphism in non-orientable  surfaces .  It can be constructed by sliding a Möbius band included on the surface around an essential 1-sided  closed curve until the original position; thus it is necessary that the surfaces have genus greater than one. The projective plane    ℝ   P  2       ℝ   superscript  P  2     {\mathbb{R}P}^{2}   has no y-homeomorphism.  See also   Lickorish-Wallace theorem   References   J. S. Birman, D. R. J.
