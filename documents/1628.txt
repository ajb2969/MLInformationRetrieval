   Rheonomous      Rheonomous  A mechanical system is '''rheonomous''' if its equations of [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|constraints]] contain the time as an explicit variable. {{cite book |last=Goldstein |first=Herbert |authorlink=Herbert Goldstein |title=Classical Mechanics |year=1980 |location=United States of Americ a |publisher=Addison Wesley |edition=2nd |isbn=0-201-02918-9 |page=12 |quote=Constraints are further classified according as the equations of constraint contain the time as an explicit variable (rheonomous) or are not explicitly dependent on time (scleronomous).}} 1 Such constraints are called rheonomic constraints . The opposite of rheonomous is scleronomous . 2 3  Example: simple 2D pendulum  As shown at right, a simple pendulum is a system composed of a weight and a string. The string is attached at the top end to a pivot and at the bottom end to a weight. Being inextensible, the string has a constant length. Therefore this system is scleronomous; it obeys the scleronomic constraint          x  2   +   y  2     -  L   =  0             superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2     L   0    \sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}-L=0\,\!   , where    (  x  ,  y  )     x  y    (x,\ y)\,\!   is the position of the weight and   L   L   L\,\!   the length of the string.  The situation changes if the pivot point is moving, e.g. undergoing a simple harmonic motion       x  t   =    x  0    cos   ω  t          subscript  x  t      subscript  x  0       ω  t       x_{t}=x_{0}\cos\omega t\,\!   , where    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}\,\!   is the amplitude,   ω   ω   \omega\,\!   the angular frequency, and   t   t   t\,\!   time.  Although the top end of the string is not fixed, the length of this inextensible string is still a constant. The distance between the top end and the weight must stay the same. Therefore this system is rheonomous; it obeys the rheonomic constraint           (   x  -    x  0    cos   ω  t      )   2   +   y  2     -  L   =  0             superscript    x     subscript  x  0       ω  t      2    superscript  y  2     L   0    \sqrt{(x-x_{0}\cos\omega t)^{2}+y^{2}}-L=0\,\!   .
