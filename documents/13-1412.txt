   GJMS operator      GJMS operator   In the mathematical field of differential geometry , the GJMS operators are a family of differential operators , that are defined on a Riemannian manifold . In an appropriate sense, they depend only on the conformal structure of the manifold. The GJMS operators generalize the Paneitz operator and the conformal Laplacian . The initials GJMS are for its discoverers Graham, Jenne, Mason & Sparling (1992) .  Properly, the GJMS operator on a conformal manifold of dimension n is a conformally invariant operator between the line bundle of conformal densities of weight  for k a positive integer        L  k   :    E   [   k  -   n  /  2    ]    →   E   [    -  k   -   n  /  2    ]      .     normal-:   subscript  L  k    normal-→    E   delimited-[]    k    n  2        E   delimited-[]      k     n  2         L_{k}:E[k-n/2]\to E[-k-n/2].   The operators have leading symbol given by a power of the Laplace–Beltrami operator , and have lower order correction terms that ensure conformal invariance.  The original construction of the GJMS operators used the ambient construction of Charles Fefferman and Robin Graham . A conformal density defines, in a natural way, a function on the null cone in the ambient space. The GJMS operator is defined by taking density ƒ of the appropriate weight  and extending it arbitrarily to a function F off the null cone so that it still retains the same homogeneity. The function Δ k F , where Δ is the ambient Laplace–Beltrami operator , is then homogeneous of degree , and its restriction to the null cone does not depend on how the original function ƒ was extended to begin with, and so is independent of choices. The GJMS operator also represents the obstruction term to a formal asymptotic solution of the Cauchy problem for extending a weight  function off the null cone in the ambient space to a harmonic function in the full ambient space.  The most important GJMS operators are the critical GJMS operators. In even dimension n , these are the operators L n /2 that take a true function on the manifold and produce a multiple of the volume form .  References    .
