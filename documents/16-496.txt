   Maxwell‚ÄìJ√ºttner distribution      Maxwell‚ÄìJ√ºttner distribution   In physics , the Maxwell‚ÄìJ√ºttner distribution is the distribution of speeds of particles in a hypothetical gas of relativistic particles. Similar to Maxwell's distribution , the Maxwell‚ÄìJ√ºttner distribution considers a classical ideal gas where the particles are dilute and do not significantly interact with each other. The distinction from Maxwell's case is that effects of special relativity are taken into account. In the limit of low temperatures T much less than mc 2 / k (where m is the mass of the kind of particle making up the gas, c is the speed of light and k is Boltzmann's constant ), this distribution becomes identical to the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution.  The distribution can be attributed to Ferencz J√ºttner , who derived it in 1911. 1 It has become known as the Maxwell‚ÄìJ√ºttner distribution by analogy to the name Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution that is commonly used to refer to Maxwell's distribution.

Speed is represented in terms of the Lorentz factor .  As the gas becomes hotter and kT approaches or exceeds mc 2 , the probability distribution for    Œ≥  =   1  /    1  -    v  2   /   c  2           Œ≥    1      1     superscript  v  2    superscript  c  2         \gamma=1/\sqrt{1-v^{2}/c^{2}}   in this relativistic Maxwellian gas is given by the Maxwell‚ÄìJ√ºttner distribution: 2       f   (  Œ≥  )    =      Œ≥  2   Œ≤    Œ∏   K  2    (   1  /  Œ∏   )      exp   (   -   Œ≥  Œ∏    )           f  Œ≥          superscript  Œ≥  2   Œ≤     Œ∏   subscript  K  2     1  Œ∏           Œ≥  Œ∏        f(\gamma)=\frac{\gamma^{2}\beta}{\theta K_{2}(1/\theta)}\exp\left(-\frac{%
 \gamma}{\theta}\right)     where     Œ≤  =   v  c   =    1  -   1  /   Œ≥  2       ,        Œ≤    v  c            1    1   superscript  Œ≥  2         \beta=\frac{v}{c}=\sqrt{1-1/\gamma^{2}},        Œ∏  =    k  T    m   c  2      ,      Œ∏      k  T     m   superscript  c  2       \theta=\frac{kT}{mc^{2}},   and    K  2     subscript  K  2    K_{2}   is the modified Bessel function of the second kind.  Alternatively, this can be written in terms of the momentum as       f   (  ùê©  )    =    1   4  œÄ   m  3    c  3   Œ∏   K  2    (   1  /  Œ∏   )      exp   (   -    Œ≥   (  p  )    Œ∏    )           f  ùê©       1    4  œÄ   superscript  m  3    superscript  c  3   Œ∏   subscript  K  2     1  Œ∏             Œ≥  p   Œ∏        f(\mathbf{p})=\frac{1}{4\pi m^{3}c^{3}\theta K_{2}(1/\theta)}\exp\left(-\frac{%
 \gamma(p)}{\theta}\right)     where     Œ≥   (  p  )    =    1  +    (   p   m  c    )   2           Œ≥  p       1   superscript    p    m  c    2       \gamma(p)=\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{p}{mc}\right)^{2}}   . The Maxwell‚ÄìJ√ºttner equation is covariant, but not manifestly so, and the temperature of the gas does not vary with the gross speed of the gas. 3  Limitations  Some limitations of the Maxwell‚ÄìJ√ºttner distributions are shared with the classical ideal gas: neglect of interactions, and neglect of quantum effects. An additional limitation (not important in the classical ideal gas) is that the Maxwell‚ÄìJ√ºttner distribution neglects antiparticles.  If particle-antiparticle creation is allowed, then once the thermal energy kT is a significant fraction of mc 2 , particle-antiparticle creation will occur and begin to increase the number of particles while generating antiparticles (the number of particles is not conserved, but instead the conserved quantity is the difference between particle number and antiparticle number). The resulting thermal distribution will depend on the chemical potential relating to the conserved particle-antiparticle number difference. A further consequence of this is that it becomes necessary to incorporate statistical mechanics for indistinguishable particles, because the occupation probabilities for low kinetic energy states becomes of order unity. For fermions it is necessary to use Fermi‚ÄìDirac statistics and the result is analogous to the thermal generation of electron- hole pairs in semiconductors . For bosonic particles, it is necessary to use the Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics . 4  References    "  Concepts in physics  Category:Special relativity  Category:Continuous distributions  Category:Gases    Category:Particle distributions  Category:Probability distributions     ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©  See first few paragraphs in 1 for extended discussion. ‚Ü©
