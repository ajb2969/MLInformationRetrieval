   Free presentation      Free presentation   In algebra, a free presentation of a module M over a commutative ring R is an exact sequence of R -modules:         ⊕   i  ∈  I     R   →  𝑓     ⊕   j  ∈  J     R   →  𝑔   M      →  0   ,     normal-→    subscript  direct-sum    i  I      R   f  normal-→     subscript  direct-sum    j  J      R   g  normal-→   M      0    \bigoplus_{i\in I}R\overset{f}{\to}\bigoplus_{j\in J}R\overset{g}{\to}M\to 0,     where g maps each basis element to each generator of M (in general, the image of a generating set generates the image). In particular, if J is finite, then M is a finitely generated module . If I and J are finite sets, then the presentation is called a finite presentation ; a module is called finitely presented if it admits a finite presentation.  A free presentation always exists: any module is a quotient of free module     F   →  𝑔   M   →  0     normal-→    F   g  normal-→   M   0    F\overset{g}{\to}M\to 0   , but then the kernel of g is again a quotient of a free module      F  ′    →  𝑓    ker  g    →  0     normal-→     superscript  F  normal-′    f  normal-→    kernel  g    0    F^{\prime}\overset{f}{\to}\ker g\to 0   . The combination of f and g is a free presentation of M . Now, one can obviously keep "resolving" the kernels in this fashion; the result is called a free resolution . Thus, a free presentation is the early part of the free resolution.  A presentation is useful for computaion. For example, since tensoring is right-exact, tensoring the above presentation with a module, say, N gives:        ⊕   i  ∈  I     N   →   f  ⊗  1      ⊕   j  ∈  J    N     →   M   ⊗  R   N   →  0.       normal-→    subscript  direct-sum    i  I      N    tensor-product  f  1   normal-→     subscript  direct-sum    j  J    N       subscript  tensor-product  R   M  N     normal-→    0.     \bigoplus_{i\in I}N\overset{f\otimes 1}{\to}\bigoplus_{j\in J}N\to M\otimes_{R%
 }N\to 0.     This says that    M   ⊗  R   N      subscript  tensor-product  R   M  N    M\otimes_{R}N   is the cokernel of    f  ⊗  1     tensor-product  f  1    f\otimes 1   . If N is an R -algebra, then this is the presentation of the N -module    M   ⊗  R   N      subscript  tensor-product  R   M  N    M\otimes_{R}N   ; that is, the presentation extends under base extension.  For left-exact functors, there is for example  Proof: Applying F to a finite presentation     R   ⊕  n    →   R   ⊕  m    →  M       normal-→   superscript  R   direct-sum  n     superscript  R   direct-sum  m      normal-→    M     R^{\oplus n}\to R^{\oplus m}\to M   results in      0  →   F   (  M  )    →   F   (   R   ⊕  m    )    →   F   (   R   ⊕  n    )         normal-→  0    F  M     normal-→      F   superscript  R   direct-sum  m       normal-→      F   superscript  R   direct-sum  n        0\to F(M)\to F(R^{\oplus m})\to F(R^{\oplus n})   and the same for G .
