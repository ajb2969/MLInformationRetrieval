Free presentation

In algebra, a free presentation of a module M over a commutative ring R is an exact sequence of R-modules:



where g maps each basis element to each generator of M (in general, the image of a generating set generates the image). In particular, if J is finite, then M is a finitely generated module. If I and J are finite sets, then the presentation is called a finite presentation; a module is called finitely presented if it admits a finite presentation.
A free presentation always exists: any module is a quotient of free module
 
 
 
 , but then the kernel of g is again a quotient of a free module
 
 
 
 . The combination of f and g is a free presentation of M. Now, one can obviously keep "resolving" the kernels in this fashion; the result is called a free resolution. Thus, a free presentation is the early part of the free resolution.
A presentation is useful for computaion. For example, since tensoring is right-exact, tensoring the above presentation with a module, say, N gives:



This says that 
 
 
 
  is the cokernel of 
 
 
 
 . If N is an R-algebra, then this is the presentation of the N-module 
 
 
 
 ; that is, the presentation extends under base extension.
For left-exact functors, there is for example  Proof: Applying F to a finite presentation 
 
 
 
  results in


 
  and the same for G. Now apply the snake lemma.
