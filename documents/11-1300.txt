   Lactosylceramide alpha-2,6-N-sialyltransferase      Lactosylceramide alpha-2,6-N-sialyltransferase   In enzymology , a lactosylceramide alpha-2,6-N-sialyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   CMP-N-acetylneuraminate + beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-beta-D-glucosylceramide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CMP + alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl-2,6-beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-beta-D- glucosylceramide   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CMP-N-acetylneuraminate and beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-beta-D-glucosylceramide , whereas its 3 products are CMP , alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl-2,6-beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-beta-D- , and glucosylceramide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those glycosyltransferases that do not transfer hexosyl or pentosyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is CMP-N-acetylneuraminate:lactosylceramide alpha-2,6-N-acetylneuraminyltransferase . Other names in common use include cytidine monophosphoacetylneuraminate-lactosylceramide , sialyltransferase , CMP-acetylneuraminate-lactosylceramide-sialyltransferase , CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid:lactosylceramide sialyltransferase , CMP-sialic acid:lactosylceramide sialyltransferase , cytidine monophosphoacetylneuraminate-lactosylceramide , and sialyltransferase .
