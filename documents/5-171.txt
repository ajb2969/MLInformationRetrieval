   Reduction of the structure group      Reduction of the structure group   In mathematics , in particular the theory of principal bundles , one can ask if a principal   G   G   G   -bundle over a group    G   G   G   "comes from" a subgroup    H   H   H   of   G   G   G   . This is called reduction of the structure group (to   H   H   H   ), and makes sense for any map    H  →  G     normal-→  H  G    H\to G   , which need not be an inclusion map (despite the terminology).  Definition  Formally, given a G -bundle B and a map H → G (which need not be an inclusion ), a reduction of the structure group (from G to H ) is an H -bundle    B  H     subscript  B  H    B_{H}   such that the associated bundle     B  H    ×  H   G      superscript   H    subscript  B  H   G    B_{H}\times^{H}G   is isomorphic to B .  Note that these do not always exist, nor if they exist are they unique.  As a concrete example, every even-dimensional real vector space is the underlying real space of a complex vector space: it admits a linear complex structure . A real vector bundle admits an almost complex structure if and only if it is the underlying real bundle of a complex vector bundle. This is a reduction along the inclusion GL ( n , C ) → GL (2 n , R )  In terms of transition maps , a G -bundle can be reduced if and only if the transition maps can be taken to have values in H . Note that the term reduction is misleading: it suggests that H is a subgroup of G , which is often the case, but need not be (for example for spin structures ): it's properly called a lifting .  More abstractly, " G -bundles over X " is a functor 1 in G : given a map H → G , one gets a map from H -bundles to G -bundles by inducing (as above). Reduction of the structure group of a G -bundle B is choosing an H -bundle whose image is B .  The inducing map from H -bundles to G -bundles is in general neither onto nor one-to-one, so the structure group cannot always be reduced, and when it can, this reduction need not be unique. For example, not every manifold is orientable , and those that are orientable admit exactly two orientations.  If H is a Lie subgroup of G , then there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between reductions of a G -bundle B to H and global sections of the fiber bundle  B / H obtained by quotienting B by the right action of H . Specifically, the fibration  B → B / H is a principal H -bundle over B / H . If σ : X → B / H is a section, then the pullback bundle  B H = σ −1 B is a reduction of B . 2  Examples  Examples for vector bundles , particularly the tangent bundle of a manifold :        G   L  +    <   G  L         G   superscript  L       G  L     GL^{+}   is an orientation , and this is possible if and only if the bundle is orientable       S  L   <   G  L         S  L     G  L     SL   is a volume form ; since     S  L   →   G   L  +       normal-→    S  L     G   superscript  L       SL\to GL^{+}   is a deformation retract , a volume form exists if and only if a bundle is orientable       S   L  ±    <   G  L         S   superscript  L  plus-or-minus      G  L     SL^{\pm}   is a pseudo- volume form , and this is always possible       O   (  n  )    <   G  L   (  n  )          O  n     G  L  n     O(n)   is a Riemannian metric; as    O   (  n  )       O  n    O(n)   is the maximal compact subgroup (so the inclusion is a deformation retract), this is always possible       O   (  1  ,   n  -  1   )    <   G  L   (  n  )          O   1    n  1       G  L  n     O(1,n-1)   is a pseudo-Riemannian metric; 3 there is the topological obstruction to this reduction       G  L   (  n  ,  𝐂  )    <   G  L   (   2  n   ,  𝐑  )          G  L   n  𝐂      G  L     2  n   𝐑      GL(n,\mathbf{C})   is an almost complex structure         G  L   (  n  ,  𝐇  )    ⋅  S   p   (  1  )    <   G  L   (   4  n   ,  𝐑  )           normal-⋅    G  L   n  𝐇    S   p  1     G  L     4  n   𝐑      GL(n,\mathbf{H})\cdot Sp(1)   (where    G  L   (  n  ,  𝐇  )       G  L   n  𝐇     GL(n,\mathbf{H})   is the group of n×n invertible quaternionic matrices acting on     𝐇  n   ≅   𝐑   4  n         superscript  𝐇  n    superscript  𝐑    4  n      \mathbf{H}^{n}\cong\mathbf{R}^{4n}   on the left and Sp(1)=Spin(3) the group of unit quaternions acting on    𝐇  n     superscript  𝐇  n    \mathbf{H}^{n}   from the right ) is an almost quaternionic structure 4       Spin   (  n  )    →   SO   (  n  )       normal-→    Spin  n     SO  n     \mbox{Spin}(n)\to\mbox{SO}(n)   (which is not an inclusion: it's a 2-fold covering space ) is a spin structure .         G  L   (  k  )    ×  G   L   (   n  -  k   )    <   G  L   (  n  )              G  L  k   G   L    n  k      G  L  n     GL(k)\times GL(n-k)   decomposes a vector bundle as a Whitney sum (direct sum) of sub-bundles of rank k and n − k .   Integrability  Many geometric structures are stronger than G -structures; they are G -structures with an integrability condition . Thus such a structure requires a reduction of the structure group (and can be obstructed, as below), but this is not sufficient. Examples include complex structure , symplectic structure (as opposed to almost complex structures and almost symplectic structures ).  Another example is for a foliation , which requires a reduction of the tangent bundle to a block matrix subgroup, together with an integrability condition so that the Frobenius theorem applies.
