   Complex gain      Complex gain   In electronics , Complex gain is the effect circuitry has on the amplitude and phase of a sine wave signal. The term complex is used because mathematically this effect can be expressed as a complex number .  Example  Suppose a circuit has an input voltage described by the equation        V  i    (  t  )    =    1  V   ⋅   sin   (   ω  ⋅  t   )            subscript  V  i   t    normal-⋅    1  V      normal-⋅  ω  t       V_{i}(t)=1V\cdot\sin(\omega\cdot t)     where ω equals 2π×100Hz, i.e., the input signal is a 100Hz sine wave with an amplitude of 1 Volt.  If the circuit is such that for this frequency it doubles the signal's amplitude and causes a 90 degrees forward phase shift, then its output signal can be described by        V  o    (  t  )    =    2  V   ⋅   cos   (   ω  ⋅  t   )            subscript  V  o   t    normal-⋅    2  V      normal-⋅  ω  t       V_{o}(t)=2V\cdot\cos(\omega\cdot t)     In complex notation, these signals can be described as, for this frequency, j ·1V and 2V, respectively.  The complex gain G of this circuit is then computed by dividing output by input:       G  =    2  V     j  ⋅  1   V    =   -   2  j     .        G      2  V      normal-⋅  j  1   V             2  j       G=\frac{2V}{j\cdot 1V}=-2j.     This (unitless) complex number incorporates both the magnitude of the change in amplitude (as the absolute value ) and the phase change (as the argument ).  "  Category:Electronics
