   Hammer projection      Hammer projection   The Hammer projection is an equal-area map projection described by Ernst Hammer in 1892. Using the same 2:1 elliptical outer shape as the Mollweide projection , Hammer intended to reduce distortion toward the outer limbs, where it is extreme in the Mollweide.  Development  Directly inspired by the Aitoff projection , Hammer suggested the use of the equatorial form of the Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection instead of Aitoff's use of the azimuthal equidistant projection :      x  =    laea  x    (   λ  2   ,  ϕ  )        x     subscript  laea  x      λ  2   ϕ      x=\mathrm{laea}_{x}\left(\frac{\lambda}{2},\phi\right)         y  =    1  2    laea  y    (   λ  2   ,  ϕ  )        y      1  2    subscript  laea  y      λ  2   ϕ      y=\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{laea}_{y}\left(\frac{\lambda}{2},\phi\right)     where    laea  x     subscript  laea  x    \mathrm{laea}_{x}   and    laea  y     subscript  laea  y    \mathrm{laea}_{y}   are the x and y components of the equatorial Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection. Written out explicitly:      x  =    2   2    cos   (  ϕ  )     sin   (   λ  2   )       1  +    cos   (  ϕ  )     cos   (   λ  2   )            x      2    2     ϕ       λ  2         1      ϕ       λ  2          x=\frac{2\sqrt{2}\cos(\phi)\sin\left(\frac{\lambda}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{1+\cos(%
 \phi)\cos\left(\frac{\lambda}{2}\right)}}         y  =     2    sin   (  ϕ  )       1  +    cos   (  ϕ  )     cos   (   λ  2   )            y        2     ϕ        1      ϕ       λ  2          y=\frac{\sqrt{2}\sin(\phi)}{\sqrt{1+\cos(\phi)\cos\left(\frac{\lambda}{2}%
 \right)}}     The inverse is calculated with the intermediate variable      z  ≡    1  -    (    1  4   x   )   2   -    (    1  2   y   )   2         z      1   superscript      1  4   x   2    superscript      1  2   y   2       z\equiv\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{1}{4}x\right)^{2}-\left(\frac{1}{2}y\right)^{2}}     The longitude and latitudes can then be calculated by     λ   λ   \displaystyle\lambda     where   λ   λ   \lambda   is the longitude from the central meridian and   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is the latitude . 1 2  Visually, the Aitoff and Hammer projections are very similar. The Hammer has seen more use because of its equal-area property. The Mollweide projection is another equal-area projection of similar aspect, though with straight parallels of latitude, unlike the Hammer's curved parallels.  Briesemeister  William A. Briesemeister presented a variant of the Hammer in 1953. In this version, the central meridian is set to 10°E, the coordinate system is rotated to bring the 45°N parallel to the center, and the resulting map is squashed horizontally and reciprocally stretched vertically to achieve a 1.75:1.0 aspect ratio instead of the 2:1 of the Hammer. The purpose is to present the land masses more centrally and with lower distortion. 3  Nordic  Before projecting to Hammer, John Bartholomew rotated the coordinate system to bring the 45° north parallel to the center, leaving the prime meridian as the central meridian. He called this variant the "Nordic" projection. 4  See also   List of map projections  Mollweide projection  Aitoff projection   References  External links   Table of common projections  An interactive Java Applet to study the metric deformations of the Hammer–Aitoff Projection .
