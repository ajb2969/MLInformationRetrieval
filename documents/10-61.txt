Proof that π is irrational

In the 18th century, Johann Heinrich Lambert proved that the number 

 (pi) is irrational, that is, that it cannot be expressed as a fraction a/b, where a is an integer and b is a non-zero integer. In the 19th century, Charles Hermite found a proof that requires no prerequisite knowledge beyond basic calculus. Three simplifications of Hermite's proof are due to Mary Cartwright, to Ivan Niven and to Bourbaki. Another proof, which is a simplification of Lambert's proof, is due to Miklós Laczkovich.
In 1882, Ferdinand von Lindemann proved that 
 
 
 
  is not just irrational, but transcendental as well.1
Lambert's proof
 In 1761, Lambert proved that 
 
 
 
  is irrational by first showing that this continued fraction expansion holds:



Then Lambert proved that if x is non-zero and rational then this expression must be irrational. Since tan(
 
 
 
 /4) = 1, it follows that 
 
 
 
 /4 is irrational and therefore that 
 
 
 
  is irrational.2 A simplification of Lambert's proof is given below.
Hermite's proof
This proof uses the characterization of 
 
 
 
  as the smallest positive number whose half is a zero of the cosine function and it actually proves that 
 
 
2 is irrational.34 As in many proofs of irrationality, the argument proceeds by reductio ad absurdum.
Consider the sequences (An)n ≥ 0 and (Un)n ≥ 0 of functions from R into R thus defined:














It can be proved by induction that


 
  and that


 
  and therefore that


 
  So


 
  which is equivalent to


 
  It follows by induction from this, together with the fact that A0(x) = sin(x) and that A1(x) = −x cos(x) + sin(x), that An(x) can be written as Pn(x2)sin(x) + xQn(x2)cos(x), where Pn and Qn are polynomial functions with integer coefficients and where the degree of Pn is smaller than or equal to ⌊n⁄2⌋. In particular, An(
 
 
 
 /2) = Pn(
 
 
2/4).
Hermite also gave a closed expression for the function An, namely


 
  He did not justify this assertion, but it can be proved easily. First of all, this assertion is equivalent to


 
  Proceeding by induction, take n = 0.


 
  and, for the inductive step, consider any n ∈ Z+. If



then, using integration by parts and Leibniz's rule, one gets



If 
 
 
2/4 = p/q, with p and q in N, then, since the coefficients of Pn are integers and its degree is smaller than or equal to ⌊n⁄2⌋, q⌊n/2⌋Pn(
 
 
2/4) is some integer N. In other words,



But this number is clearly greater than 0; therefore, N ∈ N. On the other hand, the integral that appears here is not greater than 1 and



So, if n is large enough, N $\pi$. He discussed the recurrence relations to motivate and to obtain a convenient integral representation. Once this integral representation is obtained, there are various ways to present a succinct and self-contained proof starting from the integral (as in Cartwright's, Bourbaki's or Niven's presentations), which Hermite could easily see (as he did in his proof of the transcendence of e5).
Moreover, Hermite's proof is closer to Lambert's proof than it seems. In fact, An(x) is the "residue" (or "remainder") of Lambert's continued fraction for tan(x).6
Cartwright's proof
Harold Jeffreys wrote that this proof was set as an example in an exam at Cambridge University in 1945 by Mary Cartwright, but that she had not traced its origin.7
Consider the integrals


 
  where n is a non-negative integer.
Two integrations by parts give the recurrence relation



If


 
  then this becomes



Furthermore, J0(x) = 2sin(x) and J1(x) = −4x cos(x) + 4sin(x). Hence for all n ∈ Z+,



where Pn(x) and Qn(x) are polynomials of degree ≤ 2n, and with integer coefficients (depending on n).
Take x = 

⁄2, and suppose if possible that 

⁄2 = b⁄a, where a and b are natural numbers (i.e., assume that 
 
 
 
  is rational). Then



The right side is an integer. But 0 n(

⁄2)  \frac{b^{2n+1}}{n!} \to 0\text{ as }n \to \infty. 
Hence for sufficiently large n



that is, we could find an integer between 0 and 1. That is the contradiction that follows from the assumption that 
 
 
 
 
  is rational.
This proof is similar to Hermite's proof. Indeed,


 
 
  However, it is clearly simpler. This is achieved by passing the inductive definition of the functions An and taking as a starting point their expression as an integral.
Niven's proof
This proof uses the characterization of 
 
 
 
  as the smallest positive zero of the sine function.8
Suppose that 
 
 
 
  is rational, i.e.  for some integers a and , which may be taken without loss of generality to be positive. Given any positive integer n, we define the polynomial function f from R into R defined by



and, for each x ∈ R denote by



the alternating sum of f and its first n derivatives of even order.
Claim 1:  is an integer.
Proof: Expanding f as a sum of monomials, the coefficient of xk is a number of the form  where ck is an integer, which is 0 if . Therefore,  is 0 when  and it is equal to  if ; in each case,  is an integer and therefore F(0) is an integer.
On the other hand, = f(x) and so =  for each non-negative integer k. In particular, =  Therefore,  is also an integer and so F(
 
 
 
 ) is an integer (in fact, it is easy to see that F(
 
 
 
 ) = F(0), but that is not relevant to the proof). Since F(0) and F(
 
 
 
 ) are integers, so is their sum.
Claim 2:



Proof: Since  is the zero polynomial, we have



The derivatives of the sine and cosine function are given by sin' = cos and cos' = −sin. Hence the product rule implies



By the fundamental theorem of calculus



Since  and  (here we use the above-mentioned characterization of 
 
 
 
  as a zero of the sine function), Claim 2 follows.
Conclusion: Since  and  for  (because 
 
 
 
  is the smallest positive zero of the sine function), Claims 1 and 2 show that  is a positive integer. Since  and  for , we have, by the original definition of f,



which is smaller than 1 for large n, hence  for these n, by Claim 2. This is impossible for the positive integer .
The above proof is a polished version, which is kept as simple as possible concerning the prerequisites, of an analysis of the formula



which is obtained by  integrations by parts. Claim 2 essentially establishes this formula, where the use of F hides the iterated integration by parts. The last integral vanishes because  is the zero polynomial. Claim 1 shows that the remaining sum is an integer.
Niven's proof is closer to Cartwright's (and therefore Hermite's) proof than it appears at first sight.9 In fact,


 
 
  Therefore, the substitution xz = y turns this integral into


 
  In particular,



Another connection between the proofs lies in the fact that Hermite already mentions10 that if f is a polynomial function and


 
  then


 
  from which it follows that



Bourbaki's proof
Bourbaki's proof is outlined as an exercise in his Calculus treatise.11 For each natural number b and each non-negative integer n, define


 
  Since An(b) is the integral of a function which defined on [0,
 
 
 
 ] that takes the value 0 on 0 and on 
 
 
 
  and which is greater than 0 otherwise, An(b) > 0. Besides, for each natural number b, An(b) (\forall x\in[0,\pi]):x(\pi-x)\le\left(\frac\pi2\right)^2 and therefore



On the other hand, recursive integration by parts allows us to deduce that, if a and b are natural number such that 
 
 
 
  = a/b and f is the polynomial function from [0,
 
 
 
 ] into R defined by


 
  then:


 
 
  This last integral , since f(2n + 1) is the null function (because f is a polynomial function whose degree is 2n). Since each function f(k) (with ) takes integer values on 0 and on 
 
 
 
  (see Claim 1 from Niven's proof) and since the same thing happens with the sine and the cosine functions, this proves that An(b) is an integer. Since it is also greater than 0, it must be a natural number. But it was also proved that An(b) n(b'') are integers.
Laczkovich's proof
Miklós Laczkovich's proof is a simplification of Lambert's original proof.12 He considers the functions



These functions are clearly defined for all x ∈ R. Besides



Claim 1: The following recurrence relation holds:



Proof: This can be proved by comparing the coefficients of the powers of x.
Claim 2: For each x ∈ R, 
 
 

Proof: In fact, the sequence x2n/n! is bounded (since it converges to 0) and if C is an upper bound and if k > 1, then



Claim 3: If x ≠ 0 and if x2 is rational, then



Proof: Otherwise, there would be a number y ≠ 0 and integers a and b such that fk(x) = ay and fk + 1(x) = by. In order to see why, take y = fk + 1(x), a = 0 and b = 1 if fk(x) = 0; otherwise, choose integers a and b such that fk + 1(x)/fk(x) = b/a and define y = fk(x)/a = fk + 1(x)/b. In each case, y cannot be 0, because otherwise it would follow from claim 1 that each fk + n(x) (n ∈ N) would be 0, which would contradict claim 2. Now, take a natural number c such that all three numbers bc/k, ck/x2 and c/x2 are integers and consider the sequence



Then



On the other hand, it follows from claim 1 that



which is a linear combination of gn + 1 and gn with integer coefficients. Therefore, each gn is an integer multiple of y. Besides, it follows from claim 2 that each gn is greater than 0 (and therefore that gn ≥ |y|) if n is large enough and that the sequence of all gn's converges to 0. But a sequence of numbers greater than or equal to |y| cannot converge to 0.
Since f1/2(
 
 
 
 /4) = cos(
 
 
 
 /2) = 0, it follows from claim 3 that 
 
 
2/16 is irrational and therefore that 
 
 
 
  is irrational.
On the other hand, since



another consequence of claim 3 is that, if x ∈ Q\{0}, then tan x is irrational.
Laczkovich's proof is really about the hypergeometric function. In fact, fk(x) = 0F1(k; −x2) and Gauss found a continued fraction expansion of the hypergeometric function using its functional equation.13 This allowed Laczkovich to find a new and simpler proof of the fact that the tangent function has the continued fraction expansion that Lambert had discovered.
Laczkovich's result can also be expressed in Bessel functions of the first kind Jν(x). In fact, Γ(k)Jk − 1(2x) = xk − 1fk(x). So Laczkovich's result is equivalent to: If x ≠ 0 and if x2 is rational, then
