   Hydrogen dehydrogenase (NADP+)      Hydrogen dehydrogenase (NADP+)   In enzymology , a hydrogen dehydrogenase (NADP+) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   H 2 + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   H + + NADPH   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are H 2 and NADP + , whereas its two products are H + and NADPH .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on hydrogen as donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is hydrogen:NADP+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include NADP+-linked hydrogenase , NADP+-reducing hydrogenase , hydrogen dehydrogenase (NADP+) , and simply hydrogenase (which is ambiguous).  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
