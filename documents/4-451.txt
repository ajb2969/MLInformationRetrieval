   Ghost condensate      Ghost condensate   In particle physics , a ghost condensate is a speculative proposal in which a ghost , an excitation of a field with a wrong sign of the kinetic term , acquires a vacuum expectation value . This phenomenon breaks Lorentz invariance  spontaneously . Around the new vacuum state , all excitations have a positive norm, and therefore the probabilities are positive definite.  We have a real scalar field φ with the following action      S  =   ∫    d  4   x   [    a   X  2    -   b  X    ]         S       superscript  d  4   x   delimited-[]      a   superscript  X  2      b  X         S=\int d^{4}x\left[aX^{2}-bX\right]     where a and b are positive constants and       X     =  def      1  2    η   μ  ν      ∂  μ   ϕ     ∂  ν   ϕ        superscript   def   X      1  2    superscript  η    μ  ν      subscript   μ   ϕ     subscript   ν   ϕ      X\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \frac{1}{2}\eta^{\mu\nu}\partial_{\mu}\phi%
 \partial_{\nu}\phi     in the +--- sign convention .  The theories of ghost condensate predict specific non-Gaussianities of the cosmic microwave background . These theories have been proposed by Nima Arkani-Hamed , Markus Luty , and others.  Unfortunately, this theory allows for superluminal propagation of information in some cases and has no lower bound on its energy. This model doesn't admit a Hamiltonian formulation (the Legendre transform is multi-valued because the momentum function isn't convex) because it is acausal . Quantizing this theory leads to problems.  "  Category:Particle physics
