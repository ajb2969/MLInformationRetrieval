   Homoassociation      Homoassociation   In acid–base  chemistry , homoassociation (an IUPAC term) 1 is an association between a base and its conjugate acid through a hydrogen bond . The alternate term homoconjugation also has wide usage, 2 but is ambiguous because it has another meaning in organic chemistry (see Conjugated system#Mechanism ).  Most commonly, homoassociation leads to the enhancement of the acidity of an acid by itself. The effect is accentuated at high concentrations , i.e. the ionization of an acid varies nonlinearly with concentration. This effect arises from the stabilization of the conjugate base by its formation of a hydrogen bond to the parent acid. A well known case is hydrofluoric acid , which is a significantly stronger acid when concentrated than when dilute due to the following equilibria:   2 HF   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   H 2 F + + F − ( autoionization of HF )  HF + F −    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   HF 2 − (homoassociation)   Overall:   3 HF   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   HF 2 − + H 2 F +    The bifluoride anion (HF 2 − ) encourages the ionization of HF by stabilizing the F − . Thus, the usual ionization constant for hydrofluoric acid (10 −3.15 ) understates the acidity of concentrated solutions of HF.  The effect of homoassociation is often high in nonaqueous solutions , wherein dissociation is often low. Carboxylic acids and phenols exhibit this effect, 3 for example in sodium diacetate  References    "  Category:Equilibrium chemistry  Category:Acid–base chemistry     ↩  ↩  ↩
