   Unit function      Unit function   In number theory , the unit function is a completely multiplicative function on the positive integers defined as:       ε   (  n  )    =   {      1  ,       if  n   =  1        0  ,       if  n   ≠  1             ε  n    cases  1      if  n   1   0      if  n   1      \varepsilon(n)=\begin{cases}1,&\mbox{if }n=1\\
 0,&\mbox{if }n\neq 1\end{cases}     It is called the unit function because it is the identity element for Dirichlet convolution . 1  It may be described as the " indicator function of 1" within the set of positive integers. It is also written as u ( n ) (not to be confused with μ ( n )).
