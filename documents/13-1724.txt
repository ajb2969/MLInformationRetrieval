Hurwitz determinant

In mathematics, Hurwitz determinants were introduced by , who used them to give a criterion for all roots of a polynomial to have negative real part.
Definition
Let us consider a characteristic polynomial P in the variable λ of the form:



where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , are real.
The square Hurwitz matrix associated to P is given below:



The ith Hurwitz determinant is the determinant of the ith principal minor of the above Hurwitz matrix H. There are n Hurwitz determinants for a characteristic polynomial of degree n.
