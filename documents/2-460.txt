   Probability mass function      Probability mass function   In probability theory and statistics , a probability mass function ( pmf ) is a function that gives the probability that a discrete  random variable is exactly equal to some value. 1 The probability mass function is often the primary means of defining a discrete probability distribution , and such functions exist for either scalar or multivariate random variables whose domain is discrete.  A probability mass function differs from a probability density function (pdf) in that the latter is associated with continuous rather than discrete random variables; the values of the latter are not probabilities as such: a pdf must be integrated over an interval to yield a probability. 2  Formal definition  (Figure)  The probability mass function of a fair die . All the numbers on the  have an equal chance of appearing on top when the die stops rolling.   Suppose that X : S ‚Üí A (A   ‚äÜ     \subseteq    R ) is a discrete random variable defined on a sample space  S . Then the probability mass function f X : A ‚Üí [0, 1] for X is defined as 3 4         f  X    (  x  )    =   Pr   (   X  =  x   )    =   Pr   (   {   s  ‚àà  S   :    X   (  s  )    =  x   }   )     .           subscript  f  X   x    Pr    X  x          Pr   conditional-set    s  S       X  s   x        f_{X}(x)=\Pr(X=x)=\Pr(\{s\in S:X(s)=x\}).     Thinking of probability as mass helps to avoid mistakes since the physical mass is conserved as is the total probability for all hypothetical outcomes x :        ‚àë   x  ‚àà  A      f  X    (  x  )     =  1        subscript     x  A       subscript  f  X   x    1    \sum_{x\in A}f_{X}(x)=1     When there is a natural order among the hypotheses x , it may be convenient to assign numerical values to them (or n -tuples in case of a discrete multivariate random variable ) and to consider also values not in the image of X . That is, f X may be defined for all real numbers and f X ( x ) = 0 for all x    ‚àâ     \notin    X ( S ) as shown in the figure.  Since the image of X is countable , the probability mass function f X ( x ) is zero for all but a countable number of values of x . The discontinuity of probability mass functions is related to the fact that the cumulative distribution function of a discrete random variable is also discontinuous. Where it is differentiable, the derivative is zero, just as the probability mass function is zero at all such points.  Measure theoretic formulation  A probability mass function of a discrete random variable X can be seen as a special case of two more general measure theoretic constructions: the distribution of X and the probability density function of X with respect to the counting measure . We make this more precise below.  Suppose that    (  A  ,  ùíú  ,  P  )     A  ùíú  P    (A,\mathcal{A},P)   is a probability space and that    (  B  ,  ‚Ñ¨  )     B  ‚Ñ¨    (B,\mathcal{B})   is a measurable space whose underlying œÉ-algebra is discrete, so in particular contains singleton sets of B . In this setting, a random variable    X  :   A  ‚Üí  B      normal-:  X   normal-‚Üí  A  B     X\colon A\to B   is discrete provided its image is a countable set. The pushforward measure      X  *    (  P  )        subscript  X    P    X_{*}(P)   ---called a distribution of X in this context---is a probability measure on B whose restriction to singleton sets induces a probability mass function     f  X   :   B  ‚Üí  ‚Ñù      normal-:   subscript  f  X    normal-‚Üí  B  ‚Ñù     f_{X}\colon B\to\mathbb{R}   since      f  X    (  b  )    =   P   (    X   -  1     (  b  )    )    =    [    X  *    (  P  )    ]    (   {  b  }   )             subscript  f  X   b     P     superscript  X    1    b            delimited-[]     subscript  X    P     b       f_{X}(b)=P(X^{-1}(b))=[X_{*}(P)](\{b\})   for each b in B .  Now suppose that    (  B  ,  ‚Ñ¨  ,  Œº  )     B  ‚Ñ¨  Œº    (B,\mathcal{B},\mu)   is a measure space equipped with the counting measure Œº. The probability density function f of X with respect to the counting measure, if it exists, is the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the pushforward measure of X (with respect to the counting measure), so    f  =     d   X  *   P   /  d   Œº       f        d   subscript  X    P   d   Œº     f=dX_{*}P/d\mu   and f is a function from B to the non-negative reals. As a consequence, for any b in B we have      P   (  X  =  b  )   =  P   (   X   -  1     (   {  b  }   )   )   :=   ‚à´    X   -  1     (   {  b  }   )     d  P  =   ‚à´   {  b  }    f  d  Œº  =  f   (  b  )   ,     fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  X   b  normal-)    P   fragments  normal-(   superscript  X    1     fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-{  b  normal-}   normal-)   normal-)   assign   subscript      superscript  X    1     b     d  P    subscript    b    f  d  Œº   f   fragments  normal-(  b  normal-)   normal-,    P(X=b)=P(X^{-1}(\{b\})):=\int_{X^{-1}(\{b\})}dP=\int_{\{b\}}fd\mu=f(b),   demonstrating that f is in fact a probability mass function.  Examples  Suppose that S is the sample space of all outcomes of a single toss of a fair coin, and X is the random variable defined on S assigning 0 to "tails" and 1 to "heads". Since the coin is fair, the probability mass function is        f  X    (  x  )    =   {        1  2    ,      x  ;  ‚àà   {  0  ,  1  }   ,        0  ,      x  ;  ‚àâ   {  0  ,  1  }   .              subscript  f  X   x    cases    1  2    fragments  x  normal-;    fragments  normal-{  0  normal-,  1  normal-}   normal-,   0   fragments  x  normal-;    fragments  normal-{  0  normal-,  1  normal-}   normal-.      f_{X}(x)=\begin{cases}\frac{1}{2},&x;\in\{0,1\},\\
 0,&x;\notin\{0,1\}.\end{cases}   This is a special case of the binomial distribution , the Bernoulli distribution .  An example of a multivariate discrete distribution, and of its probability mass function, is provided by the multinomial distribution .  References  Further reading   Johnson, N.L., Kotz, S., Kemp A.
