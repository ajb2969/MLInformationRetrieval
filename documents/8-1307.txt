   Centrosymmetric matrix      Centrosymmetric matrix   In mathematics , especially in linear algebra and matrix theory , a centrosymmetric matrix is a matrix which is symmetric about its center. More precisely, an n × n matrix A = [ A i,j ] is centrosymmetric when its entries satisfy   A i,j = A n−i+1,n−j+1 for 1 ≤ i,j ≤ n.   If J denotes the n × n matrix with 1 on the counterdiagonal and 0 elsewhere (that is, J i,n+1-i = 1; J i,j = 0 if j ≠ n+1-i), then a matrix A is centrosymmetric if and only if AJ = JA . The matrix J is sometimes referred to as the exchange matrix .  Examples   All 2×2 centrosymmetric matrices have the form        [     a    b      b    a     ]   .      a  b    b  a     \begin{bmatrix}a&b\\
 b&a\end{bmatrix}.      All 3×3 centrosymmetric matrices have the form        [     a    b    c      d    e    d      c    b    a     ]   .      a  b  c    d  e  d    c  b  a     \begin{bmatrix}a&b&c\\
 d&e&d\\
 c&b&a\end{bmatrix}.      Symmetric  Toeplitz matrices are centrosymmetric.   Algebraic structure  If A and B are centrosymmetric matrices over a given field  K , then so are A+B and cA for any c in K . In addition, the matrix product  AB is centrosymmetric, since JAB = AJB = ABJ . Since the identity matrix is also centrosymmetric, it follows that the set of n × n centrosymmetric matrices over K is a subalgebra of the associative algebra of all n × n matrices.  Related structures  An n × n matrix A is said to be skew-centrosymmetric if its entries satisfy A i,j = - A n−i+1,n−j+1 for 1 ≤ i,j ≤ n. Equivalently, A is skew-centrosymmetric if AJ = -JA , where J is the exchange matrix defined above.  The centrosymmetric relation AJ = JA lends itself to a natural generalization, where J is replaced with an involutory matrix  K (i.e., K 2 = I ) 1  2  3 or, more generally, a matrix K satisfying K m = I for an integer m > 1 . 4  Symmetric centrosymmetric matrices are sometimes called bisymmetric matrices . When the ground field is the field of real numbers , it has been shown that bisymmetric matrices are precisely those symmetric matrices whose eigenvalues are the same up to sign after pre or post multiplication by the exchange matrix. 5 A similar result holds for Hermitian centrosymmetric and skew-centrosymmetric matrices. 6  References  Further reading      External links   Centrosymmetric matrix on MathWorld .
