Feynman slash notation

In the study of Dirac fields in quantum field theory, Richard Feynman invented the convenient Feynman slash notation (less commonly known as the Dirac slash notation1). If A is a covariant vector (i.e., a 1-form),



using the Einstein summation notation where Î³ are the gamma matrices.
Identities
Using the anticommutators of the gamma matrices, one can show that for any 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ,





 
 .
In particular,



Further identities can be read off directly from the gamma matrix identities by replacing the metric tensor with inner products. For example,













 
 .
 








where
 
 

 
  is the Levi-Civita symbol.


With four-momentum
Often, when using the Dirac equation and solving for cross sections, one finds the slash notation used on four-momentum:
using the Dirac basis for the 
 
 
 
 's,


 
  as well as the definition of four momentum



We see explicitly that



Similar results hold in other bases, such as the Weyl basis.
