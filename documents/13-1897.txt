   Sakuma–Hattori equation      Sakuma–Hattori equation   The Sakuma–Hattori equation is a mathematical model for predicting the amount of thermal radiation , radiometric flux or radiometric power emitted from a perfect blackbody or received by a thermal radiation detector.  History  The Sakuma–Hattori was first proposed by Fumihiro Sakuma, Akira Ono and Susumu Hattori in 1987. 1 In 1996 a study investigated the usefulness of various forms of the Sakuma–Hattori equation. This study showed the Planckian form to provide the best fit for most applications. 2 This study was done for 10 different forms of the Sakuma–Hattori equation containing not more than three fitting variables. In 2008, BIPM CCT-WG5 recommended its use for radiation thermometry uncertainty budgets below 960 °C. 3  General form  The Sakuma–Hattori equation gives the electromagnetic signal from thermal radiation based on an object's temperature . The signal can be electromagnetic flux or signal produced by a detector measuring this radiation. It has been suggested that below the silver point, a method using the Sakuma–Hattori equation be used. 4 In its general form it looks like: 5       S   (  T  )    =   C    exp   (    c  2     λ  x   T    )    -  1          S  T     C         subscript  c  2      subscript  λ  x   T     1      S(T)=\frac{C}{\exp\left(\frac{c_{2}}{\lambda_{x}T}\right)-1}   where:         C   C   C      Scalar coefficient         c  2     subscript  c  2    c_{2}      Second Radiation Constant (0.014387752 m⋅K 6 )         λ  x     subscript  λ  x    \lambda_{x}      Temperature dependent effective wavelength in meters        T   T   T      Temperature in Kelvin       Planckian form  Derivation  The Planckian form is realized by the following substitution:       λ  x   =   A  +   B  T         subscript  λ  x     A    B  T      \lambda_{x}=A+\frac{B}{T}     Making this substitution renders the following the Sakuma–Hattori equation in the Planckian form.      Sakuma–Hattori equation (Planckian form)        S   (  T  )    =   C    exp   (    c  2     A  T   +  B    )    -  1          S  T     C         subscript  c  2       A  T   B     1      S(T)=\frac{C}{\exp\left(\frac{c_{2}}{AT+B}\right)-1}        Inverse equation 7       T  =     c  2    A   ln   (    C  S   +  1   )      -   B  A        T       subscript  c  2     A        C  S   1        B  A      T=\frac{c_{2}}{A\ln\left(\frac{C}{S}+1\right)}-\frac{B}{A}        First derivative 8         d  S    d  T    =     [   S   (  T  )    ]   2     A   c  2     C    (    A  T   +  B   )   2      exp   (    c  2     A  T   +  B    )             d  S     d  T       superscript   delimited-[]    S  T    2       A   subscript  c  2      C   superscript      A  T   B   2          subscript  c  2       A  T   B        \frac{dS}{dT}=\left[S(T)\right]^{2}\frac{Ac_{2}}{C\left(AT+B\right)^{2}}\exp%
 \left(\frac{c_{2}}{AT+B}\right)        Discussion  The Planckian form is recommended for use in calculating uncertainty budgets for radiation thermometry 9 and infrared thermometry . 10 It is also recommended for use in calibration of radiation thermometers below the silver point. 11  The Planckian form resembles Planck's Law .       S   (  T  )    =    c  1     λ  5    [    exp   (    c  2    λ  T    )    -  1   ]           S  T      subscript  c  1      superscript  λ  5    delimited-[]         subscript  c  2     λ  T     1        S(T)=\frac{c_{1}}{\lambda^{5}\left[\exp\left(\frac{c_{2}}{\lambda T}\right)-1%
 \right]}     However the Sakuma–Hattori equation becomes very useful when considering low-temperature, wide-band radiation thermometry. To use Planck's Law over a wide spectral band, an integral like the following would have to be considered:       S   (  T  )    =    ∫   λ  1    λ  2       c  1     λ  5    [    exp   (    c  2    λ  T    )    -  1   ]     d  λ          S  T     superscript   subscript    subscript  λ  1     subscript  λ  2         subscript  c  1      superscript  λ  5    delimited-[]         subscript  c  2     λ  T     1      d  λ      S(T)=\int_{\lambda_{1}}^{\lambda_{2}}\frac{c_{1}}{\lambda^{5}\left[\exp\left(%
 \frac{c_{2}}{\lambda T}\right)-1\right]}d\lambda     This integral yields an incomplete polylogarithm function, which can make its use very cumbersome. The standard numerical treatment expands the incomplete integral in a geometric series of the exponential        ∫  0   λ  2       c  1     λ  5    [    exp   (    c  2    λ  T    )    -  1   ]     d  λ    =    c  1     (   T   c  2    )   4     ∫    c  2   /   (    λ  2   T   )    ∞      x  3     exp   (  x  )    -  1    d  x           superscript   subscript   0    subscript  λ  2         subscript  c  1      superscript  λ  5    delimited-[]         subscript  c  2     λ  T     1      d  λ       subscript  c  1    superscript    T   subscript  c  2    4     superscript   subscript      subscript  c  2      subscript  λ  2   T            superscript  x  3       x   1    d  x       \int_{0}^{\lambda_{2}}\frac{c_{1}}{\lambda^{5}[\exp(\frac{c_{2}}{\lambda T})-1%

The Sakuma–Hattori equation shown above was found to provide the best curve-fit for interpolation of scales for radiation thermometers among a number of alternatives investigated. 12  The inverse Sakuma–Hattori function can be used without iterative calculation. This is an addition advantage over integration of Planck's Law.  Other forms  The 1996 paper investigated 10 different forms. They are listed in the chart below in order of quality of curve-fit to actual radiometric data. 13      Name   Equation   Bandwidth   Planckian       Sakuma–Hattori Planck III        S   (  T  )    =   C    exp   (    c  2     A  T   +  B    )    -  1          S  T     C         subscript  c  2       A  T   B     1      S(T)=\frac{C}{\exp\left(\frac{c_{2}}{AT+B}\right)-1}      narrow   yes     Sakuma–Hattori Planck IV        S   (  T  )    =   C    exp   (    A   T  2    +   B   2  T     )    -  1          S  T     C          A   superscript  T  2      B    2  T      1      S(T)=\frac{C}{\exp\left(\frac{A}{T^{2}}+\frac{B}{2T}\right)-1}      narrow   yes     Sakuma–Hattori – Wien's II        S   (  T  )    =   C   exp   (    -   c  2      A  T   +  B    )           S  T     C         subscript  c  2        A  T   B        S(T)=C\exp\left(\frac{-c_{2}}{AT+B}\right)      narrow   no     Sakuma–Hattori Planck II        S   (  T  )    =    C   T  A      exp   (   B  T   )    -  1          S  T       C   superscript  T  A          B  T    1      S(T)=\frac{CT^{A}}{\exp\left(\frac{B}{T}\right)-1}      broad and narrow   yes     Sakuma–Hattori – Wien's I        S   (  T  )    =   C   T  A    exp   (    -  B   T   )           S  T     C   superscript  T  A         B   T       S(T)=CT^{A}{\exp\left(\frac{-B}{T}\right)}      broad and narrow   no     Sakuma–Hattori Planck I        S   (  T  )    =   C    exp   (    c  2    A  T    )    -  1          S  T     C         subscript  c  2     A  T     1      S(T)=\frac{C}{\exp\left(\frac{c_{2}}{AT}\right)-1}      monochromatic   yes     New        S   (  T  )    =    C   (   1  +   A  T    )    -  B         S  T       C    1    A  T     B     S(T)=C\left(1+\frac{A}{T}\right)-B      narrow   no     Wien's        S   (  T  )    =   C   exp   (    -   c  2     A  T    )           S  T     C         subscript  c  2      A  T        S(T)=C\exp\left(\frac{-c_{2}}{AT}\right)      monochromatic   no     Effective Wavelength – Wien's        S   (  T  )    =   C   exp   (     -  A   T   +   B   T  2     )           S  T     C          A   T     B   superscript  T  2         S(T)=C\exp\left(\frac{-A}{T}+\frac{B}{T^{2}}\right)      narrow   no     Exponent        S   (  T  )    =   C   T  A          S  T     C   superscript  T  A      S(T)=CT^{A}      broad   no     See also   Stefan–Boltzmann law  Planck's law  Rayleigh–Jeans law  Wien approximation  Wien's displacement law  Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation    Infrared thermometer  Pyrometer  Thin filament pyrometry  Thermography    Black body  Thermal radiation  Radiance  Emissivity    ASTM Subcommittee E20.02 on Radiation Thermometry   Notes  References    "  Category:Statistical mechanics  Category:Equations        F Sakuma, S Hattori, "Establishing a practical temperature standard by using a narrow-band radiation thermometer with a silicon detector", in Temperature: Its Measurement and Control in Science and Industry , vol. 5, edited by J F Schooley, New York, AIP, 421–427 (1982). ↩  J.
