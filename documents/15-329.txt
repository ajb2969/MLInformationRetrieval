Fundamental increment lemma

In single-variable differential calculus, the fundamental increment lemma is an immediate consequence of the definition of the derivative f{{'}}(a) of a function f at a point a:


 
  The lemma asserts that the existence of this derivative implies the existence of a function 
 
 
 
  such that


 
  for sufficiently small but non-zero h. For a proof, it suffices to define


 
  and verify this 
 
 
 
  meets the requirements.
Differentiability in higher dimensions
In that the existence of 
 
 
 
  uniquely characterises the number 
 
 
 
 , the fundamental increment lemma can be said to characterise the differentiability of single-variable functions. For this reason, a generalisation of the lemma can be used in the definition of differentiability in multivariable calculus. In particular, suppose f maps some subset of 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . Then f is said to be differentiable at a if there is a linear function


 
  and a function


 
  such that


 
  for non-zero h sufficiently close to 0. In this case, M is the unique derivative (or total derivative, to distinguish from the directional and partial derivatives) of f at a. Notably, M is given by the Jacobian matrix of f evaluated at a.
