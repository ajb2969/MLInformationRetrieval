   Fundamental increment lemma      Fundamental increment lemma   In single-variable differential calculus , the fundamental increment lemma is an immediate consequence of the definition of the derivative  f {{'}}( a ) of a function  f at a point a :         f  ′    (  a  )    =    lim   h  →  0       f   (   a  +  h   )    -   f   (  a  )     h     .         superscript  f  normal-′   a     subscript    normal-→  h  0          f    a  h      f  a    h      f^{\prime}(a)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.   The lemma asserts that the existence of this derivative implies the existence of a function   φ   φ   \varphi   such that         lim   h  →  0     φ   (  h  )     =   0  and      f   (   a  +  h   )    =    f   (  a  )    +    f  ′    (  a  )   h   +   φ   (  h  )   h        formulae-sequence      subscript    normal-→  h  0      φ  h     0  and        f    a  h        f  a      superscript  f  normal-′   a  h     φ  h  h       \lim_{h\to 0}\varphi(h)=0\qquad\text{and}\qquad f(a+h)=f(a)+f^{\prime}(a)h+%
 \varphi(h)h   for sufficiently small but non-zero h . For a proof, it suffices to define       φ   (  h  )    =      f   (   a  +  h   )    -   f   (  a  )     h   -    f  ′    (  a  )           φ  h           f    a  h      f  a    h      superscript  f  normal-′   a      \varphi(h)=\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}-f^{\prime}(a)   and verify this   φ   φ   \varphi   meets the requirements.  Differentiability in higher dimensions  In that the existence of   φ   φ   \varphi   uniquely characterises the number     f  ′    (  a  )        superscript  f  normal-′   a    f^{\prime}(a)   , the fundamental increment lemma can be said to characterise the differentiability of single-variable functions. For this reason, a generalisation of the lemma can be used in the definition of differentiability in multivariable calculus . In particular, suppose f maps some subset of    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   to   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   . Then f is said to be differentiable at a if there is a linear function      M  :    ℝ  n   →  ℝ      normal-:  M   normal-→   superscript  ℝ  n   ℝ     M:\mathbb{R}^{n}\to\mathbb{R}   and a function       Φ  :    D  →  ℝ   ,   D  ⊆    ℝ  n   ∖   {  𝟘  }       ,     normal-:  normal-Φ   formulae-sequence   normal-→  D  ℝ     D     superscript  ℝ  n    0        \Phi:D\to\mathbb{R},\qquad D\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}\smallsetminus\{\mathbb{0}\},   such that         lim   𝕙  →  0     Φ   (  𝕙  )     =   0  and      f   (   𝕒  +  𝕙   )    =    f   (  𝕒  )    +   M   (  𝕙  )    +    Φ   (  𝕙  )    ⋅   ∥  𝕙  ∥         formulae-sequence      subscript    normal-→  𝕙  0      normal-Φ  𝕙     0  and        f    𝕒  𝕙        f  𝕒     M  𝕙    normal-⋅    normal-Φ  𝕙    norm  𝕙        \lim_{\mathbb{h}\to 0}\Phi(\mathbb{h})=0\qquad\text{and}\qquad f(\mathbb{a}+%
 \mathbb{h})=f(\mathbb{a})+M(\mathbb{h})+\Phi(\mathbb{h})\cdot\|\mathbb{h}\|   for non-zero h sufficiently close to 0 . In this case, M is the unique derivative (or total derivative , to distinguish from the directional and partial derivatives ) of f at a . Notably, M is given by the Jacobian matrix of f evaluated at a .  See also   Generalizations of the derivative   References      "  Category:Differential calculus
