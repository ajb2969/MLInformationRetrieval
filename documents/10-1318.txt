   Pyruvate oxidase (CoA-acetylating)      Pyruvate oxidase (CoA-acetylating)   In enzymology , a pyruvate oxidase (CoA-acetylating) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   pyruvate + CoA + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetyl-CoA + CO 2 + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are pyruvate , CoA , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are acetyl-CoA , CO 2 , and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is pyruvate:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase (CoA-acetylating) . This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism . It employs one cofactor , FAD .
