   Homoglutathione synthase      Homoglutathione synthase   In enzymology , a homoglutathione synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + gamma-L-glutamyl-L-cysteine + beta-alanine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + gamma-L-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl-beta-alanine   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , gamma-L-glutamyl-L-cysteine , and beta-alanine , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and gamma-L-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl-beta-alanine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds as acid-D-amino-acid ligases (peptide synthases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is gamma-L-glutamyl-L-cysteine:beta-alanine ligase (ADP-forming) . Other names in common use include homoglutathione synthetase , and beta-alanine specific hGSH synthetase .  References     "  Category:EC 6.3.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
