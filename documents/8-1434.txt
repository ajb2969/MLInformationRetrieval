   Stopped process      Stopped process   In mathematics , a stopped process is a stochastic process that is forced to assume the same value after a prescribed (possibly random) time.  Definition  Let       (  Ω  ,  ℱ  ,  ℙ  )     normal-Ω  ℱ  ℙ    (\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})   be a probability space ;      (  𝕏  ,  𝒜  )     𝕏  𝒜    (\mathbb{X},\mathcal{A})   be a measurable space ;      X  :     [  0  ,   +  ∞   )   ×  Ω   →  𝕏      normal-:  X   normal-→     0       normal-Ω   𝕏     X:[0,+\infty)\times\Omega\to\mathbb{X}   be a stochastic process;      τ  :   Ω  →   [  0  ,   +  ∞   ]       normal-:  τ   normal-→  normal-Ω   0          \tau:\Omega\to[0,+\infty]   be a stopping time with respect to some filtration     {   ℱ  t   |   t  ≥  0   }     conditional-set   subscript  ℱ  t     t  0     \{\mathcal{F}_{t}|t\geq 0\}   of   ℱ   ℱ   {}\mathcal{F}   .   Then the stopped process     X  τ     superscript  X  τ    X^{\tau}   is defined for    t  ≥  0      t  0    t\geq 0   and    ω  ∈  Ω      ω  normal-Ω    \omega\in\Omega   by         X  t  τ    (  ω  )    :=    X   min   {  t  ,   τ   (  ω  )    }      (  ω  )     .     assign     superscript   subscript  X  t   τ   ω      subscript  X    t    τ  ω     ω     X_{t}^{\tau}(\omega):=X_{\min\{t,\tau(\omega)\}}(\omega).     Examples  Gambling  Consider a gambler playing roulette . X t denotes the gambler's total holdings in the casino at time t ≥ 0, which may or may not be allowed to be negative, depending on whether or not the casino offers credit. Let Y t denote what the gambler's holdings would be if he/she could obtain unlimited credit (so Y can attain negative values).   Stopping at a deterministic time: suppose that the casino is prepared to lend the gambler unlimited credit, and that the gambler resolves to leave the game at a predetermined time T , regardless of the state of play. Then X is really the stopped process Y T , since the gambler's account remains in the same state after leaving the game as it was in at the moment that the gambler left the game.    Stopping at a random time: suppose that the gambler has no other sources of revenue, and that the casino will not extend its customers credit. The gambler resolves to play until and unless he/she goes broke. Then the random time        τ   (  ω  )    :=   inf   {   t  ≥  0   |     Y  t    (  ω  )    =  0   }       assign    τ  ω    infimum   conditional-set    t  0        subscript  Y  t   ω   0       \tau(\omega):=\inf\{t\geq 0|Y_{t}(\omega)=0\}     is a stopping time for Y , and, since the gambler cannot continue to play after he/she has exhausted his/her resources, X is the stopped process Y τ .  Brownian motion  Let    B  :     [  0  ,   +  ∞   )   ×  Ω   →  ℝ      normal-:  B   normal-→     0       normal-Ω   ℝ     B:[0,+\infty)\times\Omega\to\mathbb{R}   be a one-dimensional standard Brownian motion starting at zero.   Stopping at a deterministic time    T  >  0      T  0    T>0   : if     τ   (  ω  )    ≡  T        τ  ω   T    \tau(\omega)\equiv T   , then the stopped Brownian motion    B  τ     superscript  B  τ    B^{\tau}   will evolve as per usual up until time   T   T   T   , and thereafter will stay constant: i.e.,      B  t  τ    (  ω  )    ≡    B  T    (  ω  )           superscript   subscript  B  t   τ   ω      subscript  B  T   ω     B_{t}^{\tau}(\omega)\equiv B_{T}(\omega)   for all    t  ≥  T      t  T    t\geq T   .    Stopping at a random time: define a random stopping time   τ   τ   \tau   by the first hitting time for the region    {   x  ∈  ℝ   |   x  ≥  a   }     conditional-set    x  ℝ     x  a     \{x\in\mathbb{R}|x\geq a\}   :           τ   (  ω  )    :=   inf   {   t  >  0   |     B  t    (  ω  )    ≥  a   }     .     assign    τ  ω    infimum   conditional-set    t  0        subscript  B  t   ω   a       \tau(\omega):=\inf\{t>0|B_{t}(\omega)\geq a\}.        Then the stopped Brownian motion    B  τ     superscript  B  τ    B^{\tau}   will evolve as per usual up until the random time   τ   τ   \tau   , and will thereafter be constant with value   a   a   a   : i.e.,      B  t  τ    (  ω  )    ≡  a         superscript   subscript  B  t   τ   ω   a    B_{t}^{\tau}(\omega)\equiv a   for all    t  ≥   τ   (  ω  )        t    τ  ω     t\geq\tau(\omega)   .
