Streptomycin-6-phosphatase




Streptomycin-6-phosphatase

In enzymology, a streptomycin-6-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

streptomycin 6-phosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  streptomycin + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are streptomycin 6-phosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are streptomycin and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is streptomycin-6-phosphate phosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include streptomycin 6-phosphate phosphatase, streptomycin 6-phosphate phosphohydrolase, and streptomycin-6-P phosphohydrolase. This enzyme participates in streptomycin biosynthesis.
