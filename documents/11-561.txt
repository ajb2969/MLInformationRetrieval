   Streptomycin-6-phosphatase      Streptomycin-6-phosphatase   In enzymology , a streptomycin-6-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   streptomycin 6-phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   streptomycin + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are streptomycin 6-phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are streptomycin and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is streptomycin-6-phosphate phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include streptomycin 6-phosphate phosphatase , streptomycin 6-phosphate phosphohydrolase , and streptomycin-6-P phosphohydrolase . This enzyme participates in streptomycin biosynthesis .  References      "  Category:EC 3.1.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
