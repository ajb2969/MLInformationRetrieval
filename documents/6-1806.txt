   Degree of a continuous mapping      Degree of a continuous mapping   In topology , the degree of a continuous mapping between two compact  oriented  manifolds of the same dimension is a number that represents the number of times that the domain manifold wraps around the range manifold under the mapping. The degree is always an integer , but may be positive or negative depending on the orientations.  The degree of a map was first defined by Brouwer , 1 who showed that the degree is homotopy invariant ( invariant among homotopies), and used it to prove the Brouwer fixed point theorem . In modern mathematics, the degree of a map plays an important role in topology and geometry . In physics , the degree of a continuous map (for instance a map from space to some order parameter set) is one example of a topological quantum number .  Definitions of the degree  From S n to S n  The simplest and most important case is the degree of a continuous map from the    n   n   n   -sphere     S  n     superscript  S  n    S^{n}   to itself (in the case    n  =  1      n  1    n=1   , this is called the winding number ):  Let    f  :    S  n   ‚Üí   S  n       normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí   superscript  S  n    superscript  S  n      f\colon S^{n}\to S^{n}   be a continuous map. Then   f   f   f   induces a homomorphism     f  *   :     H  n    (   S  n   )    ‚Üí    H  n    (   S  n   )        normal-:   subscript  f     normal-‚Üí     subscript  H  n    superscript  S  n       subscript  H  n    superscript  S  n       f_{*}\colon H_{n}\left(S^{n}\right)\to H_{n}\left(S^{n}\right)   , where     H  n    (  ‚ãÖ  )        subscript  H  n   normal-‚ãÖ    H_{n}\left(\cdot\right)   is the   n   n   n   th homology group . Considering the fact that      H  n    (   S  n   )    ‚âÖ  ‚Ñ§         subscript  H  n    superscript  S  n    ‚Ñ§    H_{n}\left(S^{n}\right)\cong\mathbb{Z}   , we see that    f  *     subscript  f     f_{*}   must be of the form     f  *   :   x  ‚Ü¶   Œ±  x       normal-:   subscript  f     maps-to  x    Œ±  x      f_{*}\colon x\mapsto\alpha x   for some fixed    Œ±  ‚àà  ‚Ñ§      Œ±  ‚Ñ§    \alpha\in\mathbb{Z}   . This   Œ±   Œ±   \alpha   is then called the degree of   f   f   f   .  Between manifolds  Algebraic topology  Let X and Y be closed connected  oriented  m -dimensional manifolds . Orientability of a manifold implies that its top homology group is isomorphic to Z . Choosing an orientation means choosing a generator of the top homology group.  A continuous map f : X ‚Üí Y induces a homomorphism f * from H m ( X ) to H m ( Y ). Let [ X ], resp. [ Y ] be the chosen generator of H m ( X ), resp. H m ( Y ) (or the fundamental class of X , Y ). Then the degree of f is defined to be f * ([ X ]). In other words,         f  *    (   [  X  ]   )    =    deg   (  f  )     [  Y  ]     .         subscript  f     delimited-[]  X       degree  f    delimited-[]  Y      f_{*}([X])=\deg(f)[Y]\,.     If y in Y and f  ‚àí1 ( y ) is a finite set, the degree of f can be computed by considering the m -th local homology groups of X at each point in f  ‚àí1 ( y ).  Differential topology  In the language of differential topology, the degree of a smooth map can be defined as follows: If f is a smooth map whose domain is a compact manifold and p is a regular value of f , consider the finite set         f   -  1     (  p  )    =   {   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x  n   }    .         superscript  f    1    p     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  n      f^{-1}(p)=\{x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}\}\,.     By p being a regular value, in a neighborhood of each x i the map f is a local diffeomorphism (it is a covering map ). Diffeomorphisms can be either orientation preserving or orientation reversing. Let r be the number of points x i at which f is orientation preserving and s be the number at which f is orientation reversing. When the domain of f is connected, the number r ‚àí s is independent of the choice of p (though n is not!) and one defines the degree of f to be r ‚àí s . This definition coincides with the algebraic topological definition above.  The same definition works for compact manifolds with boundary but then f should send the boundary of X to the boundary of Y .  One can also define degree modulo 2 (deg 2 ( f )) the same way as before but taking the fundamental class in Z 2 homology. In this case deg 2 ( f ) is an element of Z 2 (the field with two elements ), the manifolds need not be orientable and if n is the number of preimages of p as before then deg 2 ( f ) is n modulo 2.  Integration of differential forms gives a pairing between (C ‚àû -) singular homology and de Rham cohomology :  = ‚à´ c œâ , where [ c ] is a homology class represented by a cycle c and œâ a closed form representing a de Rham cohomology class. For a smooth map f : X ‚Üí Y between orientable m -manifolds, one has        ‚ü®    f  *    [  c  ]    ,   [  œâ  ]   ‚ü©   =   ‚ü®   [  c  ]   ,    f  *    [  œâ  ]    ‚ü©    ,          subscript  f     delimited-[]  c     delimited-[]  œâ      delimited-[]  c      superscript  f     delimited-[]  œâ       \langle f_{*}[c],[\omega]\rangle=\langle[c],f^{*}[\omega]\rangle,     where f * and f * are induced maps on chains and forms respectively. Since f * [ X ] = deg f ¬∑ [ Y ], we have        deg  f     ‚à´  Y   œâ    =    ‚à´  X     f  *    œâ            degree  f     subscript   Y   œâ      subscript   X      superscript  f    œâ      \deg f\int_{Y}\omega=\int_{X}f^{*}\omega\,     for any m -form œâ on Y .  Maps from closed region  If    Œ©  ‚äÇ    \R   n       normal-Œ©   superscript  \R  n     \Omega\subset\R^{n}   is a bounded region ,    f  :    Œ©  ¬Ø   ‚Üí    \R   n       normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí   normal-¬Ø  normal-Œ©    superscript  \R  n      f:\bar{\Omega}\to\R^{n}   smooth,   p   p   p   a regular value of   f   f   f   and    p  ‚àâ   f   (   ‚àÇ  Œ©   )        p    f    normal-Œ©      p\notin f(\partial\Omega)   , then the degree    deg   (  f  ,  Œ©  ,  p  )      degree  f  normal-Œ©  p    \deg(f,\Omega,p)   is defined by the formula       deg   (  f  ,  Œ©  ,  p  )    :=    ‚àë   y  ‚àà    f   -  1     (  p  )       sgn   det   D  f   (  y  )          assign   degree  f  normal-Œ©  p     subscript     y     superscript  f    1    p       sgn      D  f  y        \deg(f,\Omega,p):=\sum_{y\in f^{-1}(p)}\operatorname{sgn}\det Df(y)   where    D  f   (  y  )       D  f  y    Df(y)   is the Jacobi matrix of   f   f   f   in   y   y   y   . This definition of the degree may be naturally extended for non-regular values   p   p   p   such that     deg   (  f  ,  Œ©  ,  p  )    =   deg   (  f  ,  Œ©  ,   p  ‚Ä≤   )         degree  f  normal-Œ©  p    degree  f  normal-Œ©   superscript  p  normal-‚Ä≤      \deg(f,\Omega,p)=\deg(f,\Omega,p^{\prime})   where    p  ‚Ä≤     superscript  p  normal-‚Ä≤    p^{\prime}   is a point close to   p   p   p   .  The degree satisfies the following properties: 2   If     deg   (  f  ,   Œ©  ¬Ø   ,  p  )    ‚â†  0       degree  f   normal-¬Ø  normal-Œ©   p   0    \deg(f,\bar{\Omega},p)\neq 0   , then there exists    x  ‚àà  Œ©      x  normal-Œ©    x\in\Omega   such that     f   (  x  )    =  p        f  x   p    f(x)=p   .       deg   (  id  ,  Œ©  ,  y  )    =  1       degree  id  normal-Œ©  y   1    \deg(\operatorname{id},\Omega,y)=1   for all    y  ‚àà  Œ©      y  normal-Œ©    y\in\Omega   .  Decomposition property:        deg   (  f  ,  Œ©  ,  y  )    =    deg   (  f  ,   Œ©  1   ,  y  )    +   deg   (  f  ,   Œ©  2   ,  y  )          degree  f  normal-Œ©  y      degree  f   subscript  normal-Œ©  1   y    degree  f   subscript  normal-Œ©  2   y      \deg(f,\Omega,y)=\deg(f,\Omega_{1},y)+\deg(f,\Omega_{2},y)   , if     Œ©  1   ,   Œ©  2       subscript  normal-Œ©  1    subscript  normal-Œ©  2     \Omega_{1},\Omega_{2}   are disjoint parts of    Œ©  =    Œ©  1   ‚à™   Œ©  2        normal-Œ©     subscript  normal-Œ©  1    subscript  normal-Œ©  2      \Omega=\Omega_{1}\cup\Omega_{2}   and    y  ‚àâ   f   (    Œ©  ¬Ø   ‚àñ   (    Œ©  1   ‚à™   Œ©  2    )    )        y    f     normal-¬Ø  normal-Œ©      subscript  normal-Œ©  1    subscript  normal-Œ©  2        y\not\in f(\overline{\Omega}\setminus(\Omega_{1}\cup\Omega_{2}))   .   Homotopy invariance : If   f   f   f   and   g   g   g   are homotopy equivalent via a homotopy    F   (  t  )       F  t    F(t)   such that      F   (  0  )    =  f   ,    F   (  1  )    =  g      formulae-sequence      F  0   f       F  1   g     F(0)=f,\,F(1)=g   and    p  ‚àâ   F   (  t  )    (   ‚àÇ  Œ©   )        p    F  t    normal-Œ©      p\notin F(t)(\partial\Omega)   , then     deg   (  f  ,  Œ©  ,  p  )    =   deg   (  g  ,  Œ©  ,  p  )         degree  f  normal-Œ©  p    degree  g  normal-Œ©  p     \deg(f,\Omega,p)=\deg(g,\Omega,p)     The function    p  ‚Ü¶   deg   (  f  ,  Œ©  ,  p  )       maps-to  p   degree  f  normal-Œ©  p     p\mapsto\deg(f,\Omega,p)   is locally constant on      \R   n   -   f   (   ‚àÇ  Œ©   )         superscript  \R  n     f    normal-Œ©      \R^{n}-f(\partial\Omega)      These properties characterise the degree uniquely and the degree may be defined by them in an axiomatic way.  In a similar way, we could define the degree of a map between compact oriented manifolds with boundary .  Properties  The degree of a map is a homotopy invariant; moreover for continuous maps from the sphere to itself it is a complete homotopy invariant, i.e. two maps     f  ,  g   :    S  n   ‚Üí    S  n        normal-:   f  g    normal-‚Üí   superscript  S  n    superscript  S  n      f,g:S^{n}\to S^{n}\,   are homotopic if and only if     deg   (  f  )    =   deg   (  g  )         degree  f    degree  g     \deg(f)=\deg(g)   .  In other words, degree is an isomorphism     [   S  n   ,   S  n   ]   =    œÄ  n    S  n    ‚Üí  ùêô          superscript  S  n    superscript  S  n       subscript  œÄ  n    superscript  S  n      normal-‚Üí    ùêô     [S^{n},S^{n}]=\pi_{n}S^{n}\to\mathbf{Z}   .  Moreover, the Hopf theorem states that for any   n   n   n   closed oriented manifold  M , two maps     f  ,  g   :   M  ‚Üí   S  n       normal-:   f  g    normal-‚Üí  M   superscript  S  n      f,g:M\to S^{n}   are homotopic if and only if      deg   (  f  )    =   deg   (  g  )     .       degree  f    degree  g     \deg(f)=\deg(g).     A self-map    f  :    S  n   ‚Üí   S  n       normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí   superscript  S  n    superscript  S  n      f:S^{n}\to S^{n}   of the n -sphere is extendable to a map    F  :    B  n   ‚Üí   S  n       normal-:  F   normal-‚Üí   subscript  B  n    superscript  S  n      F:B_{n}\to S^{n}   from the n -ball to the n -sphere if and only if     deg   (  f  )    =  0       degree  f   0    \deg(f)=0   . (Here the function F extends f in the sense that f is the restriction of F to    S  n     superscript  S  n    S^{n}   .)
