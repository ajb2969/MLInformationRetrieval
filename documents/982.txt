It was named by Alfred Young in 1930. Groups of this type are identified by a parameter n , the dimension of the hypercube.  As a Coxeter group it is of type B n = C n , and as a Weyl group it is associated to the orthogonal groups in odd dimensions. As a wreath product it is     S  2   ≀   S  n      normal-≀   subscript  S  2    subscript  S  n     S_{2}\wr S_{n}   where    S  n     subscript  S  n    S_{n}   is the symmetric group of degree n . As a permutation group , the group is the signed symmetric group of permutations π either of the set { − n , − n + 1, ..., −1, 1, 2, ..., n } or of the set { − n , − n + 1, ..., n } such that π ( i ) = − π (− i ) for all i . As a matrix group , it can be described as the group of n × n  orthogonal matrices whose entries are all integers . The representation theory of the hyperoctahedral group was described by  according to .  In three dimensions, the hyperoctahedral group is known as O × S 2 where O ≅ S 4 is the octahedral group , and S 2 is a symmetric group (equivalently, cyclic group ) of order 2. Geometric figures in three dimensions with this symmetry group are said to have octahedral symmetry . In two dimensions, the hyperoctahedral group is known as the dihedral group of order eight , describing the symmetry of a square.  By dimension  Hyperoctahedral groups can be named as BC n , a bracket notation, or as a Coxeter group graph:      n   Symmetry group   BC n   Coxeter notation   Order   Mirrors   Structure   Related regular polytopes       2   D 4 (*4•)   BC 2   [4]    2 2 2! = 8   2       D  i   h  4       D  i   subscript  h  4     Dih_{4}        ≅    S  2   ≀   S  2        absent   normal-≀   subscript  S  2    subscript  S  2      \cong S_{2}\wr S_{2}        3   O h ( *432 )   BC 3   [4,3]    2 3 3! = 48   3+6        S  4   ×   S  2        subscript  S  4    subscript  S  2     S_{4}\times S_{2}        ≅    S  2   ≀   S  3        absent   normal-≀   subscript  S  2    subscript  S  3      \cong S_{2}\wr S_{3}        4   ± 1 / 6 [OxO].2 1 (O/V;O/V) *  2   BC 4   [4,3,3]    2 4 4! = 384   4+12        S  2   ≀   S  4      normal-≀   subscript  S  2    subscript  S  4     S_{2}\wr S_{4}        5      BC 5   [4,3,3,3]    2 5 5! = 3840   5+20        S  2   ≀   S  5      normal-≀   subscript  S  2    subscript  S  5     S_{2}\wr S_{5}        6      BC 6   [4,3 4 ]    2 6 6! = 46080   6+30        S  2   ≀   S  6      normal-≀   subscript  S  2    subscript  S  6     S_{2}\wr S_{6}        ...     n      BC n   [4,3 n-2 ]   ...   2 n n ! = [[double factorial|(2 n )   ]]   n 2     Subgroups  There is a notable index two subgroup, corresponding to the Coxeter group D n and the symmetries of the demihypercube . Viewed as a wreath product, there are two natural maps from the hyperoctahedral group to the cyclic group of order 2: one map coming from "multiply the signs of all the elements" (in the n copies of    {   ±  1   }      plus-or-minus  1     \{\pm 1\}   ), and one map coming from the parity of the permutation. Multiplying these together yields a third map     C  n   →   {   ±  1   }      normal-→   subscript  C  n     plus-or-minus  1      C_{n}\to\{\pm 1\}   . The kernel of the first map is the Coxeter group     D  n   .     subscript  D  n    D_{n}.   In terms of signed permutations , thought of as matrices, this third map is simply the determinant, while the first two correspond to "multiplying the non-zero entries" and "parity of the underlying (unsigned) permutation", which are not generally meaningful for matrices, but are in the case due to the coincidence with a wreath product.  The kernels of these three maps are all three index two subgroups of the hyperoctahedral group, as discussed in H 1 : Abelianization below, and their intersection is the derived subgroup , of index 4 (quotient the Klein 4-group), which corresponds to the rotational symmetries of the demihypercube.  In the other direction, the center is the subgroup of scalar matrices, {±1}; geometrically, quotienting out by this corresponds to passing to the projective orthogonal group .  In dimension 2 these groups completely describe the hyperoctahedral group, which is the dihedral group Dih 4 of order 8 , and is an extension 2.V (of the 4-group by a cyclic group of order 2). In general, passing to the subquotient (derived subgroup, mod center) is the symmetry group of the projective demihypercube.

H 1 : abelianization  The first homology group, which agrees with the abelianization , stabilizes at the Klein four-group , and is given by:         H  1    (   C  n   ,  𝐙  )    =   {     0     n  =  0        𝐙  /  2      n  =  1          𝐙  /  2   ×  𝐙   /  2      n  ≥  2        .         subscript  H  1     subscript  C  n   𝐙     cases  0    n  0     𝐙  2     n  1         𝐙  2   𝐙   2     n  2      H_{1}(C_{n},\mathbf{Z})=\begin{cases}0&n=0\\
 \mathbf{Z}/2&n=1\\
 \mathbf{Z}/2\times\mathbf{Z}/2&n\geq 2\end{cases}.   This is easily seen directly: the    -  1      1    -1   elements are order 2 (which is non-empty for    n  ≥  1      n  1    n\geq 1   ), and all conjugate, as are the transpositions in    S  n     subscript  S  n    S_{n}   (which is non-empty for    n  ≥  2      n  2    n\geq 2   ), and these are two separate classes. These elements generate the group, so the only non-trivial abelianizations are to 2-groups, and either of these classes can be sent independently to      -  1   ∈   {   ±  1   }    ,        1     plus-or-minus  1      -1\in\{\pm 1\},   as they are two separate classes. The maps are explicitly given as "the product of the signs of all the elements" (in the n copies of    {   ±  1   }      plus-or-minus  1     \{\pm 1\}   ), and the sign of the permutation. Multiplying these together yields a third non-trivial map (the determinant of the matrix, which sends both these classes to    -  1      1    -1   ), and together with the trivial map these form the 4-group.  H 2 : Schur multipliers  The second homology groups, known classically as the Schur multipliers , were computed in .  They are:         H  2    (   C  n   ,  𝐙  )    =   {     0     n  =   0  ,  1         𝐙  /  2      n  =  2         (   𝐙  /  2   )   2      n  =  3         (   𝐙  /  2   )   3      n  ≥  4        .         subscript  H  2     subscript  C  n   𝐙     cases  0    n   0  1      𝐙  2     n  2    superscript    𝐙  2   2     n  3    superscript    𝐙  2   3     n  4      H_{2}(C_{n},\mathbf{Z})=\begin{cases}0&n=0,1\\
 \mathbf{Z}/2&n=2\\
 (\mathbf{Z}/2)^{2}&n=3\\
 (\mathbf{Z}/2)^{3}&n\geq 4\end{cases}.     Notes  References   Patrick du Val , Homographies, Quaternions and Rotations (1964)  John Horton Conway , On Quaternions and Octonions (2003)      H.S.M.
