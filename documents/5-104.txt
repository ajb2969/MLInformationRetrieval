Betatron

  A betatron is a cyclic particle accelerator developed by Donald Kerst at the University of Illinois in 1940 to accelerate electrons,123 but the concepts ultimately originate from Rolf Widerøe,45 whose development of an induction accelerator failed due to the lack of transverse focusing.6 Previous development in Germany also occurred through Max Steenbeck in the 1940s.7
The betatron is essentially a transformer with a torus-shaped vacuum tube as its secondary coil. An alternating current in the primary coils accelerates electrons in the vacuum around a circular path. The betatron was the first important machine for producing high energy electrons.
Operation principle
In a betatron, the changing magnetic field from the primary coil accelerates electrons injected into the vacuum torus, causing them to circle round the torus in the same manner as current is induced in the secondary coil of a transformer (Faraday's Law).
The stable orbit for the electrons satisfies

  is the flux within the area enclosed by the electron orbit,


 
  is the radius of the electron orbit, and


 
  is the magnetic field at 
 
 
 
 .
In other words, the magnetic field at the orbit must be half the average magnetic field over its circular cross section:



This condition is often called Widerøe's condition.8
Etymology
The name "betatron" (a reference to the beta particle, a fast electron) was chosen during a departmental contest. Other proposals were "rheotron", "induction accelerator", "induction electron accelerator",9 and even "Außerordentlichhochgeschwindigkeitelektronenentwickelndenschwerarbeitsbeigollitron", a suggestion by a German associate, for "Hard working by golly machine for generating extraordinarily high velocity electrons"1011 or perhaps "Extraordinarily high velocity electron generator, high energy by golly-tron."12
Applications
Betatrons were historically employed in particle physics experiments to provide high energy beams of electrons—up to about 300 MeV. If the electron beam is directed at a metal plate, the betatron can be used as a source of energetic x-rays or gamma rays; these x-rays may be used in industrial and medical applications (historically in radiation oncology). A small version of a Betatron was also used to provide electrons converted into hard X-rays by a target to provide prompt initiation of some experimental nuclear weapons by means of photon-induced fission and photon->neutron reactions in the bomb core.131415
The Radiation Center, the first private medical center to treat cancer patients with a betatron, was opened by Dr. O. Arthur Stiennon in a suburb of Madison, Wisconsin in the late 1950s.16
Limitations
The maximum energy that betatron can impart is limited by the strength of the magnetic field due to the saturation of iron and by practical size of the magnet core. The next generation of accelerators, the synchrotrons, overcame these limitations.
In popular culture

Theoretical physicist Michio Kaku said he tried to build a betatron in his garage while still in high school.17
