<h1>Ludwig Stickelberger</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Ludwig Stickelberger</strong> (May 18, 1850 – April 11, 1936) was a <a class="uri" href="Swiss" title="wikilink">Swiss</a> <a class="uri" href="mathematician" title="wikilink">mathematician</a> who made important contributions to <a href="linear_algebra" title="wikilink">linear algebra</a> (theory of <a href="elementary_divisors" title="wikilink">elementary divisors</a>) and <a href="algebraic_number_theory" title="wikilink">algebraic number theory</a> (Stickelberger relation in the theory of <a href="cyclotomic_field" title="wikilink">cyclotomic fields</a>).</p>
<h2 id="short-biography">Short biography</h2>

<p>Stickelberger was born in Buch in the <a href="canton_of_Schaffhausen" title="wikilink">canton of Schaffhausen</a> into a family of a pastor. He graduated from a gymnasium in 1867 and studied next in the <a href="University_of_Heidelberg" title="wikilink">University of Heidelberg</a>. In 1874 he received a doctorate in <a class="uri" href="Berlin" title="wikilink">Berlin</a> under the direction of <a href="Karl_Weierstrass" title="wikilink">Karl Weierstrass</a> for his work on transformation of <a href="quadratic_form" title="wikilink">quadratic forms</a> to a diagonal form. In the same year he obtained his <a class="uri" href="Habilitation" title="wikilink">Habilitation</a> from Polytechnicum in <a class="uri" href="Zurich" title="wikilink">Zurich</a> (now <a href="ETH_Zurich" title="wikilink">ETH Zurich</a>). In 1879 he became an extraordinary professor in the <a href="University_of_Freiburg" title="wikilink">Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg</a>. From 1896 to 1919 he worked there as a full professor, and from 1919 until his return to Basel in 1924 he held the title of a distinguished professor ("ordentlicher Honorarprofessor"). He was married in 1895, but his wife and son both died in 1918. Stickelberger died on April 11, 1936 and was buried next to his wife and son in Freiburg.</p>
<h2 id="mathematical-contributions">Mathematical contributions</h2>

<p>Stickelberger's obituary lists the total of 14 publications: his thesis (in Latin), 8 further papers that he authored which appeared during his lifetime, 4 joint papers with <a href="Georg_Frobenius" title="wikilink">Georg Frobenius</a> and a posthumously published paper written circa 1915. Despite this modest output, he is characterized there as "one of the sharpest among the pupils of Weierstrass" and a "mathematician of a high rank". Stickelberger's thesis and several later papers streamline and complete earlier investigations of various authors, in a direct and elegant way.</p>
<h3 id="linear-algebra">Linear algebra</h3>

<p>Stickelberger's work on the classification of pairs of bilinear and quadratic forms filled in important gaps in the theory earlier developed by Weierstrass and <a href="Gaston_Darboux" title="wikilink">Darboux</a>. Augmented with the contemporaneous work of Frobenius, it set the theory of <a href="elementary_divisors" title="wikilink">elementary divisors</a> upon a rigorous foundation. An important 1878 paper of Stickelberger and Frobenius gave the first complete treatment of the <a href="classification_of_finitely_generated_abelian_groups" title="wikilink">classification of finitely generated abelian groups</a> and sketched the relation with the theory of <a href="module_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">modules</a> that had just been developed by <a href="Richard_Dedekind" title="wikilink">Dedekind</a>.</p>
<h3 id="number-theory">Number theory</h3>

<p>Three joint papers with Frobenius deal with the theory of <a href="elliptic_function" title="wikilink">elliptic functions</a>. Today Stickelberger's name is most closely associated with his 1890 paper that established the <a href="Stickelberger_relation" title="wikilink">Stickelberger relation</a> for cyclotomic <a href="Gaussian_sum" title="wikilink">Gaussian sums</a>. This generalized earlier work of <a href="Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi" title="wikilink">Jacobi</a> and <a href="Ernst_Kummer" title="wikilink">Kummer</a> and was later used by <a href="David_Hilbert" title="wikilink">Hilbert</a> in his formulation of the reciprocity laws in <a href="algebraic_number_field" title="wikilink">algebraic number fields</a>. The Stickelberger relation also yields information about the structure of the <a href="class_group" title="wikilink">class group</a> of a <a href="cyclotomic_field" title="wikilink">cyclotomic field</a> as a module over its abelian <a href="Galois_group" title="wikilink">Galois group</a> (cf <a href="Iwasawa_theory" title="wikilink">Iwasawa theory</a>).</p>
