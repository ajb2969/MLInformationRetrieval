R-algebroid

In mathematics, R-algebroids are constructed starting from groupoids. These are more abstract concepts than the Lie algebroids that play a similar role in the theory of Lie groupoids to that of Lie algebras in the theory of Lie groups. (Thus, a Lie algebroid can be thought of as 'a Lie algebra with many objects ').
Definition
An R-algebroid, 
 
 
 
 , is constructed from a groupoid 
 
 
 
  as follows. The object set of 
 
 
 
  is the same as that of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the free R-module on the set 
 
 
 
 , with composition given by the usual bilinear rule, extending the composition of 
 
 
 
 .1
R-category
A groupoid 
 
 
 
  can be regarded as a category with invertible morphisms. Than an R-category is defined as an extension of the R-algebroid concept by replacing the groupoid 
 
 
 
  in this construction with a general category C that does not have all morphisms invertible.
R-algebroids via convolution products
One can also define the R-algebroid, 
 
 
 
 , to be the set of functions

with finite support, and with the convolution product defined as follows: 
 
 
 
  .2
Only this second construction is natural for the topological case, when one needs to replace 'function' by 'continuous function with compact support', and in this case 
 
 
 
 .
Examples

Every Lie algebra is a Lie algebroid over the one point manifold.
