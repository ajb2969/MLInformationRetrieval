   R-algebroid      R-algebroid   In mathematics , R-algebroids are constructed starting from groupoids . These are more abstract concepts than the Lie algebroids that play a similar role in the theory of Lie groupoids to that of Lie algebras in the theory of Lie groups . (Thus, a Lie algebroid can be thought of as 'a Lie algebra with many objects ').  Definition  An R-algebroid ,    R  𝖦      R  𝖦    R\mathsf{G}   , is constructed from a groupoid   𝖦   𝖦   \mathsf{G}   as follows. The object set of    R  𝖦      R  𝖦    R\mathsf{G}   is the same as that of   𝖦   𝖦   \mathsf{G}   and    R  𝖦   (  b  ,  c  )       R  𝖦   b  c     R\mathsf{G}(b,c)   is the free  R-module on the set    𝖦   (  b  ,  c  )       𝖦   b  c     \mathsf{G}(b,c)   , with composition given by the usual bilinear rule, extending the composition of   𝖦   𝖦   \mathsf{G}   . 1  R-category  A groupoid   𝖦   𝖦   \mathsf{G}   can be regarded as a category with invertible morphisms. Than an R-category is defined as an extension of the R -algebroid concept by replacing the groupoid   𝖦   𝖦   \mathsf{G}   in this construction with a general category C that does not have all morphisms invertible.  R-algebroids via convolution products  One can also define the R-algebroid ,      R  ¯   𝖦   :=   R  𝖦   (  b  ,  c  )       assign     normal-¯  R   𝖦     R  𝖦   b  c      {\bar{R}}\mathsf{G}:=R\mathsf{G}(b,c)   , to be the set of functions      𝖦   (  b  ,  c  )    ⟶  R     normal-⟶    𝖦   b  c    R    \mathsf{G}(b,c){\longrightarrow}R    with finite support , and with the convolution product defined as follows:      (   f  *  g   )    (  z  )    =    ∑   {    (   f  x   )    (   g  y   )    ∣   z  =   x  ∘  y    }             f  g   z      conditional-set      f  x     g  y      z    x  y        \displaystyle(f*g)(z)=\sum\{(fx)(gy)\mid z=x\circ y\}   . 2  Only this second construction is natural for the topological case, when one needs to replace ' function ' by ' continuous function with compact support ', and in this case    R  ≅  ℂ      R  ℂ    R\cong\mathbb{C}   .
