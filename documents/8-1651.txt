   Query (complexity)      Query (complexity)   In descriptive complexity , a query is a mapping from structures of one signature to structures of another vocabulary. Neil Immerman , in his book "Descriptive Complexity", "use[s] the concept of query as the fundamental paradigm of computation" (p. 17).  Given signatures   σ   σ   \sigma   and   τ   τ   \tau   , we define the set of structures on each language,    STRUC   [  σ  ]       STRUC   delimited-[]  σ     \mbox{STRUC}[\sigma]   and    STRUC   [  τ  ]       STRUC   delimited-[]  τ     \mbox{STRUC}[\tau]   . A query is then any mapping       I  :    STRUC   [  σ  ]    →   STRUC   [  τ  ]        normal-:  I   normal-→    STRUC   delimited-[]  σ      STRUC   delimited-[]  τ       I:\mbox{STRUC}[\sigma]\to\mbox{STRUC}[\tau]      Computational complexity theory can then be phrased in terms of the power of the mathematical logic necessary to express a given query.  Order-independent queries  A query is order-independent if the ordering of objects in the structure does not affect the results of the query. In databases, these queries correspond to generic queries (Immerman 1999, p. 18). A query is order-independent iff     I   (  𝔄  )    ≡   I   (  𝔅  )          I  𝔄     I  𝔅     I(\mathfrak{A})\equiv I(\mathfrak{B})   for any isomorphic structures   𝔄   𝔄   \mathfrak{A}   and   𝔅   𝔅   \mathfrak{B}   .
