Query (complexity)

In descriptive complexity, a query is a mapping from structures of one signature to structures of another vocabulary. Neil Immerman, in his book "Descriptive Complexity", "use[s] the concept of query as the fundamental paradigm of computation" (p. 17).
Given signatures 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , we define the set of structures on each language, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . A query is then any mapping





Computational complexity theory can then be phrased in terms of the power of the mathematical logic necessary to express a given query.
Order-independent queries
A query is order-independent if the ordering of objects in the structure does not affect the results of the query. In databases, these queries correspond to generic queries (Immerman 1999, p. 18). A query is order-independent iff 
 
 
 
  for any isomorphic structures 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
