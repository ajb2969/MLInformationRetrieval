   Minimum rank of a graph      Minimum rank of a graph   In mathematics, the minimum rank is a graph parameter    mr   (  G  )      mr  G    \operatorname{mr}(G)   for any graph  G . It was motivated by the Colin de Verdière's invariant .  Definition  The adjacency matrix of a given undirected graph is a symmetric matrix whose rows and columns both correspond to the vertices of the graph. Its coefficients are all 0 or 1, and the coefficient in row i and column j is nonzero whenever vertex i is adjacent to vertex j in the graph. More generally, one can define a generalized adjacency matrix to be any matrix of real numbers with the same pattern of nonzeros. The minimum rank of the graph   G   G   G   is denoted by    mr   (  G  )      mr  G    \operatorname{mr}(G)   and is defined as the smallest rank of any generalized adjacency matrix of the graph.  Properties   The minimum rank of a graph is always at most equal to n − 1, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. 1  For every induced subgraph  H of a given graph G , the minimum rank of H is at most equal to the minimum rank of G . 2  If a given graph is not connected , then its minimum rank is the sum of the minimum ranks of its connected components . 3  The minimum rank is a graph invariant : any two isomorphic graphs necessarily have the same minimum rank.   Characterization of known graph families  Several families of graphs may be characterized in terms of their minimum ranks.   For    n  ≥  2      n  2    n\geq 2   , the complete graph  K n on n vertices has minimum rank one. The only graphs that are connected and have minimum rank one are the complete graphs. 4  A path graph  P n on n vertices has minimum rank n − 1. The only n -vertex graphs with minimum rank n − 1 are the path graphs. 5  A cycle graph  C n on n vertices has minimum rank n − 2. 6  Let   G   G   G   be a 2-connected graph. Then     mr   (  G  )    =    |  G  |   -  2        mr  G       G   2     \operatorname{mr}(G)=|G|-2   if and only if   G   G   G   is a linear 2-tree. 7  A graph   G   G   G   has     mr   (  G  )    ≤  2       mr  G   2    \operatorname{mr}(G)\leq 2   if and only if the complement of   G   G   G   is of the form     (    K   s  1    ∪   K   s  2    ∪   K    p  1   ,   q  1     ∪  ⋯  ∪   K    p  k   ,   q  k      )   ∨   K  r          subscript  K   subscript  s  1     subscript  K   subscript  s  2     subscript  K    subscript  p  1    subscript  q  1     normal-⋯   subscript  K    subscript  p  k    subscript  q  k       subscript  K  r     (K_{s_{1}}\cup K_{s_{2}}\cup K_{p_{1},q_{1}}\cup\cdots\cup K_{p_{k},q_{k}})%
