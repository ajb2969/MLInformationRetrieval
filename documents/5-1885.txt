Conic constant

 In geometry, the conic constant (or Schwarzschild constant,1 after Karl Schwarzschild) is a quantity describing conic sections, and is represented by the letter K. For negative K it is given by



where e is the eccentricity of the conic section.
The equation for a conic section with apex at the origin and tangent to the y axis is



where K is the conic constant and R is the radius of curvature at x = 0.
This formulation is used in geometric optics to specify oblate elliptical (K > 0), spherical (K = 0), prolate elliptical (0 > K > −1), parabolic (K = −1), and hyperbolic (K
