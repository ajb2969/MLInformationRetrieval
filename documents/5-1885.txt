   Conic constant      Conic constant   In geometry , the conic constant (or Schwarzschild constant , 1 after Karl Schwarzschild ) is a quantity describing conic sections , and is represented by the letter K . For negative K it is given by       K  =   -   e  2     ,      K     superscript  e  2      K=-e^{2},\,     where e is the eccentricity of the conic section.  The equation for a conic section with apex at the origin and tangent to the y axis is         y  2   -   2  R  x    +    (   K  +  1   )    x  2     =  0           superscript  y  2     2  R  x        K  1    superscript  x  2     0    y^{2}-2Rx+(K+1)x^{2}=0     where K is the conic constant and R is the radius of curvature at x = 0.  This formulation is used in geometric optics to specify oblate elliptical ( K > 0), spherical ( K = 0), prolate elliptical (0 > K > −1), parabolic ( K = −1), and hyperbolic ( K      ↩
