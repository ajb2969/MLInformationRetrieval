   Vinylacetyl-CoA Delta-isomerase      Vinylacetyl-CoA Delta-isomerase   In enzymology , a vinylacetyl-CoA Delta-isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   vinylacetyl-CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   crotonyl-CoA   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , vinylacetyl-CoA , and one product , crotonyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases transposing C=C bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is vinylacetyl-CoA Delta3-Delta2-isomerase . Other names in common use include vinylacetyl coenzyme A Delta-isomerase , vinylacetyl coenzyme A isomerase , and Delta3-cis-Delta2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase . This enzyme participates in butanoate metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
