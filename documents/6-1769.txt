   Raised-cosine filter      Raised-cosine filter   The raised-cosine filter is a filter frequently used for pulse-shaping in digital modulation due to its ability to minimise intersymbol interference (ISI). Its name stems from the fact that the non-zero portion of the frequency spectrum of its simplest form (    β  =  1      β  1    \beta=1   ) is a cosine function, 'raised' up to sit above the   f   f   f   (horizontal) axis.  Mathematical description  The raised-cosine filter is an implementation of a low-pass Nyquist filter , i.e., one that has the property of vestigial symmetry. This means that its spectrum exhibits odd symmetry about    1   2  T       1    2  T     \frac{1}{2T}   , where   T   T   T   is the symbol-period of the communications system.  Its frequency-domain description is a piecewise  function , given by:       H   (  f  )    =   {      T  ,       |  f  |   ≤     1  -  β    2  T              T  2     [   1  +   cos   (      π  T   β     [    |  f  |   -     1  -  β    2  T      ]    )     ]    ,         1  -  β    2  T     <   |  f  |   ≤     1  +  β    2  T           0  ,     otherwise            H  f    cases  T      f       1  β     2  T         T  2    delimited-[]    1          π  T   β    delimited-[]      f       1  β     2  T                   1  β     2  T      f            1  β     2  T      0  otherwise     H(f)=\begin{cases}T,&|f|\leq\frac{1-\beta}{2T}\\
 \frac{T}{2}\left[1+\cos\left(\frac{\pi T}{\beta}\left[|f|-\frac{1-\beta}{2T}%
 \right]\right)\right],&\frac{1-\beta}{2T}<|f|\leq\frac{1+\beta}{2T}\\
 0,&\mbox{otherwise}\end{cases}         0  ≤  β  ≤  1        0  β       1     0\leq\beta\leq 1     and characterised by two values;   β   β   \beta   , the roll-off factor , and   T   T   T   , the reciprocal of the symbol-rate.  The impulse response of such a filter 1 is given by:       h   (  t  )    =   sinc   (   t  T   )     cos   (    π  β  t   T   )     1  -    4   β  2    t  2     T  2             h  t     sinc    t  T           π  β  t   T      1      4   superscript  β  2    superscript  t  2     superscript  T  2         h(t)=\mathrm{sinc}\left(\frac{t}{T}\right)\frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi\beta t}{T}%
 \right)}{1-\frac{4\beta^{2}t^{2}}{T^{2}}}   , in terms of the normalised sinc function .  Roll-off factor  The roll-off factor,   β   β   \beta   , is a measure of the excess bandwidth of the filter, i.e. the bandwidth occupied beyond the Nyquist bandwidth of    1   2  T       1    2  T     \frac{1}{2T}   . If we denote the excess bandwidth as    Δ  f      normal-Δ  f    \Delta f   , then:      β  =    Δ  f    (   1   2  T    )    =    Δ  f     R  S   /  2    =   2  T  Δ  f         β      normal-Δ  f     1    2  T              normal-Δ  f      subscript  R  S   2           2  T  normal-Δ  f      \beta=\frac{\Delta f}{\left(\frac{1}{2T}\right)}=\frac{\Delta f}{R_{S}/2}=2T\Delta
 f     where     R  S   =   1  T        subscript  R  S     1  T     R_{S}=\frac{1}{T}   is the symbol-rate.  The graph shows the amplitude response as   β   β   \beta   is varied between 0 and 1, and the corresponding effect on the impulse response . As can be seen, the time-domain ripple level increases as   β   β   \beta   decreases. This shows that the excess bandwidth of the filter can be reduced, but only at the expense of an elongated impulse response.      β  =  0      β  0    \beta=0     As   β   β   \beta   approaches 0, the roll-off zone becomes infinitesimally narrow, hence:        lim   β  →  0     H   (  f  )     =   rect   (   f  T   )          subscript    normal-→  β  0      H  f      rect    f  T      \lim_{\beta\rightarrow 0}H(f)=\mathrm{rect}(fT)     where    rect   (  .  )      fragments  rect   fragments  normal-(  normal-.  normal-)     \mathrm{rect}(.)   is the rectangular function , so the impulse response approaches    sinc   (   t  T   )       sinc    t  T     \mathrm{sinc}\left(\frac{t}{T}\right)   . Hence, it converges to an ideal or brick-wall filter in this case.      β  =  1      β  1    \beta=1     When    β  =  1      β  1    \beta=1   , the non-zero portion of the spectrum is a pure raised cosine, leading to the simplification:      H   (  f  )    |   β  =  1    =   {         T  2     [   1  +   cos   (   π  f  T   )     ]    ,       |  f  |   ≤    1  T          0  ,     otherwise         fragments  H   fragments  normal-(  f  normal-)    subscript  normal-|    β  1      fragments  normal-{        T  2    delimited-[]    1      π  f  T           f     1  T      0  otherwise       H(f)|_{\beta=1}=\left\{\begin{matrix}\frac{T}{2}\left[1+\cos\left(\pi fT\right%
 )\right],&|f|\leq\frac{1}{T}\\
 0,&\mbox{otherwise}\end{matrix}\right.     Bandwidth  The bandwidth of a raised cosine filter is most commonly defined as the width of the non-zero portion of its spectrum, i.e.:       B  W   =    1  2    R  S    (   β  +  1   )          B  W       1  2    subscript  R  S     β  1      BW=\frac{1}{2}R_{S}(\beta+1)   (0  The auto-correlation result can be used to analyze various sampling offset results when analyzed with auto-correlation.  Application  (Figure)  Consecutive raised-cosine impulses, demonstrating zero-ISI property   When used to filter a symbol stream, a Nyquist filter has the property of eliminating ISI, as its impulse response is zero at all    n  T      n  T    nT   (where   n   n   n   is an integer), except    n  =  0      n  0    n=0   .  Therefore, if the transmitted waveform is correctly sampled at the receiver, the original symbol values can be recovered completely.  However, in many practical communications systems, a matched filter is used in the receiver, due to the effects of white noise . For zero ISI, it is the net response of the transmit and receive filters that must equal    H   (  f  )       H  f    H(f)    :          H  R    (  f  )    ⋅   H  T     (  f  )    =   H   (  f  )           normal-⋅     subscript  H  R   f    subscript  H  T    f     H  f     H_{R}(f)\cdot H_{T}(f)=H(f)     And therefore :       |    H  R    (  f  )    |   =   |    H  T    (  f  )    |   =    |   H   (  f  )    |               subscript  H  R   f         subscript  H  T   f               H  f        |H_{R}(f)|=|H_{T}(f)|=\sqrt{|H(f)|}     These filters are called root-raised-cosine filters.
