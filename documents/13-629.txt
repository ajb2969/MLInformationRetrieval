Eckmann–Hilton duality

In the mathematical disciplines of algebraic topology and homotopy theory, Eckmann–Hilton duality in its most basic form, consists of taking a given diagram for a particular concept and reversing the direction of all arrows, much as in category theory with the idea of the opposite category.
It is named after Beno Eckmann and Peter Hilton.
For example, the fact that the dual notion of a limit is a colimit allows us to change the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms for homology to give axioms for cohomology.
Another example is given by currying, which tells us that for any object 
 
 
 
 , a map 
 
 
 
  is the same as a map 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the exponential object, given by all maps from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . In the case of topological spaces, if we take 
 
 
 
  to be the unit interval, this leads to a duality between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  which then gives a duality between the reduced suspension

 
  which is a quotient of 
 
 
 
  and the loop space

 
  which is a subspace of 
 
 
 
 . This then leads to the adjoint relation

 
  which allows the study of spectra which give rise to cohomology theories.
We can also directly relate fibrations and cofibrations: a fibration 
 
 
 
  is defined by having the homotopy lifting property, represented by the following diagram

and a cofibration 
 
 
 
  is defined by having the dual homotopy extension property, represented by dualising the previous diagram:

The above considerations also apply when looking at the sequences associated to a fibration or a cofibration, as given a fibration 
 
 
 
  we get the sequence



and given a cofibration 
 
 
 
  we get the sequence



This also allows us to relate homotopy and cohomology: we know that homotopy groups are homotopy classes of maps from the n-sphere to our space, written 
 
 
 
 , and we know that the sphere has a single nonzero (reduced) cohomology group. On the other hand, cohomology groups are homotopy classes of maps to spaces with a single nonzero homotopy group. This is given by the Eilenberg–MacLane spaces

 
  and the relation 
 
 
 
 .
