   Eckmann–Hilton duality      Eckmann–Hilton duality   In the mathematical disciplines of algebraic topology and homotopy theory , Eckmann–Hilton duality in its most basic form, consists of taking a given diagram for a particular concept and reversing the direction of all arrows, much as in category theory with the idea of the opposite category .  It is named after Beno Eckmann and Peter Hilton .  For example, the fact that the dual notion of a limit is a colimit allows us to change the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms for homology to give axioms for cohomology .  Another example is given by currying , which tells us that for any object   X   X   X   , a map     X  ×  I   →  Y     normal-→    X  I   Y    X\times I\to Y   is the same as a map    X  →   Y  I      normal-→  X   superscript  Y  I     X\to Y^{I}   , where    Y  I     superscript  Y  I    Y^{I}   is the exponential object , given by all maps from   I   I   I   to   Y   Y   Y   . In the case of topological spaces , if we take   I   I   I   to be the unit interval, this leads to a duality between    X  ×  I      X  I    X\times I   and    Y  I     superscript  Y  I    Y^{I}   which then gives a duality between the reduced suspension     Σ  X      normal-Σ  X    \Sigma X   which is a quotient of    X  ×  I      X  I    X\times I   and the loop space     Ω  Y      normal-Ω  Y    \Omega Y   which is a subspace of    Y  I     superscript  Y  I    Y^{I}   . This then leads to the adjoint relation      ⟨   Σ  X   ,  Y  ⟩   =   ⟨  X  ,   Ω  Y   ⟩          normal-Σ  X   Y    X    normal-Ω  Y      \langle\Sigma X,Y\rangle=\langle X,\Omega Y\rangle   which allows the study of spectra which give rise to cohomology theories .  We can also directly relate fibrations and cofibrations : a fibration    p  :   E  →  B      normal-:  p   normal-→  E  B     p\colon E\to B   is defined by having the homotopy lifting property , represented by the following diagram  (Figure)  Homotopy lifting property.svg   and a cofibration    i  :   A  →  X      normal-:  i   normal-→  A  X     i\colon A\to X   is defined by having the dual homotopy extension property , represented by dualising the previous diagram:  (Figure)  Homotopy extension property.svg   The above considerations also apply when looking at the sequences associated to a fibration or a cofibration, as given a fibration    F  →  E  →  B       normal-→  F  E    normal-→    B     F\to E\to B   we get the sequence      ⋯  →    Ω  2   B   →   Ω  F   →   Ω  E   →   Ω  B   →  F  →  E  →   B        normal-→  normal-⋯     superscript  normal-Ω  2   B     normal-→      normal-Ω  F     normal-→      normal-Ω  E     normal-→      normal-Ω  B     normal-→    F    normal-→    E    normal-→    B     \cdots\to\Omega^{2}B\to\Omega F\to\Omega E\to\Omega B\to F\to E\to B\,     and given a cofibration    A  →  X  →   X  /  A        normal-→  A  X    normal-→      X  A      A\to X\to X/A   we get the sequence       A  →  X  →   X  /  A   →   Σ  A   →   Σ  X   →   Σ   (   X  /  A   )    →    Σ  2   A   →  ⋯   .       normal-→  A  X    normal-→      X  A     normal-→      normal-Σ  A     normal-→      normal-Σ  X     normal-→      normal-Σ    X  A      normal-→       superscript  normal-Σ  2   A     normal-→    normal-⋯     A\to X\to X/A\to\Sigma A\to\Sigma X\to\Sigma\left(X/A\right)\to\Sigma^{2}A\to%
 \cdots.\,     This also allows us to relate homotopy and cohomology: we know that homotopy groups are homotopy classes of maps from the n -sphere to our space, written      π  n    (  X  ,  p  )    ≅   ⟨   S  n   ,  X  ⟩          subscript  π  n    X  p      superscript  S  n   X     \pi_{n}(X,p)\cong\langle S^{n},X\rangle   , and we know that the sphere has a single nonzero (reduced) cohomology group . On the other hand, cohomology groups are homotopy classes of maps to spaces with a single nonzero homotopy group. This is given by the Eilenberg–MacLane spaces     K   (  G  ,  n  )       K   G  n     K(G,n)   and the relation      H  n    (  X  ;  G  )    ≅   ⟨  X  ,   K   (  G  ,  n  )    ⟩          superscript  H  n    X  G     X    K   G  n       H^{n}(X;G)\cong\langle X,K(G,n)\rangle   .
