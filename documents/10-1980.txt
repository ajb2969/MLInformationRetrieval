   Indolepyruvate decarboxylase      Indolepyruvate decarboxylase   In enzymology , an indolepyruvate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-(indol-3-yl)pyruvate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-(indol-3-yl)acetaldehyde + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 3-(indol-3-yl)pyruvate , and two products , 2-(indol-3-yl)acetaldehyde and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-(indol-3-yl)pyruvate carboxy-lyase [(2-indol-3-yl)acetaldehyde-forming] . Other names in common use include indol-3-yl-pyruvate carboxy-lyase , and 3-(indol-3-yl)pyruvate carboxy-lyase . This enzyme participates in tryptophan metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
