   Marginal model      Marginal model   In statistics , marginal models (Heagerty & Zeger, 2000) are a technique for obtaining regression estimates in multilevel modeling , also called hierarchical linear models . People often want to know the effect of a predictor/explanatory variable X , on a response variable Y . One way to get an estimate for such effects is through regression analysis .  Why the name marginal model?  In a typical multilevel model, there are level 1 & 2 residuals (R and U variables). The two variables form a joint distribution for the response variable (    Y   i  j      subscript  Y    i  j     Y_{ij}   ). In a marginal model, we collapse over the level 1 & 2 residuals and thus marginalize (see also conditional probability ) the joint distribution into a univariate normal distribution . We then fit the marginal model to data.  For example, for the following hierarchical model,   level 1     Y   i  j    =    β   0  j    +   R   i  j          subscript  Y    i  j       subscript  β    0  j     subscript  R    i  j       Y_{ij}=\beta_{0j}+R_{ij}   , the residual is    R   i  j      subscript  R    i  j     R_{ij}   , and     v  a  r   (   R   i  j    )    =   σ  2         v  a  r   subscript  R    i  j      superscript  σ  2     var(R_{ij})=\sigma^{2}       level 2     β   0  j    =    γ  00   +   U   0  j          subscript  β    0  j       subscript  γ  00    subscript  U    0  j       \beta_{0j}=\gamma_{00}+U_{0j}   , the residual is    U   0  j      subscript  U    0  j     U_{0j}   , and     v  a  r   (   U   0  j    )    =   τ  0  2         v  a  r   subscript  U    0  j      superscript   subscript  τ  0   2     var(U_{0j})=\tau_{0}^{2}      Thus, the marginal model is,       Y   i  j    ∼   N   (   γ  00   ,   (    τ  0  2   +   σ  2    )   )       similar-to   subscript  Y    i  j      N    subscript  γ  00      superscript   subscript  τ  0   2    superscript  σ  2        Y_{ij}\sim N(\gamma_{00},(\tau_{0}^{2}+\sigma^{2}))     This model is what is used to fit to data in order to get regression estimates.
