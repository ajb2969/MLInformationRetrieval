Marginal model

In statistics, marginal models (Heagerty & Zeger, 2000) are a technique for obtaining regression estimates in multilevel modeling, also called hierarchical linear models. People often want to know the effect of a predictor/explanatory variable X, on a response variable Y. One way to get an estimate for such effects is through regression analysis.
Why the name marginal model?
In a typical multilevel model, there are level 1 & 2 residuals (R and U variables). The two variables form a joint distribution for the response variable (
 
 
 
 ). In a marginal model, we collapse over the level 1 & 2 residuals and thus marginalize (see also conditional probability) the joint distribution into a univariate normal distribution. We then fit the marginal model to data.
For example, for the following hierarchical model,

level 1
 
 
 
 , the residual is 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 



level 2
 
 
 
 , the residual is 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 


Thus, the marginal model is,



This model is what is used to fit to data in order to get regression estimates.
