Kolmogorov continuity theorem

In mathematics, the Kolmogorov continuity theorem is a theorem that guarantees that a stochastic process that satisfies certain constraints on the moments of its increments will be continuous (or, more precisely, have a "continuous version"). It is credited to the Soviet mathematician Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov.
Statement of the theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  be a stochastic process, and suppose that for all times 
 
 
 
 , there exist positive constants 
 
 
 
  such that



for all 
 
 
 
 . Then there exists a continuous version of 
 
 
 
 , i.e. a process 
 
 
 
  such that



 
  is sample continuous;
for every time 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 


Furthermore, the paths of 
 
 
 
  are almost surely 

 
 -HÃ¶lder continuous for every 
 
 
 
 .
Example
In the case of Brownian motion on 
 
 
 
 
 , the choice of constants 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  will work in the Kolmogorov continuity theorem.
