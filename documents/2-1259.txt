Borwein's algorithm

In mathematics, Borwein's algorithm is an algorithm devised by Jonathan and Peter Borwein to calculate the value of 1/π. They devised several other algorithms. They published a book: Jonathon M. Borwein, Peter B. Borwein, Pi and the AGM - A Study in Analytic Number Theory and Computational Complexity, Wiley, New York, 1987. Many of their results are available in: Jorg Arndt, Christoph Haenel, Pi Unleashed, Springer, Berlin, 2001, ISBN 3-540-66572-2.
Jonathan Borwein and Peter Borwein's Version (1993)
Start out by setting



Then



Each additional term of the series yields approximately 50 digits. This is an example of a Ramanujan–Sato series.
Cubic convergence (1991)
Start out by setting



Then iterate



Then ak converges cubically to 1/π; that is, each iteration approximately triples the number of correct digits.
Another formula for π (1989)
Start out by setting



Then



Each additional term of the partial sum yields approximately 31 digits.
Quartic algorithm (1985)
Start out by setting1



Then iterate



Then ak converges quartically against 1/π; that is, each iteration approximately quadruples the number of correct digits.
Quadratic convergence (1984)
Start out by setting2 3



Then iterate



Then pk converges quadratically to π; that is, each iteration approximately doubles the number of correct digits. The algorithm is not self-correcting; each iteration must be performed with the desired number of correct digits of π.
Quintic convergence
Start out by setting



Then iterate



Then ak converges quintically to 1/π (that is, each iteration approximately quintuples the number of correct digits), and the following condition holds:


4
Nonic convergence
Start out by setting



Then iterate



Then ak converges nonically to 1/π; that is, each iteration approximately multiplies the number of correct digits by nine.
