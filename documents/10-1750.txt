   Erythro-3-hydroxyaspartate ammonia-lyase      Erythro-3-hydroxyaspartate ammonia-lyase   In enzymology , an erythro-3-hydroxyaspartate ammonia-lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   erythro-3-hydroxy-Ls-aspartate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   oxaloacetate + NH 3    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , erythro-3-hydroxy-Ls-aspartate , and two products , oxaloacetate and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically ammonia lyases, which cleave carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is erythro-3-hydroxy-Ls-aspartate ammonia-lyase (oxaloacetate-forming) . Other names in common use include 3-hydroxyaspartate dehydratase , erythro-beta-hydroxyaspartate dehydratase , erythro-3-hydroxyaspartate dehydratase , erythro-3-hydroxy-Ls-aspartate hydro-lyase (deaminating) , and erythro-3-hydroxy-Ls-aspartate ammonia-lyase . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  References     "  Category:EC 4.3.1  Category:Pyridoxal phosphate enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
