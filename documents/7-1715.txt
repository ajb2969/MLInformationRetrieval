   Frege's theorem      Frege's theorem   In metalogic and metamathematics , Frege's theorem is a metatheorem that states that the Peano axioms of arithmetic can be derived in second-order logic from Hume's principle . It was first proven, informally, by Gottlob Frege in his Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik ( Foundations of Arithmetic ), published in 1884, and proven more formally in his Grundgesetze der Arithmetik ( Basic Laws of Arithmetic ), published in two volumes, in 1893 and 1903. The theorem was re-discovered by Crispin Wright in the early 1980s and has since been the focus of significant work. It is at the core of the philosophy of mathematics known as neo-logicism .  Frege's theorem in propositional logic  In propositional logic , Frege's theorems refers to this tautology :       (  P  →   (  Q  →  R  )   )   →   (   (  P  →  Q  )   →   (  P  →  R  )   )      fragments   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-→   fragments  normal-(  Q  normal-→  R  normal-)   normal-)   normal-→   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-→  Q  normal-)   normal-→   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-→  R  normal-)   normal-)     (P\to(Q\to R))\to((P\to Q)\to(P\to R))     References    .
