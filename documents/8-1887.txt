   Kasner metric      Kasner metric   The Kasner metric , developed by and named for the American mathematician Edward Kasner , is an exact solution to Einstein 's theory of general relativity . It describes an anisotropic universe without matter (i.e., it is a vacuum solution ). It can be written in any spacetime  dimension     D  >  3      D  3    D>3   and has strong connections with the study of gravitational chaos .  Metric and conditions  The metric in    D  >  3      D  3    D>3   spacetime dimensions is       d   s  2    =    -   d   t  2     +    ∑   j  =  1    D  -  1      t   2   p  j       [   d   x  j    ]   2            d   superscript  s  2          d   superscript  t  2       superscript   subscript     j  1      D  1       superscript  t    2   subscript  p  j      superscript   delimited-[]    d   superscript  x  j     2        \text{d}s^{2}=-\text{d}t^{2}+\sum_{j=1}^{D-1}t^{2p_{j}}[\text{d}x^{j}]^{2}   ,  and contains    D  -  1      D  1    D-1   constants    p  j     subscript  p  j    p_{j}   , called the Kasner exponents. The metric describes a spacetime whose equal-time slices are spatially flat, however space is expanding or contracting at different rates in different directions, depending on the values of the    p  j     subscript  p  j    p_{j}   . Test particles in this metric whose comoving coordinate differs by    Δ   x  j       normal-Δ   superscript  x  j     \Delta x^{j}   are separated by a physical distance     t   p  j    Δ   x  j        superscript  t   subscript  p  j    normal-Δ   superscript  x  j     t^{p_{j}}\Delta x^{j}   .  The Kasner metric is an exact solution to Einstein's equations in vacuum when the Kasner exponents satisfy the following Kasner conditions,         ∑   j  =  1    D  -  1     p  j    =  1   ,        superscript   subscript     j  1      D  1     subscript  p  j    1    \sum_{j=1}^{D-1}p_{j}=1,           ∑   j  =  1    D  -  1     p  j  2    =  1.        superscript   subscript     j  1      D  1     superscript   subscript  p  j   2    1.    \sum_{j=1}^{D-1}p_{j}^{2}=1.     The first condition defines a plane , the Kasner plane, and the second describes a sphere , the Kasner sphere. The solutions (choices of    p  j     subscript  p  j    p_{j}   ) satisfying the two conditions therefore lie on the sphere where the two intersect (sometimes confusingly also called the Kasner sphere). In   D   D   D   spacetime dimensions, the space of solutions therefore lie on a    D  -  3      D  3    D-3   dimensional sphere    S   D  -  3      superscript  S    D  3     S^{D-3}   .  Features  There are several noticeable and unusual features of the Kasner solution:   The volume of the spatial slices always goes like   t   t   t   . This is because their volume is proportional to     -  g         g     \sqrt{-g}   , and           -  g    =   t    p  1   +   p  2   +  ⋯  +   p   D  -  1      =  t            g     superscript  t     subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2   normal-⋯   subscript  p    D  1           t     \sqrt{-g}=t^{p_{1}+p_{2}+\cdots+p_{D-1}}=t         where we have used the first Kasner condition. Therefore    t  →  0     normal-→  t  0    t\to 0   can describe either a Big Bang or a Big Crunch , depending on the sense of   t   t   t       Isotropic  expansion or contraction of space is not allowed. If the spatial slices were expanding isotropically, then all of the Kasner exponents must be equal, and therefore     p  j   =   1  /   (   D  -  1   )         subscript  p  j     1    D  1      p_{j}=1/(D-1)   to satisfy the first Kasner condition. But then the second Kasner condition cannot be satisfied, for           ∑   j  =  1    D  -  1     p  j  2    =   1   D  -  1    ≠  1.          superscript   subscript     j  1      D  1     superscript   subscript  p  j   2      1    D  1         1.     \sum_{j=1}^{D-1}p_{j}^{2}=\frac{1}{D-1}\neq 1.         The FLRW metric employed in cosmology , by contrast, is able to expand or contract isotropically because of the presence of matter.    With a little more work, one can show that at least one Kasner exponent is always negative (unless we are at one of the solutions with a single     p  j   =  1       subscript  p  j   1    p_{j}=1   , and the rest vanishing). Suppose we take the time coordinate   t   t   t   to increase from zero. Then this implies that while the volume of space is increasing like   t   t   t   , at least one direction (corresponding to the negative Kasner exponent) is actually contracting.    The Kasner metric is a solution to the vacuum Einstein equations, and so the Ricci tensor always vanishes for any choice of exponents satisfying the Kasner conditions. The full Riemann tensor vanishes only when a single     p  j   =  1       subscript  p  j   1    p_{j}=1   and the rest vanish, in which case the space is flat. The Minkowski metric can be recovered via the coordinate transformation     t  ′   =   t   cosh   x  j          superscript  t  normal-′     t     subscript  x  j       t^{\prime}=t\cosh x_{j}   and     x  j  ′   =   t   sinh   x  j          superscript   subscript  x  j   normal-′     t     subscript  x  j       x_{j}^{\prime}=t\sinh x_{j}   .
