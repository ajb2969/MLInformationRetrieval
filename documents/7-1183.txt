Augmented major seventh chord

 
In music, an augmented major seventh chord, augmented/major seventh chord, or major seventh sharp five chord (written as +M7, +7, M75, M7(5), M7/5, M7+5, etc.) is a nondominant seventh chord comprising the root note, the note a major third above the root, the note an augmented fifth above the root, and the note a major seventh above the root: 1-3-5-7, and is associated with the augmented scale1 (see jazz scale and chord-scale system). When used in jazz scores, a number of symbols can be used to represent this chord, including maj+7, and +7.
This chord comes from the third mode of the both the harmonic minor and the melodic minor scales. For example, the third mode of the A minor melodic consists of C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. Therefore, the notes of the C maj7(5) chord are C, E, G, and B.
As with dominant seventh chords, nondominant seventh chords including the augmented major seventh usually progress according to the circle, thus III+
 
 
 
  resolves to vi or VI.2 For example, C maj7(5) usually resolves to F.
The chord can be represented by the integer notation {0, 4, 8, 11}.
