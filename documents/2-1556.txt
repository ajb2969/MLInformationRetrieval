   Dating the Bible      Dating the Bible   The oldest surviving Hebrew Bible manuscripts —including the Dead Sea Scrolls —date to about the 2nd century BCE ( fragmentary ) and some are stored at the Shrine of the Book in Jerusalem. The oldest extant complete text survives in a Greek translation called the Septuagint , dating to the 4th century CE ( Codex Sinaiticus ). The oldest extant manuscripts of the vocalized Masoretic Text (the basis of modern editions), date to the 9th century CE. 1 With the exception of a few biblical sections in the Prophets , virtually no biblical text is contemporaneous with the events it describes. 2  Internal evidence in the texts suggests dating the individual books of the 27-book New Testament canon in the 1st century CE . The first book written was probably 1 Thessalonians , written around 50 CE. 3 The final book (in the ordering of the canon), the Book of Revelation , is said to have been written by John of Patmos during the reign of Domitian (81–96). 4  Since the original recording of the scriptures, various scribes have made numerous copies of the written originals, which are no longer extant . Copies have been made of those copies, resulting in several text types . Archaeologists have recovered about 5,500 New Testament  manuscripts : either fragments or complete books. 5 The earliest extant fragment of the New Testament is the Rylands Library Papyrus P52 , a piece of the Gospel of John dated to the first half of the 2nd century. Dating the composition of the texts relies primarily on internal evidence, including direct references to historical events— textual criticism and philological and linguistic evidence provide more subjective indications.  The Hebrew Bible  Torah  The first five books of the bible in Judaism are called the Torah , meaning "instruction" (it was translated to nomos /law in the Septuagint ), and are regarded as the most important section of the Scriptures, are attributed to have been written between the 16th century and the 12th century BCE by Moses , but scholars now believe that they were actually written by four main sources known as JEDP. This modern explanation of authorship is justified by variations in writing styles, differences in language choice especially in reference to God, tones in writing, contradictory and repetitious segments, and that the books refer to Moses in third person as well as describing his death. Followers of the Copenhagen School place its origins in 5th century Yehud Medinata . 6  Deuteronomy is treated separately from Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers. The process of its formation probably took several hundred years, from the 8th century to the 6th BCE. 7 It began as no more than the set of religious laws which today make up the bulk of the book; later it was extended in order to be used as the introduction to the comprehensive history of Israel written in the early part of the 6th century; and later still it was detached from the history, extended yet again, and used to conclude the story told in Genesis–Exodus–Leviticus–Numbers. 8  Nevi'im (Prophets)      Book of Nevi'im   Scholarly dating       Book of Joshua   ca. 625 BCE by the Deuteronomist (called D) working with traditional materials     Book of Judges   ca. 625 BCE by the Deuteronomist (called D) working with traditional materials     Books of Samuel   ca. 625 BCE by the Deuteronomist (called D) working with traditional materials     Books of Kings   ca. 625 BCE by the Deuteronomist (called D) working with traditional materials     Book of Isaiah   Three main authors and an extensive editing process: Isaiah 1–39 "Historical Isaiah" with multiple layers of editing, 8th century BCE Isaiah 40–55 Exilic (Deutero-Isaiah), 6th century BCE Isaiah 56–66 post-Exilic (Trito-Isaiah), 6th–5th century BCE      Book of Jeremiah   late 6th century BCE or later     Book of Ezekiel   6th century BCE or later     Book of Hosea   8th century BCE or later     Book of Joel   unknown     Book of Amos   8th century BCE or later     Book of Obadiah   6th century BCE or later     Book of Jonah   6th century BCE or later     Book of Micah   mid 6th century BCE or later     Book of Nahum   8th century BCE or later     Book of Habakkuk   6th century BCE or later     Book of Zephaniah   7th century BCE or later     Book of Haggai   5th century BCE or later     Book of Zechariah   5th century BCE or later     Book of Malachi   Early 5th century BCE or later       Ketuvim (Writings)      Book of Ketuvim   Scholarly dating        Psalms   The bulk of the Psalms appear to have been written for use in the Temple, which existed from around 950-586 BCE and, after rebuilding, from the 5th century BCE until 70 CE.
