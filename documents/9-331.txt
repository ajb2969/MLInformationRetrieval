Flatness (systems theory)

Flatness in systems theory is a system property that extends the notion of controllability from linear systems to nonlinear dynamical systems. A system that has the flatness property is called a flat system. Flat systems have a (fictitious) flat output, which can be used to explicitly express all states and inputs in terms of the flat output and a finite number of its derivatives. Flatness in systems theory is based on the mathematical notion of flatness in commutative algebra and is applied in control theory.
Definition
A nonlinear system



is flat, if there exists an output



that satisfies the following conditions:

The signals 
 
 
 
  are representable as functions of the states 
 
 
 
  and inputs 
 
 
 
  and a finite number of derivatives with respect to time 
 
 

 
 .


The states 
 
 
 
  and inputs 
 
 
 
  are representable as functions of the outputs 
 
 
 
  and of its derivatives with respect to time 
 
 
 
 .


The components of 
 
 
 
  are differentially independent, that is, they satisfy no differential equation of the form 
 
 
 
 .

If these conditions are satisfied at least locally, then the (possibly fictitious) output is called flat output, and the system is flat.
Relation to controllability of linear systems
A linear system

 
  with the same signal dimensions for 
 
 
 
  as the nonlinear system is flat, if and only if it is controllable. For linear systems both properties are equivalent, hence exchangeable.
Significance
The flatness property is useful for both the analysis of and controller synthesis for nonlinear dynamical systems. It is particularly advantageous for solving trajectory planning problems and asymptotical setpoint following control.
