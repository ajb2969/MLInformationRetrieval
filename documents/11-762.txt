N-(long-chain-acyl)ethanolamine deacylase

In enzymology, a N-(long-chain-acyl)ethanolamine deacylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-(long-chain-acyl)ethanolamine + H2O 
 
 
 
  a long-chain carboxylate + ethanolamine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-(long-chain-acyl)ethanolamine and H2O, whereas its two products are long-chain carboxylate and ethanolamine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-(long-chain-acyl)ethanolamine amidohydrolase. Other names in common use include N-acylethanolamine amidohydrolase, and acylethanolamine amidase.
