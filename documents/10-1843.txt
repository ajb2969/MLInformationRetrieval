   (heparan sulfate)-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase 1      (heparan sulfate)-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase 1   In enzymology , a [heparan sulfate]-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase 1 () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + [heparan sulfate]-glucosamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + [heparan sulfate]-glucosamine 3-sulfate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and heparan sulfate - glucosamine , whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and heparan sulfate-glucosamine 3-sulfate.  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:[heparan sulfate]-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase . Other names in common use include heparin-glucosamine 3-O-sulfotransferase , 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:heparin-glucosamine 3-O-sulfotransferase , glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase , heparan sulfate D-glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase , and isoform/isozyme 1 (3-OST-1, HS3ST1) . This enzyme participates in heparan sulfate biosynthesis and glycan structures - biosynthesis 1 .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
