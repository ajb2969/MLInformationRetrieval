   Circular segment      Circular segment   In geometry , a circular segment (symbol: ⌓ ) is a region of a circle which is "cut off" from the rest of the circle by a secant or a chord . More formally, a circular segment is a region of two-dimensional space that is bounded by an arc (of less than 180°) of a circle and by the chord connecting the endpoints of the arc.  Formula  (Figure)  A circular segment (in green) is enclosed between a secant/chord (the dashed line) and the arc whose endpoints equal the chord's (the arc shown above the green area).   Let R be the radius of the circle , θ is the central angle in radians, α is the central angle in degrees, c the chord length , s the arc length, h the height of the segment, and d the height of the triangular portion.   The radius is    R  =   h  +  d   =    h  /  2   +     c  2   /  8   h              R    h  d            h  2        superscript  c  2   8   h    absent  absent        R=h+d=h/2+c^{2}/8h\frac{}{}     The arc length is    s  =    α  180   π  R   =   θ  R   =    arcsin   (   c   h  +    c  2    4  h      )     (   h  +    c  2    4  h     )          s      α  180   π  R          θ  R              c    h     superscript  c  2     4  h         h     superscript  c  2     4  h         s=\frac{\alpha}{180}\pi R={\theta}R=\arcsin\left(\frac{c}{h+\frac{c^{2}}{4h}}%
 \right)\left(h+\frac{c^{2}}{4h}\right)       The chord length is    c  =   2  R   sin   θ  2     =   R    2  -   2   cos  θ             c    2  R      θ  2            R      2    2    θ          c=2R\sin\frac{\theta}{2}=R\sqrt{2-2\cos\theta}       The height is    h  =   R   (   1  -   cos   θ  2     )    =   R  -     R  2   -    c  2   4            h    R    1      θ  2             R       superscript  R  2      superscript  c  2   4         h=R\left(1-\cos\frac{\theta}{2}\right)=R-\sqrt{R^{2}-\frac{c^{2}}{4}}       The angle is    θ  =   2   arctan   c   2  d      =   2   arccos   d  R     =   2   arcsin   c   2  R            θ    2      c    2  d             2      d  R            2      c    2  R         \theta=2\arctan\frac{c}{2d}=2\arccos\frac{d}{R}=2\arcsin\frac{c}{2R}      Area  The area of the circular segment is equal to the area of the circular sector minus the area of the triangular portion—that is,       A  =     R  2   2    (   θ  -   sin  θ    )     .
