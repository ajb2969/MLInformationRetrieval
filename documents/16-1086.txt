   Algebraic vector bundle      Algebraic vector bundle   In mathematics , an algebraic vector bundle is a vector bundle for which all the transition maps are algebraic functions .  Serre' theorem states that the category of algebraic vector bundles on an algebraic variety X is anti-equivalent to the category of locally free sheaves on X .
