Frink ideal

In mathematics, a Frink ideal, introduced by Orrin Frink, is a certain kind of subset of a partially ordered set.
Basic definitions
LU(A) is the set of all common lower bounds of the set of all common upper bounds of the subset A of a partially ordered set.
A subset I of a partially ordered set (P, ≤) is a Frink ideal, if the following condition holds:
For every finite subset S of P, S 
 
 
 
  I implies that LU(S) 
 
 
 
  I.
A subset I of a partially ordered set (P,≤) is a normal ideal or a cut if LU(I) 
 
 
 
  I.
Remarks

Every Frink ideal I is a lower set.
A subset I of a lattice (P, ≤) is a Frink ideal if and only if it is a lower set that is closed under finite joins (suprema).
Every normal ideal is a Frink ideal.
