   Recursive tree      Recursive tree   In graph theory , a recursive tree (i.e., unordered tree) is a non-planar labeled rooted tree . A size- n recursive tree is labeled by distinct integers 1, 2, ..., n , where the labels are strictly increasing starting at the root labeled 1. Recursive trees are non-planar, which means that the children of a particular node are not ordered. E.g. the following two size-three recursive trees are the same.  1          1

Properties  The number of size- n recursive trees is given by        T  n   =    (   n  -  1   )   !    .       subscript  T  n       n  1      T_{n}=(n-1)!.\,     Hence the exponential generating function  T ( z ) of the sequence T n is given by        T   (  z  )    =    ∑   n  ≥  1      T  n     z  n    n  !      =   log   (   1   1  -  z    )     .          T  z     subscript     n  1       subscript  T  n      superscript  z  n     n               1    1  z        T(z)=\sum_{n\geq 1}T_{n}\frac{z^{n}}{n!}=\log\left(\frac{1}{1-z}\right).     Combinatorically a recursive tree can be interpreted as a root followed by an unordered sequence of recursive trees. Let F denote the family of recursive trees.      F  =  ∘  +   1   1  !    ⋅  ∘  ×  F  +   1   2  !    ⋅  ∘  ×  F  *  F  +   1   3  !    ⋅  ∘  ×  F  *  F  *  F  *  ⋯  =  ∘  ×  exp   (  F  )   ,     fragments  F       1    1    normal-⋅    F     1    2    normal-⋅    F   F     1    3    normal-⋅    F   F   F   normal-⋯       fragments  normal-(  F  normal-)   normal-,    F=\circ+\frac{1}{1!}\cdot\circ\times F+\frac{1}{2!}\cdot\circ\times F*F+\frac{%
 1}{3!}\cdot\circ\times F*F*F*\cdots=\circ\times\exp(F),     where   ∘     \circ   denotes the node labeled by 1, × the Cartesian product and   *     *   the partition product for labeled objects.  By translation of the formal description one obtains the differential equation for T ( z )         T  ′    (  z  )    =   exp   (   T   (  z  )    )     ,         superscript  T  normal-′   z       T  z      T^{\prime}(z)=\exp(T(z)),     with T (0) = 0.  Bijections  There are bijective correspondences between recursive trees of size n and permutations of size n − 1.  Applications  Recursive trees can be generated using a simple stochastic process. Such random recursive trees are used as simple models for epidemics.
