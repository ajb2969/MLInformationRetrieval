   Bid–ask matrix      Bid–ask matrix   The bid–ask matrix is a matrix with elements corresponding with exchange rates between the assets . These rates are in physical units (e.g. number of stocks) and not with respect to any numeraire . The    (  i  ,  j  )     i  j    (i,j)   element of the matrix is the number of units of asset   i   i   i   which can be exchanged for 1 unit of asset   j   j   j   .  Mathematical Definition  A    d  ×  d      d  d    d\times d   matrix    Π  =    [   π   i  j    ]     1  ≤  i   ,   j  ≤  d         normal-Π   subscript   delimited-[]   subscript  π    i  j      formulae-sequence    1  i     j  d       \Pi=\left[\pi_{ij}\right]_{1\leq i,j\leq d}   is a bid-ask matrix , if        π   i  j    >  0       subscript  π    i  j    0    \pi_{ij}>0   for     1  ≤  i   ,   j  ≤  d      formulae-sequence    1  i     j  d     1\leq i,j\leq d   . Any trade has a positive exchange rate.       π   i  i    =  1       subscript  π    i  i    1    \pi_{ii}=1   for    1  ≤  i  ≤  d        1  i       d     1\leq i\leq d   . Can always trade 1 unit with itself.       π   i  j    ≤    π   i  k     π   k  j          subscript  π    i  j       subscript  π    i  k     subscript  π    k  j       \pi_{ij}\leq\pi_{ik}\pi_{kj}   for     1  ≤   i  ,  j    ,   k  ≤  d      formulae-sequence    1   i  j      k  d     1\leq i,j,k\leq d   . A direct exchange is always at most as expensive as a chain of exchanges. 1   Example  Assume a market with 2 assets (A and B), such that   x   x   x   units of A can be exchanged for 1 unit of B, and   y   y   y   units of B can be exchanged for 1 unit of A. Then the bid–ask matrix    Π   normal-Π   \Pi   is:      Π  =   [     1    x      y    1     ]       normal-Π    1  x    y  1      \Pi=\begin{bmatrix}1&x\\
 y&1\end{bmatrix}     Relation to solvency cone  If given a bid–ask matrix   Π   normal-Π   \Pi   for   d   d   d   assets such that    Π  =    (   π   i  j    )     1  ≤  i   ,   j  ≤  d         normal-Π   subscript   superscript  π    i  j     formulae-sequence    1  i     j  d       \Pi=\left(\pi^{ij}\right)_{1\leq i,j\leq d}   and    m  ≤  d      m  d    m\leq d   is the number of assets which with any non-negative quantity of them can be "discarded" (traditionally    m  =  d      m  d    m=d   ). Then the solvency cone      K   (  Π  )    ⊂   ℝ  d         K  normal-Π    superscript  ℝ  d     K(\Pi)\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}   is the convex cone spanned by the unit vectors      e  i   ,  1   ≤  i  ≤  m          superscript  e  i   1   i       m     e^{i},1\leq i\leq m   and the vectors         π   i  j     e  i    -   e  j    ,  1   ≤  i   ,   j  ≤  d      formulae-sequence          superscript  π    i  j     superscript  e  i     superscript  e  j    1   i     j  d     \pi^{ij}e^{i}-e^{j},1\leq i,j\leq d   . 2  Similarly given a (constant) solvency cone it is possible to extract the bid–ask matrix from the bounding vectors.  Notes   The bid–ask spread for pair    (  i  ,  j  )     i  j    (i,j)   is    {   1   π   j  i     ,   π   i  j    }       1   subscript  π    j  i      subscript  π    i  j      \left\{\frac{1}{\pi_{ji}},\pi_{ij}\right\}   .  If     π   i  j    =   1   π   j  i          subscript  π    i  j      1   subscript  π    j  i       \pi_{ij}=\frac{1}{\pi_{ji}}   then that pair is frictionless .
