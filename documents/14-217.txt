Bid–ask matrix

The bid–ask matrix is a matrix with elements corresponding with exchange rates between the assets. These rates are in physical units (e.g. number of stocks) and not with respect to any numeraire. The 
 
 
 
  element of the matrix is the number of units of asset 
 
 
 
  which can be exchanged for 1 unit of asset 
 
 
 
 .
Mathematical Definition
A 
 
 
 
 
  matrix 
 
 
 
  is a bid-ask matrix, if



 
  for 
 
 
 
 . Any trade has a positive exchange rate.


 
  for 
 
 
 
 
 . Can always trade 1 unit with itself.


 
  for 
 
 
 
 . A direct exchange is always at most as expensive as a chain of exchanges.1

Example
Assume a market with 2 assets (A and B), such that 
 
 
 
  units of A can be exchanged for 1 unit of B, and 
 
 
 
  units of B can be exchanged for 1 unit of A. Then the bid–ask matrix

 
 
  is:



Relation to solvency cone
If given a bid–ask matrix 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  assets such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the number of assets which with any non-negative quantity of them can be "discarded" (traditionally 
 
 
 
 ). Then the solvency cone

 
  is the convex cone spanned by the unit vectors 
 
 
 
  and the vectors 
 
 
 
 .2
Similarly given a (constant) solvency cone it is possible to extract the bid–ask matrix from the bounding vectors.
Notes

The bid–ask spread for pair 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  then that pair is frictionless.
