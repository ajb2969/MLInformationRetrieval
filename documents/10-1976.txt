   Hydroxynitrilase      Hydroxynitrilase   In enzymology , a hydroxynitrilase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetone cyanohydrin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cyanide + acetone   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , acetone cyanohydrin , and two products , cyanide and acetone .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetone-cyanohydrin acetone-lyase (cyanide-forming) . Other names in common use include alpha-hydroxynitrile lyase , hydroxynitrile lyase , acetone-cyanhydrin lyase [mis-spelt] , acetone-cyanohydrin acetone-lyase , oxynitrilase , 2-hydroxyisobutyronitrile acetone-lyase , 2-hydroxyisobutyronitrile acetone-lyase (cyanide-forming) , and acetone-cyanohydrin lyase .
