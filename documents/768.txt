   TSL color space      TSL color space  '''TSL color space''' is a perceptual [[color space]] which defines color as [[tint]] (the degr ee to which a stimulus can be described as similar to or different from another stimuli that are described as red , green , blue , yellow , and white , can be thought of as hue with white added), saturation (the colorfulness of a stimulus relative to its own brightness ), and lightness (the brightness of a stimulus relative to a stimulus that appears white in similar viewing conditions). Proposed by Jean-Christophe Terrillon and Shigeru Akamatsu , 1 TSL color space was developed primarily for the purpose of face detection .  Conversion between RGB and TSL  The conversion from gamma-corrected RGB values to TSL is straightforward: 2     T  =   {         1   2  π     arctan    r  ′    g  ′      +   1  4    ,        if    g  ′    >  0           1   2  π     arctan    r  ′    g  ′      +   3  4    ,        if    g  ′    <  0        0  ,        if    g  ′    =  0           T   cases        1    2  π         superscript  r  normal-′    superscript  g  normal-′        1  4        if   superscript  g  normal-′    0         1    2  π         superscript  r  normal-′    superscript  g  normal-′        3  4        if   superscript  g  normal-′    0   0      if   superscript  g  normal-′    0      T=\begin{cases}\frac{1}{2\pi}\arctan{\frac{r^{\prime}}{g^{\prime}}}+\frac{1}{4%

Utilizing normalized r and g allows for chrominance spaces TSL to be more efficient for skin color segmentation. Additionally with this normalization, the sensitivity of the chrominance distributions to the variability of skin color is significantly reduced, allowing for an easier detection of different skin tones. 3  Comparison of TSL to other color spaces  Terrillon investigated the efficiency of facial detection for several different color spaces. Testing consisted of using the same algorithm with 10 different color spaces to detect faces in 90 images with 133 faces and 59 subjects - 27 Asian, 31 Caucasian, and 1 African). TSL showed superior performance to the other spaces, with 90.8% correct detection and 84.9% correct rejection. A full comparison can be seen in the table below. 4      Color Space   # of Elements   CD (%)   CR (%)       TSL   258   90.8   84.9     r-g   328   74.6   80.3     CIE-xy   388   56.6   83.5     CIE-DSH   318   60.9   75.0     HSV   408   55.7   84.7     YIQ   471   47.3   79.8     YES   494   41.6   80.3     CIELUV   418   24.1   79.0     CIELAB   399   38.4   83.6     Disadvantages of TSL  TSL space could be made more efficient and robust. There currently exists no color correction algorithms for different camera systems. Additionally, despite a better accuracy of skin tone detection, detecting dark skin color still proves to be a challenge. 5  Applications  Being a relatively new color space and having very specific uses, TSL hasn’t been widely implemented. Again, it is only very useful in skin detection algorithms. Skin detection itself can be used for a variety of applications – face detection, person tracking (for surveillance and cinematographic purposes ), and pornography filtering are a few examples. A Self-Organizing Map (SOM) was implemented in skin detection using TSL and achieved comparable results to older methods of histograms and Gaussian mixture models . 6  See also   HSL and HSV  Face detection  List of color spaces and their uses   References  "  Category:Color space     ↩   ↩    ↩
