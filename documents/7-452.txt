   Exhaustion by compact sets      Exhaustion by compact sets   In mathematics , especially analysis , exhaustion by compact sets of an open set  E in the Euclidean space  R n (or a manifold with countable base ) is an increasing sequence of compact sets     K  j     subscript  K  j    K_{j}   , where by increasing we mean    K  j     subscript  K  j    K_{j}   is a subset of    K   j  +  1      subscript  K    j  1     K_{j+1}   , with the limit ( union ) of the sequence being E .  Sometimes one requires the sequence of compact sets to satisfy one more property— that    K  j     subscript  K  j    K_{j}   is contained in the interior of    K   j  +  1      subscript  K    j  1     K_{j+1}   for each   j   j   j   . This, however, is dispensed in R n or a manifold with countable base.  For example, consider a unit open disk and the concentric closed disk of each radius inside. That is let    E  =   {  z  ;  |  z  |  <  1  }      fragments  E    fragments  normal-{  z  normal-;  normal-|  z  normal-|   1  normal-}     E=\{z;|z|<1\}   and     K  j   =   {  z  ;  |  z  |  ≤   (  1  -  1  /  j  )   }      fragments   subscript  K  j     fragments  normal-{  z  normal-;  normal-|  z  normal-|    fragments  normal-(  1   1   j  normal-)   normal-}     K_{j}=\{z;|z|\leq(1-1/j)\}   . Then taking the limit (union) of the sequence    K  j     subscript  K  j    K_{j}   gives E . The example can be easily generalized in other dimensions.
