   Behrend's trace formula      Behrend's trace formula   In algebraic geometry , Behrend's formula is a generalization of the Grothendieck–Lefschetz trace formula to a smooth  algebraic stack over a finite field, conjectured in 1993 1 and proven in 2003 2 by Kai Behrend . Unlike the classical one, the formula counts points in the " stacky way "; it takes into account the presence of nontrivial automorphisms.  The desire for the formula comes from the fact that it applies to the moduli stack of principal bundles on a curve over a finite field (in some instances indirectly, via the Harder–Narasimhan stratification , as the moduli stack is not of finite type. 3 4 ) See the moduli stack of principal bundles and references therein for the precise formulation in this case.  Deligne found an example 5 that shows the formula may be interpreted as a sort of the Selberg trace formula .  A proof of the formula in the context of the six operations formalism developed by Laszlo and Olsson 6 is given by Shenghao Sun. 7  Formulation  By definition, if C is a category in which each object has finitely many automorphisms, the number of points in   C   C   C   is denoted by        #  C   =    ∑  p    1   #   Aut   (  p  )        ,        normal-#  C     subscript   p     1    normal-#   Aut  p        \#C=\sum_{p}{1\over\#\operatorname{Aut}(p)},   with the sum running over representatives p of all isomorphism classes in C . (The series may diverge in general.) The formula states: for a smooth algebraic stack X of finite type over a finite field    𝐅  q     subscript  𝐅  q    \mathbf{F}_{q}   and the "arithmetic" Frobenius      ϕ   -  1    :   X  →  X      normal-:   superscript  ϕ    1     normal-→  X  X     \phi^{-1}:X\to X   , i.e., the inverse of the usual geometric Frobenius   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   in Grothendieck's formula, 8 9        #  X   (   𝐅  q   )    =    q   dim  X      ∑   i  =  0   ∞      (   -  1   )   i    tr   (   ϕ   -  1    ;    H  i    (  X  ,   ℚ  l   )    )        .        normal-#  X   subscript  𝐅  q       superscript  q   dim  X      superscript   subscript     i  0         superscript    1   i    tr   superscript  ϕ    1       superscript  H  i    X   subscript  ℚ  l           \#X(\mathbf{F}_{q})=q^{\operatorname{dim}X}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{i}%
 \operatorname{tr}(\phi^{-1};H^{i}(X,\mathbb{Q}_{l})).     Here, it is crucial that the cohomology of a stack is with respect to the smooth topology (not etale).  When X is a variety, the smooth cohomology is the same as etale one and, via the Poincaré duality , this is equivalent to Grothendieck's trace formula. (But the proof relies on Grothendieck's formula, so this does not subsume Grothendieck's.)  Simple example  Consider     B   𝔾  m    =   [   Spec    𝐅  q   /   𝔾  m     ]         B   subscript  𝔾  m     delimited-[]   Spec     subscript  𝐅  q    subscript  𝔾  m        B\mathbb{G}_{m}=[\operatorname{Spec}\mathbf{F}_{q}/\mathbb{G}_{m}]   , the classifying stack of the multiplicative group scheme (that is,      𝔾  m    (  R  )    =   R  ×          subscript  𝔾  m   R    superscript  R      \mathbb{G}_{m}(R)=R^{\times}   ). By definition,    B   𝔾  m    (   𝐅  q   )       B   subscript  𝔾  m    subscript  𝐅  q     B\mathbb{G}_{m}(\mathbf{F}_{q})   is the category of principal     𝔾  m     subscript  𝔾  m    \mathbb{G}_{m}   -bundles over    Spec   𝐅  q      Spec   subscript  𝐅  q     \operatorname{Spec}\mathbf{F}_{q}   , which has only one isomorphism class (since all such bundles are trivial by Lang's theorem ). Its group of automorphisms is    𝔾  m     subscript  𝔾  m    \mathbb{G}_{m}   , which means that the number of    𝐅  q     subscript  𝐅  q    \mathbf{F}_{q}   -isomorphisms is     #   𝔾  m    (   𝐅  q   )    =   𝐅  q  ×   =   q  -  1           normal-#   subscript  𝔾  m    subscript  𝐅  q     superscript   subscript  𝐅  q            q  1      \#\mathbb{G}_{m}(\mathbf{F}_{q})=\mathbf{F}_{q}^{\times}=q-1   .  On the other hand, we may compute the l -adic cohomology of    B   𝔾  m       B   subscript  𝔾  m     B\mathbb{G}_{m}   directly. We remark that in the topological setting, we have     B   ℂ  ×    ≅   ℂ   ℙ  ∞          B   superscript  ℂ       ℂ   superscript  ℙ       B\mathbb{C}^{\times}\cong\mathbb{CP}^{\infty}   (where    B   ℂ  ×       B   superscript  ℂ      B\mathbb{C}^{\times}   now denotes the usual classifying space of a topological group), whose rational cohomology ring is a polynomial ring in one generator ( Borel's theorem ), but we shall not use this directly. If we wish to stay in the world of algebraic geometry, we may instead "approximate"    B   𝔾  m       B   subscript  𝔾  m     B\mathbb{G}_{m}   by projective spaces of larger and larger dimension. Thus we consider the map     B   𝔾  m    →   ℙ  N      normal-→    B   subscript  𝔾  m     superscript  ℙ  N     B\mathbb{G}_{m}\to\mathbb{P}^{N}   induced by the    𝔾  m     subscript  𝔾  m    \mathbb{G}_{m}   -bundle corresponding to    𝒪   (  1  )       𝒪  1    \mathcal{O}(1)   . This map induces an isomorphism in cohomology in degrees up to 2N . Thus the even (resp. odd) Betti numbers of    B   𝔾  m       B   subscript  𝔾  m     B\mathbb{G}_{m}   are 1 (resp. 0), and the l -adic Galois representation on the (2n) th cohomology group is the n th power of the cyclotomic character. The second part is a consequence of the fact that the cohomology of    ℙ  N     superscript  ℙ  N    \mathbb{P}^{N}   is generated by algebraic cycle classes. This shows that         ∑   i  ≥  0       (   -  1   )   i    tr   (   ϕ   -  1    ;    H  i    (   B   𝔾  m    ,   ℚ  l   )    )      =   1  +   1  /  q   +   1  /   q  2    +  ⋯   =   q   q  -  1     .          subscript     i  0       superscript    1   i    tr   superscript  ϕ    1       superscript  H  i      B   subscript  𝔾  m     subscript  ℚ  l          1    1  q     1   superscript  q  2    normal-⋯          q    q  1       \sum_{i\geq 0}(-1)^{i}\operatorname{tr}(\phi^{-1};H^{i}(B\mathbb{G}_{m},%
 \mathbb{Q}_{l}))=1+1/q+1/q^{2}+\cdots={q\over{q-1}}.   Note that     dim   B   𝔾  m     =    dim   Spec   𝐅  q     -   dim   𝔾  m     =   -  1          dimension    B   subscript  𝔾  m        dimension   Spec   subscript  𝐅  q      dimension   subscript  𝔾  m            1      \dim B\mathbb{G}_{m}=\dim\operatorname{Spec}\mathbf{F}_{q}-\dim\mathbb{G}_{m}=-1   . Multiplying by    q   -  1      superscript  q    1     q^{-1}   , one obtains the predicted equality.  Notes  References     "  Category:Theorems in algebraic geometry     Behrend, K.
