Dichromatic reflectance model

In Shaferâ€™s dichromatic reflection model, scene radiance has two components:




cb is the body reflected component
 
cs is the surface (interface) reflected component
 
mb and ms are scale factors depending on illumination, view directions and surface orientation.
 

Separation algorithm
BREN (body reflection essence-neuter) model based1
Body essence is an entity invariant to interface reflection, and has two degrees of freedom. The Gaussian coefficient generalizes a conventional simple thresholding scheme, and it provides detailed use of body color similarity.2
