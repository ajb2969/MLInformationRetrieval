   Min-plus matrix multiplication      Min-plus matrix multiplication   Min-plus matrix multiplication , also known as the distance product , is an operation on matrices .  Given two    n  ×  n      n  n    n\times n   matrices    A  =   (   a   i  j    )       A   subscript  a    i  j      A=(a_{ij})   and    B  =   (   b   i  j    )       B   subscript  b    i  j      B=(b_{ij})   , their distance product    C  =   (   c   i  j    )   =   A  ⋆  B         C   subscript  c    i  j          normal-⋆  A  B      C=(c_{ij})=A\star B   is defined as an    n  ×  n      n  n    n\times n   matrix such that     c   i  j    =    min   k  =  1   n    {    a   i  k    +   b   k  j     }         subscript  c    i  j      superscript   subscript     k  1    n      subscript  a    i  k     subscript  b    k  j        c_{ij}=\min_{k=1}^{n}\{a_{ik}+b_{kj}\}   .  This operation is closely related to the shortest path problem . If   W   W   W   is an    n  ×  n      n  n    n\times n   matrix containing the edge weights of a graph , then    W  k     superscript  W  k    W^{k}   gives the distances between vertices using paths of length at most   k   k   k   edges, and    W  n     superscript  W  n    W^{n}   is the distance matrix of the graph.
