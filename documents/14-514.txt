Min-plus matrix multiplication

Min-plus matrix multiplication, also known as the distance product, is an operation on matrices.
Given two 
 
 
 
  matrices 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , their distance product 
 
 
 
  is defined as an 
 
 
 
  matrix such that 
 
 
 
 .
This operation is closely related to the shortest path problem. If 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
  matrix containing the edge weights of a graph, then 
 
 
 
  gives the distances between vertices using paths of length at most 
 
 
 
  edges, and 
 
 
 
  is the distance matrix of the graph.
