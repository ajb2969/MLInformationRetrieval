Oregonator

The Oregonator is a theoretical model for a type of autocatalytic reaction. The Oregonator (Orygunator) is the simplest realistic model of the chemical dynamics of the oscillatory Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction.1 It was created by Richard Field and Richard M. Noyes at the University of Oregon.2 It is a portmanteau of Oregon and oscillator.
Earlier, the Brusselator model was proposed by Ilya Prigogine and his collaborators at the Free University of Brussels3 as a portmanteau of Brussels and oscillator.
The Oregonator is characterized by the reactions
