   Mannosylglycerate hydrolase      Mannosylglycerate hydrolase   Mannosylglycerate hydrolase (, 2-O-(6-phospho-mannosyl)-D-glycerate hydrolase , alpha-mannosidase , mngB (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name 2-O-(6-phospho-alpha-D-mannosyl)-D-glycerate acylhydrolase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   2-O-(6-phospho-alpha-D-mannosyl)-D-glycerate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-mannose 6-phosphate + D- glycerate    The enzyme participates in the mannosylglycerate degradation pathway of some bacteria .
