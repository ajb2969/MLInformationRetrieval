Lactaldehyde dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a lactaldehyde dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(S)-lactaldehyde + NAD+ + H2O 
 
 
 
  (S)-lactate + NADH + 2 H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are (S)-lactaldehyde, NAD+, and H2O, whereas its 3 products are (S)-lactate, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-lactaldehyde:NAD+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include L-lactaldehyde:NAD+ oxidoreductase, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-linked dehydrogenase. This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism.
Structural studies
