   Leucine—tRNA ligase      Leucine—tRNA ligase   In enzymology , a leucine-tRNA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + L-leucine + tRNALeu   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + L-leucyl-tRNALeu   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , L-leucine , and tRNA(Leu) , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and L-leucyl-tRNA(Leu) .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , to be specific those forming carbon-oxygen bonds in aminoacyl-tRNA and related compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-leucine:tRNALeu ligase (AMP-forming) . Other names in common use include leucyl-tRNA synthetase , leucyl-transfer ribonucleate synthetase , leucyl-transfer RNA synthetase , leucyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase , leucine-tRNA synthetase , and leucine translase . This enzyme participates in valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and .
