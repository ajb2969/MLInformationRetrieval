<h1>Eikonal equation</h1>
<hr/>
<p>The <strong>eikonal equation</strong> (from German <em>Eikonal</em>, which is from <a href="Ancient_Greek" title="wikilink">Greek</a> εἰκών, image<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>) is a <a class="uri" href="non-linear" title="wikilink">non-linear</a> <a href="partial_differential_equation" title="wikilink">partial differential equation</a> encountered in problems of <a href="wave_propagation" title="wikilink">wave propagation</a>, when the <a href="wave_equation" title="wikilink">wave equation</a> is approximated using the <a href="WKB_theory" title="wikilink">WKB theory</a>. It is derivable from <a href="Maxwell's_equations" title="wikilink">Maxwell's equations</a> of electromagnetics, and provides a link between <a href="physical_optics" title="wikilink">physical (wave) optics</a> and <a href="geometric_optics" title="wikilink">geometric (ray) optics</a>.</p>
<p>The eikonal equation is of the form</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$| \nabla u(x)|=F(x), \ x\in \Omega$$</span> subject to <span class="LaTeX">$u|_{\partial \Omega}=0$</span>, where <span class="LaTeX">$\Omega$</span> is an open set in <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbb{R}^n$</span> with <a class="uri" href="well-behaved" title="wikilink">well-behaved</a> boundary, <span class="LaTeX">$F(x)$</span> is a function with positive values, <span class="LaTeX">$\nabla$</span> denotes the <a class="uri" href="gradient" title="wikilink">gradient</a> and |·| is the <a href="Euclidean_norm#Euclidean_norm" title="wikilink">Euclidean norm</a>. Here, the right-hand side <span class="LaTeX">$F(x)$</span> is typically supplied as known input. Physically, the solution <span class="LaTeX">$u(x)$</span> is the shortest time needed to travel from the <a href="Boundary_(topology)" title="wikilink">boundary</a> <span class="LaTeX">$\partial \Omega$</span> to <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> inside <span class="LaTeX">$\Omega,$</span> with <span class="LaTeX">$F(x)$</span> being the time cost (not speed) at <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>.</p>
<p>In the special case when <span class="LaTeX">$F=1$</span>, the solution gives the <a href="signed_distance" title="wikilink">signed distance</a> from <span class="LaTeX">$\partial \Omega$</span>.</p>
<p>One fast computational algorithm to approximate the solution to the eikonal equation is the <a href="fast_marching_method" title="wikilink">fast marching method</a>.</p>
<h2 id="physical-interpretation">Physical interpretation</h2>
<p>The physical meaning of the eikonal equation is related to the formula</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$E = -\nabla V$$</span></p>
<p>where <span class="LaTeX">$E$</span> is the electric field strength and <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> is the electric potential. There is a similar equation for velocity potential in fluid flow and temperature in heat transfer. The physical meaning of this equation in the electromagnetic example is that any charge in the region is pushed to move at right angles to the lines of constant potential, and along lines of force determined by the field of the E vector and the sign of the charge.</p>
<p>Ray optics and electromagnetism are related by the fact that the eikonal equation gives a second electromagnetic formula of the same form as the potential equation above where the line of constant potential has been replaced by a line of constant phase and the force lines have been replaced by normal vectors coming out of the constant phase line at right angles. The magnitude of these normal vectors is given by the square root of the relative permittivity. The line of constant phase can be considered the edge of one of the advancing light waves. The normal vectors are the rays the light is traveling down in ray optics.</p>
<h2 id="mathematical-description">Mathematical description</h2>
<p>An eikonal equation is one of the form</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$H(x,\nabla u(x)) = 0$$</span></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$u(0,x') = u_0(x'),\text{ for } x = (x_1,x')$$</span> The plane <span class="LaTeX">$x = (0,x')$</span> can be thought of as the initial condition, by thinking of <span class="LaTeX">$x_1$</span> as <span class="LaTeX">$t.$</span> We could also solve the equation on a subset of this plane, or on a curved surface, with obvious modifications.</p>
<p>The eikonal equation shows up in <a href="geometrical_optics" title="wikilink">geometrical optics</a>, which is a way of studying solutions of the <a href="wave_equation" title="wikilink">wave equation</a> <span class="LaTeX">$c(x)^2 |\nabla_x u(x,t)|^2 = |\partial_t u(x,t)|^2$</span>. In geometric optics, the eikonal equation describes the phase fronts of waves. Under reasonable hypothesis on the "initial" data, the eikonal equation admits a local solution, but a global smooth solution (e.g. a solution for all time in the geometrical optics case) is not possible. The reason is that <a href="caustic_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">caustics</a> may develop. In the geometrical optics case, this means that wavefronts cross.</p>
<p>We can solve the eikonal equation using the method of characteristics. One must impose the "non-characteristic" hypothesis <span class="LaTeX">$\partial_{p_1} H(x,p) \neq 0$</span> along the initial hypersurface <span class="LaTeX">$x = (0,x')$</span>, where H=H(x,p) and p=(p<sub>1</sub>,...,p<sub>n</sub>) is the variable that gets replaced by ∇<em>u</em>. Here x=(x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>n</sub>) = (t,x').</p>
<p>First, solve the problem <span class="LaTeX">$H(x,\xi(x)) = 0$</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$\xi(x) = \nabla u(x), x\in H$</span>. This is done by defining curves (and values of <span class="LaTeX">$\xi$</span> on those curves) as</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\dot x(s) = \nabla_\xi H(x(s),\xi(s)), \;\;\;\; \dot \xi(s) = -\nabla_x H(x(s),\xi(s)).$$</span></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$x(0) = x_0, \;\;\;\; \xi(x(0)) = \nabla u(x(0)).$$</span> Note that even before we have a solution <span class="LaTeX">$u$</span>, we know <span class="LaTeX">$\nabla u(x)$</span> for <span class="LaTeX">$x = (0,x')$</span> due to our equation for <span class="LaTeX">$H$</span>. That these equations have a solution for some interval <span class="LaTeX">$0 \leq s < s_1$</span> follows from standard ODE theorems (using the non-characteristic hypothesis). These curves fill out an <a href="open_set" title="wikilink">open set</a> around the plane <span class="LaTeX">$x = (0,x')$</span>. Thus the curves define the value of <span class="LaTeX">$\xi$</span> in an open set about our initial plane. Once defined as such it is easy to see using the chain rule that <span class="LaTeX">$\partial_s H(x(s), \xi(s)) = 0$</span>, and therefore <span class="LaTeX">$H = 0$</span> along these curves.</p>
<p>We want our solution <span class="LaTeX">$u$</span> to satisfy <span class="LaTeX">$\nabla u = \xi$</span>, or more specifically, for every <span class="LaTeX">$s$</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$(\nabla u)(x(s)) = \xi(x(s)).$</span> Assuming for a minute that this is possible, for any solution <span class="LaTeX">$u(x)$</span> we must have</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\frac{d}{d s} u(x(s)) = \nabla u(x(s)) \cdot \dot x(s) = \xi \cdot \frac{\partial H}{\partial \xi}$$</span>, and therefore</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$u(x(t)) = u(x(0)) + \int_0^t \xi(x(s))\cdot \dot x(s)\, ds.$$</span> In other words, the solution <span class="LaTeX">$u$</span> will be given in a neighborhood of the initial plane by an explicit equation. However, since the different paths <span class="LaTeX">$x(t)$</span>, starting from different initial points may cross, the solution may become multi-valued, at which point we have developed caustics. We also have (even before showing that <span class="LaTeX">$u$</span> is a solution)</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\xi(x(t)) = \xi(x(0)) - \int_0^s \nabla_x H(x(s),\xi(x(s))) \, ds.$$</span></p>
<p>It remains to show that <span class="LaTeX">$\xi$</span>, which we have defined in a neighborhood of our initial plane, is the gradient of some function <span class="LaTeX">$u$</span>. This will follow if we show that the vector field <span class="LaTeX">$\xi$</span> is curl free. Consider the first term in the definition of <span class="LaTeX">$\xi$</span>. This term, <span class="LaTeX">$\xi(x(0)) = \nabla u(x(0))$</span> is curl free as it is the gradient of a function. As for the other term, we note</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_k \, \partial x_j} H = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_j \, \partial x_k} H.$$</span> The result follows.</p>
