   Osmium tetroxide      Osmium tetroxide   |Section7= |Section8= }}  Osmium tetroxide (also osmium(VIII) oxide ) is the chemical compound with the formula OsO 4 . The compound is noteworthy for its many uses, despite the rarity of osmium . It also has a number of interesting properties, one being that the solid is volatile . The compound is colourless, but most samples appear yellow. 1 This is most likely due to the presence of the impurity OsO 2 , which is yellow-brown in colour. 2  Physical properties  (Figure)  Crystal structure of OsO 4 3   Osmium(VIII) oxide forms monoclinic crystals. 4 5 It has a characteristic acrid chlorine -like odor. The element name osmium is derived from osme , Greek for odor . OsO 4 is volatile: it sublimes at room temperature . It is soluble in a wide range of organic solvents. It is also moderately soluble in water, with which it reacts reversibly to form osmic acid (see below). 6  Pure osmium(VIII) oxide is probably colourless 7 and it has been suggested that its yellow hue is due to osmium dioxide (OsO 2 ) impurities. 8 The osmium tetroxide molecule is tetrahedral and therefore non-polar. This nonpolarity helps OsO 4 penetrate charged cell membranes. OsO 4 is 518 times more soluble in carbon tetrachloride than in water.  Structure and electron configuration  The osmium of OsO 4 has an oxidation number of VIII, however the metal does not possess a corresponding 8+ charge as the bonding in the compound is largely covalent in character (the ionization energy required to produce a formal 8+ charge also far exceeds the energies available in normal chemical reactions). The osmium atom has eight valence electrons (6s 2 , 5d 6 ) with double bonds to the four oxide  ligands resulting in a 16 electron complex . This is isoelectronic with permanganate and chromate ions.  Synthesis  OsO 4 is formed slowly when osmium powder reacts with O 2 at ambient temperature. Reaction of bulk solid requires heating to 400 °C.

The net process is called dihydroxylation. This proceeds via a [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction between the OsO 4 and alkene to form an intermediate osmate ester which rapidly hydrolyses to yield the vicinal diol . As the oxygen atoms are added in a concerted step the resulting stereochemistry is cis .      OsO 4 is expensive and highly toxic, making it an unappealing reagent to use in stoichiometric amounts. However its reactions are made catalytic by adding reagents to reoxidise the Os(VI) by-product back to Os(VIII). Typical reagents include H 2 O 2 , N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO, see Upjohn dihydroxylation ) and K 3 Fe(CN) 6 , as these will not react with the alkenes on their own. Other osmium compounds can be used as catalysts, including osmate(VI) salts ([OsO 2 (OH) 4 )] 2− , and osmium trichloride hydrate (OsCl 3 · x H 2 O). These species oxidise to osmium(VIII) in the presence of such oxidants. 9  Lewis bases such as tertiary amines and pyridines increase the rate of dihydroxylation. This "ligand-acceleration" arises via the formation of adduct OsO 4 L, which adds more rapidly to the alkene. If the amine is chiral, then the dihydroxylation can proceed with enantioselectivity (see Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation ). 10 OsO 4 does not react with most carbohydrates. 11  The process can be extended to give to aldehydes in the Lemieux–Johnson oxidation , which uses periodate to achieve diol cleavage and to regenerate the catalytic loading of OsO 4 . This process is equivalent to that of ozonolysis .      Coordination chemistry  OsO 4 is a Lewis acid and a mild oxidant. Most of its reactions reflect this pattern. It reacts with alkaline aqueous solution to give the perosmate anion OsO 4 (OH) 2 2− . 12 This species is easily reduced to osmate anion, OsO 2 (OH) 4 4− .  When the Lewis base is an amine , adducts are also formed. With tert-BuNH 2 the imido derivative is produced:   OsO 4 + Me 3 CNH 2 → OsO 3 (NCMe 3 ) + H 2 O   Similarly, with NH 3 one obtains the nitrido complex :   OsO 4 + NH 3 + KOH → K[Os(N)O 3 ] + 2 H 2 O   The [Os(N)O 3 ] − anion is isoelectronic and isostructural with OsO 4 .  OsO 4 is very soluble in tert-butyl alcohol and in solution is readily reduced by molecular hydrogen to osmium metal. The suspended osmium metal can be used to catalyze  hydrogenation of a wide variety of organic chemicals containing double or triple bonds.   OsO 4 + 4 H 2 → Os (s) + 4 H 2 O   OsO 4 undergoes "reductive carbonylation" with carbon monoxide in methanol at 400 K and 200 bar of pressure to produce the triangular cluster Os 3 (CO) 12 :   3 OsO 4 + 24 CO → Os 3 (CO) 12 + 12 CO 2    Oxofluorides  Osmium forms several oxofluorides, all of which are very sensitive to moisture. Purple cis -OsO 2 F 4 forms at 77 K in an anhydrous HF solution: 13   OsO 4 + 2 KrF 2 → cis -OsO 2 F 4 + 2 Kr + O 2    OsO 4 also reacts with F 2 to form yellow OsO 3 F 2 : 14   2 OsO 4 + 2 F 2 → 2 OsO 3 F 2 + O 2    OsO 4 reacts with one equivalent of [Me 4 N]F at 298 K and 2 equivalents at 253 K:   OsO 4 + [Me 4 N]F → [Me 4 N][OsO 4 F]    OsO 4 + 2 [Me 4 N]F → [Me 4 N] 2 [ cis -OsO 4 F 2 ]   Uses  Organic synthesis  In organic synthesis OsO 4 is widely used to oxidise alkenes to the vicinal diols, adding two hydroxyl groups at the same side ( syn addition ). See reaction and mechanism above. This reaction has been made both catalytic ( Upjohn dihydroxylation ) and asymmetric ( Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation ).  Osmium(VIII) oxide is also used in catalytic amounts in the Sharpless oxyamination to give vicinal amino-alcohols.  In combination with sodium periodate , OsO 4 is used for the oxidative cleavage of alkenes ( Lemieux-Johnson oxidation ) when the periodate serves both to cleave the diol formed by dihydroxylation, and to reoxidize the OsO 3 back to OsO 4 . The net transformation is identical to that produced by ozonolysis . Below an example from the total synthesis of Isosteviol. 15  (Figure)  Isosteviol-OsO4.svg   Biological staining  (Figure)  Electron micrograph of (organic) plant tissue without (top) and with OsO 4 staining   OsO 4 is a widely used staining agent used in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to provide contrast to the image. 16 As a lipid stain, it is also useful in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as an alternative to sputter coating . It embeds a heavy metal directly into cell membranes, creating a high electron scattering rate without the need for coating the membrane with a layer of metal, which can obscure details of the cell membrane. In the staining of the plasma membrane , osmium(VIII) oxide binds phospholipid head regions, thus creating contrast with the neighbouring protoplasm (cytoplasm). Additionally, osmium(VIII) oxide is also used for fixing biological samples in conjunction with HgCl 2 . Its rapid killing abilities are used to quickly kill live specimens such as protozoa. OsO 4 stabilizes many proteins by transforming them into gels without destroying structural features. Tissue proteins that are stabilized by OsO 4 are not coagulated by alcohols during dehydration. 17 Osmium(VIII) oxide is also used as a stain for lipids in optical microscopy. 18 OsO 4 also stains the human cornea (see safety considerations ).  (Figure)  A sample of cells fixed/stained with osmium tetroxide (black) embedded in epoxy resin (amber). The cells are black as a result of the effects of osmium tetroxide.   Polymer staining  It is also used to stain copolymers preferentially, the best known example being block copolymers where one phase can be stained so as to show the microstructure of the material. For example, styrene-butadiene block copolymers have a central polybutadiene chain with polystyrene end caps. When treated with OsO 4 , the butadiene matrix reacts preferentially and so absorbs the oxide. The presence of a heavy metal is sufficient to block the electron beam, so the polystyrene domains are seen clearly in thin films in TEM .  Osmeth  OsO 4 can be stored in the form of osmeth , a golden crystalline solid which is OsO 4  complexed with hexamine ; in this form, it does not emit toxic fumes. Osmeth can be dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and diluted in an aqueous buffer solution to make a dilute (0.25%) working solution of OsO 4 . 19  Osmium ore refining  OsO 4 is an intermediate in osmium ore refining. Osmium residues are reacted with Na 2 O 2 forming [OsO 4 (OH) 2 ] 2− anions, which, when reacted with chlorine (Cl 2 ) gas and heated, form OsO 4 . The oxide is dissolved in alcoholic NaOH forming [OsO 2 (OH) 4 ] 2− anions, which, when reacted with NH 4 Cl , forms OsO 2 Cl 2 (NH 4 ) 4 . This is ignited under hydrogen (H 2 ) gas leaving behind pure osmium (Os). 20  Buckminsterfullerene adduct  OsO 4 allowed for the confirmation of the soccer ball model of buckminsterfullerene , a 60 atom carbon  allotrope . The adduct , formed from a derivative of OsO 4 , was C 60 (OsO 4 )(4- tert - butyl pyridine ) 2 . The adduct broke the fullerene's symmetry allowing for crystallization and confirmation of the structure of C 60 by X-ray crystallography . 21  Safety considerations  OsO 4 is highly poisonous, even at low exposure levels, and must be handled with appropriate precautions. In particular, inhalation at concentrations well below those at which a smell can be perceived can lead to pulmonary edema and subsequent death. Noticeable symptoms can take hours to appear after exposure. OsO 4 also stains the human cornea , which can lead to blindness if proper safety precautions are not observed. The permissible exposure limit for osmium(VIII) oxide (8 hour time-weighted average) is 2 µg/m 3 . 22 Osmium(VIII) oxide can penetrate plastics and therefore is stored in glass under refrigeration. 23  On April 6, 2004 British intelligence sources believed they had foiled a plot to detonate a bomb involving OsO 4 . 24 Experts interviewed by New Scientist affirmed osmium(VIII) oxide's toxicity, though some highlighted the difficulties of using it in a weapon: osmium(VIII) oxide is very expensive. The osmium(VIII) oxide may be destroyed by the blast; remaining toxic fumes may also be dispersed by the blast. 25  References  External links   International Chemical Safety Card 0528  NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards  CDC - Osmium Tetroxide - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic  BBC report on bomb plot  BBC What is Osmium tetroxide article  Osmium Tetroxide: Molecule of the Month  Chemical Reactions   "  Category:Osmium compounds  Category:Oxides  Category:Oxidizing agents  Category:Staining dyes  Category:Electron microscopy stains     ↩  Cotton and Wilkinson, Advanced Inorganic Chemistry, p.1002 ↩     {{ cite web | author = Thompson, M. | publisher = Bristol University | title = Osmium tetroxide (OsO 4 ) | url = http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/oso4/oso4h.htm | accessdate = 2012-04-07 }} ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩   ↩  {{ cite journal | author = Christe, K.
