   Stochastic Eulerian Lagrangian method      Stochastic Eulerian Lagrangian method   In computational fluid dynamics , the Stochastic Eulerian Lagrangian Method (SELM) 1 is an approach to capture essential features of fluid-structure interactions subject to thermal fluctuations while introducing approximations which facilitate analysis and the development of tractable numerical methods. SELM is a hybrid approach utilizing an Eulerian description for the continuum hydrodynamic fields and a Lagrangian description for elastic structures. Thermal fluctuations are introduced through stochastic driving fields.  The SELM fluid-structure equations typically used are       ρ    d  u    d  t     =      μ   Δ  u   -   ∇  p    +   Λ   [   Υ   (   V  -   Γ  u    )    ]    +  λ  +    f   t  h  m     (  x  ,  t  )           ρ      d  u     d  t           μ  normal-Δ  u    normal-∇  p      normal-Λ   delimited-[]    normal-Υ    V    normal-Γ  u       λ     subscript  f    t  h  m     x  t       \rho\frac{d{u}}{d{t}}=\mu\,\Delta u-\nabla p+\Lambda[\Upsilon(V-\Gamma{u})]+%
 \lambda+f_{thm}(x,t)          m    d  V    d  t     =     -   Υ   (   V  -   Γ  u    )     -    ∇  Φ    [  X  ]     +  ξ  +   F   t  h  m           m      d  V     d  t             normal-Υ    V    normal-Γ  u         normal-∇  normal-Φ    delimited-[]  X     ξ   subscript  F    t  h  m       m\frac{d{V}}{d{t}}=-\Upsilon(V-\Gamma{u})-\nabla\Phi[X]+\xi+F_{thm}            d  X    d  t    =  V   .          d  X     d  t    V    \frac{d{X}}{d{t}}=V.     The pressure p is determined by the incompressibility condition for the fluid       ∇  ⋅  u   =   0.        normal-⋅  normal-∇  u   0.    \nabla\cdot u=0.\,     The    Γ  ,  Λ     normal-Γ  normal-Λ    \Gamma,\Lambda   operators couple the Eulerian and Lagrangian degrees of freedom. The    X  ,  V     X  V    X,V   denote the composite vectors of the full set of Lagrangian coordinates for the structures. The   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   is the potential energy for a configuration of the structures. The     f   t  h  m    ,   F   t  h  m        subscript  f    t  h  m     subscript  F    t  h  m      f_{thm},F_{thm}   are stochastic driving fields accounting for thermal fluctuations. The    λ  ,  ξ     λ  ξ    \lambda,\xi   are Lagrange multipliers imposing constraints, such as local rigid body deformations . To ensure that dissipation occurs only through the   Υ   normal-Υ   \Upsilon   coupling and not as a consequence of the interconversion by the operators    Γ  ,  Λ     normal-Γ  normal-Λ    \Gamma,\Lambda   the following adjoint conditions are imposed       Γ  =   Λ  T    .      normal-Γ   superscript  normal-Λ  T     \Gamma=\Lambda^{T}.     Thermal fluctuations are introduced through Gaussian random fields with mean zero and the covariance structure        ⟨    f   t  h  m     (  s  )    f   t  h  m   T    (  t  )    ⟩   =   -    (   2   k  B   T   )    (    μ  Δ   -   Λ  Υ  Γ    )   δ   (   t  -  s   )      .       delimited-⟨⟩     subscript  f    t  h  m    s   subscript   superscript  f  T     t  h  m    t          2   subscript  k  B   T       μ  normal-Δ     normal-Λ  normal-Υ  normal-Γ    δ    t  s       \langle f_{thm}(s)f^{T}_{thm}(t)\rangle=-\left(2k_{B}{T}\right)\left(\mu\Delta%
 -\Lambda\Upsilon\Gamma\right)\delta(t-s).           ⟨    F   t  h  m     (  s  )    F   t  h  m   T    (  t  )    ⟩   =   2   k  B   T  Υ  δ   (   t  -  s   )     .       delimited-⟨⟩     subscript  F    t  h  m    s   subscript   superscript  F  T     t  h  m    t      2   subscript  k  B   T  normal-Υ  δ    t  s      \langle F_{thm}(s)F^{T}_{thm}(t)\rangle=2k_{B}{T}\Upsilon\delta(t-s).           ⟨    f   t  h  m     (  s  )    F   t  h  m   T    (  t  )    ⟩   =   -   2   k  B   T  Λ  Υ  δ   (   t  -  s   )      .       delimited-⟨⟩     subscript  f    t  h  m    s   subscript   superscript  F  T     t  h  m    t        2   subscript  k  B   T  normal-Λ  normal-Υ  δ    t  s       \langle f_{thm}(s)F^{T}_{thm}(t)\rangle=-2k_{B}{T}\Lambda\Upsilon\delta(t-s).     To obtain simplified descriptions and efficient numerical methods, approximations in various limiting physical regimes have been considered to remove dynamics on small time-scales or inertial degrees of freedom. In different limiting regimes, the SELM framework can be related to the immersed boundary method , accelerated Stokesian dynamics , and arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian method . The SELM approach has been shown to yield stochastic fluid-structure dynamics that are consistent with statistical mechanics. In particular, the SELM dynamics have been shown to satisfy detailed-balance for the Gibbs–Boltzmann ensemble . Different types of coupling operators have also been introduced allowing for descriptions of structures involving generalized coordinates and additional translational or rotational degrees of freedom.
