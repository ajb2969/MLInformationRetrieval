This value characterizes computer arithmetic in the field of numerical analysis , and by extension in the subject of computational science . The quantity is also called macheps or unit roundoff , and it has the symbols Greek epsilon    ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   or bold Roman u , respectively.  Values for standard hardware floating point arithmetics  The following values of machine epsilon apply to standard floating point formats:      IEEE 754 - 2008   Common name   C++ data type   Base   b   b   b      Precision   p   p   p      Machine epsilon     b   -   (   p  -  1   )     /  2       superscript  b      p  1     2    b^{-(p-1)}/2      Machine epsilon    b   -   (   p  -  1   )       superscript  b      p  1      b^{-(p-1)}          binary16   half precision   short   2   11 (one bit is implicit)   2 −11 = 4.88e-04   2 −10 = 9.77e-04     binary32   single precision   float   2   24 (one bit is implicit)   2 −24 = 5.96e-08   2 −23 = 1.19e-07     binary64   double precision   double   2   53 (one bit is implicit)   2 −53 = 1.11e-16   2 −52 = 2.22e-16     binary80   extended precision   _float80 1   2   64   2 −64 = 5.42e-20   2 −63 = 1.08e-19     binary128   quad(ruple) precision   _float128 2   2   113 (one bit is implicit)   2 −113 = 9.63e-35   2 −112 = 1.93e-34     decimal32   single precision decimal   _Decimal32 3   10   7   5 × 10 −7   10 −6     decimal64   double precision decimal   _Decimal64 4   10   16   5 × 10 −16   10 −15     decimal128   quad(ruple) precision decimal   _Decimal128 5   10   34   5 × 10 −34   10 −33     according to Prof. Demmel, LAPACK , Scilab according to Prof. Higham; ISO C standard; C , C++ and Python language constants; Mathematica , MATLAB and Octave ; various textbooks - see below for the latter definition  Formal definition  Rounding is a procedure for choosing the representation of a real number in a floating point number system. For a number system and a rounding procedure, machine epsilon is the maximum relative error of the chosen rounding procedure.  Some background is needed to determine a value from this definition. A floating point number system is characterized by a radix which is also called the base,   b   b   b   , and by the precision    p   p   p   , i.e. the number of radix   b   b   b   digits of the significand (including any leading implicit bit). All the numbers with the same exponent ,   e   e   e   , have the spacing,    b   e  -   (   p  -  1   )       superscript  b    e    p  1      b^{e-(p-1)}   . The spacing changes at the numbers that are perfect powers of   b   b   b   ; the spacing on the side of larger magnitude is   b   b   b   times larger than the spacing on the side of smaller magnitude.  Since machine epsilon is a bound for relative error, it suffices to consider numbers with exponent    e  =  0      e  0    e=0   . It also suffices to consider positive numbers. For the usual round-to-nearest kind of rounding, the absolute rounding error is at most half the spacing, or     b   -   (   p  -  1   )     /  2       superscript  b      p  1     2    b^{-(p-1)}/2   . This value is the biggest possible numerator for the relative error. The denominator in the relative error is the number being rounded, which should be as small as possible to make the relative error large. The worst relative error therefore happens when rounding is applied to numbers of the form    1  +  a      1  a    1+a   where   a   a   a   is between   0   0    and     b   -   (   p  -  1   )     /  2       superscript  b      p  1     2    b^{-(p-1)}/2   . All these numbers round to   1   1   1   with relative error    a  /   (   1  +  a   )       a    1  a     a/(1+a)   . The maximum occurs when   a   a   a   is at the upper end of its range. The    1  +  a      1  a    1+a   in the denominator is negligible compared to the numerator, so it is left off for expediency, and just     b   -   (   p  -  1   )     /  2       superscript  b      p  1     2    b^{-(p-1)}/2   is taken as machine epsilon. As has been shown here, the relative error is worst for numbers that round to   1   1   1   , so machine epsilon also is called unit roundoff meaning roughly "the maximum error that can occur when rounding to the unit value".  Thus, the maximum spacing between a normalised floating point number,   x   x   x   , and an adjacent normalised number is    2  ϵ      2  ϵ    2\epsilon   x    |  x  |      x    |x|   . 6  Arithmetic model  Numerical analysis uses machine epsilon to study the effects of rounding error. The actual errors of machine arithmetic are far too complicated to be studied directly, so instead, the following simple model is used. The IEEE arithmetic standard says all floating point operations are done as if it were possible to perform the infinite-precision operation, and then, the result is rounded to a floating point number. Suppose (1)   x   x   x   ,   y   y   y   are floating point numbers, (2)   ∙   normal-∙   \bullet   is an arithmetic operation on floating point numbers such as addition or multiplication, and (3)   ∘     \circ   is the infinite precision operation. According to the standard, the computer calculates:       x  ∙  y   =   round   (   x  ∘  y   )         normal-∙  x  y     round    x  y      x\bullet y=\mbox{round}(x\circ y)     By the meaning of machine epsilon, the relative error of the rounding is at most machine epsilon in magnitude, so:       x  ∙  y   =    (   x  ∘  y   )    (   1  +  z   )         normal-∙  x  y       x  y     1  z      x\bullet y=(x\circ y)(1+z)     where   z   z   z   in absolute magnitude is at most   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   or u . The books by Demmel and Higham in the references can be consulted to see how this model is used to analyze the errors of, say, Gaussian elimination.  Variant definitions  The IEEE standard does not define the terms machine epsilon and unit roundoff , so differing definitions of these terms are in use, which can cause some confusion.  The definition given here for machine epsilon is the one used by Prof. James Demmel in lecture scripts 7 and his LAPACK linear algebra package, 8 and by numerics research papers 9 and some scientific computing software. 10 Most numerical analysts use the words machine epsilon and unit roundoff interchangeably with this meaning.  The following different definition is much more widespread outside academia: Machine epsilon is defined as the smallest number that, when added to one, yields a result different from one. By this definition,   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   equals the value of the unit in the last place relative to 1, i.e.    b   -   (   p  -  1   )       superscript  b      p  1      b^{-(p-1)}   , 11 and for the round-to-nearest kind of rounding procedure, u      =   ϵ  /  2       absent    ϵ  2     =\epsilon/2   . The prevalence of this definition is rooted in its use in the ISO C Standard for constants relating to floating-point types 12 13 and corresponding constants in other programming languages. 14 15 It is also widely used in scientific computing software, 16 17 18 in the numerics and computing literature 19 20 21 22 and other academic resources. 23 24  How to determine machine epsilon  Where standard libraries do not provide precomputed values (as  does with FLT_EPSILON , DBL_EPSILON and LDBL_EPSILON for C and  does with std::numeric_limits< T >::epsilon() in C++), the best way to determine machine epsilon is to refer to the table, above, and use the appropriate pow formula. Computing machine epsilon is often given as a textbook exercise. The following examples compute machine epsilon in the sense of the spacing of the floating point numbers at 1 rather than in the sense of the unit roundoff.  Note that results depend on the particular floating-point format used, such as float , double , long double , or similar as supported by the programming language, the compiler, and the runtime library for the actual platform.  Some formats supported by the processor might not be supported by the chosen compiler and operating system. Other formats might be emulated by the runtime library, including arbitrary-precision arithmetic available in some languages and libraries.  In a strict sense the term machine epsilon means the 1+eps accuracy directly supported by the processor (or coprocessor), not some 1+eps accuracy supported by a specific compiler for a specific operating system, unless it's known to use the best format.  IEEE 754 floating-point formats have the property that, when reinterpreted as a two's complement integer of the same width, they monotonically increase over positive values and monotonically decrease over negative values (see the binary representation of 32 bit floats ). They also have the property that 0  typedef union {  long long i64;  double d64;  } dbl_64; double machine_eps (double value) {  dbl_64 s;  s.d64 = value;  s.i64++;  return s.d64 - value;  }  This will give a result of the same sign as value. If a positive result is always desired, the return statement of machine_eps can be replaced with:   return (s.i64 < 0 ? value - s.d64 : s.d64 - value);  64-bit doubles give 2.220446e-16, which is 2 −52 as expected.  Approximation  The following simple algorithm can be used to approximate the machine epsilon, to within a factor of two (one order of magnitude ) of its true value, using a linear search .  epsilon = 1.0;   while (1.0 + 0.5 * epsilon) ≠ 1.0:  epsilon = 0.5 * epsilon  See also   Floating point , general discussion of accuracy issues in floating point arithmetic  Unit in the last place (ULP)   Notes and references   Anderson, E.; LAPACK Users' Guide, Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM), Philadelphia, PA, third edition, 1999.
