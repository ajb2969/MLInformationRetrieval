Golomb ruler

 In mathematics, a Golomb ruler is a set of marks at integer positions along an imaginary ruler such that no two pairs of marks are the same distance apart. The number of marks on the ruler is its order, and the largest distance between two of its marks is its length. Translation and reflection of a Golomb ruler are considered trivial, so the smallest mark is customarily put at 0 and the next mark at the smaller of its two possible values.
The Golomb ruler was named for Solomon W. Golomb and discovered independently by Sidon1 and Babcock.2
There is no requirement that a Golomb ruler be able to measure all distances up to its length, but if it does, it is called a perfect Golomb ruler. It has been proven that no perfect Golomb ruler exists for five or more marks.3 A Golomb ruler is optimal if no shorter Golomb ruler of the same order exists. Creating Golomb rulers is easy, but finding the optimal Golomb ruler (or rulers) for a specified order is computationally very challenging.
Distributed.net has completed distributed massively parallel searches for optimal order-24 through order-27 Golomb rulers, each time confirming the suspected candidate ruler.4567 In February 2014, distributed.net began the search to find optimal Golomb rulers (OGRs) of order-28.
Currently, the complexity of finding OGRs of arbitrary order n (where n is given in unary) is unknown. In the past there was some speculation that it is an NP-hard problem.8 Problems related to the construction of Golomb Rulers are provably shown to be NP-hard, where it is also noted that no known NP-complete problem has similar flavor to finding Golomb Rulers.9

Optimality
A Golomb ruler of order 
 
 
 
  with length n may be optimal in either of two respects:12

it may be optimally dense, exhibiting maximal m for the specific value of n
it may be optimally short, exhibiting minimal n for the specific value of m

The general term optimal Golomb ruler is used to refer to the second type of optimality.
Practical applications

Information theory and error correction
Golomb rulers are used within Information Theory related to error correcting codes.14
Radio frequency selection
Golomb rulers are used in the selection of radio frequencies to reduce the effects of intermodulation interference with both terrestrial15 and extraterrestrial16 applications.
Radio antenna placement
Golomb rulers are used in the design of phased arrays of radio antennas. Antennas in a [0,1,4,6] Golomb ruler configuration can often be seen at AM tower or cell sites. In radio astronomy one-dimensional synthesis arrays can have the antennas in a Golomb ruler configuration in order to obtain minimum redundancy of the Fourier component sampling.1718
Current Transformers
Multi-ratio current transformers use Golomb rulers to place transformer tap points.
Methods of construction
A number of construction methods produce asymptotically optimal Golomb rulers.
Erdős–Turan construction
The following construction, due to Paul Erdős and Pál Turán, produces a Golomb ruler for every odd prime p.19

$2pk+(k^2\,\bmod\,p),k\in[0,p-1]$

The following table contains all known optimal Golomb rulers, excluding those with marks in the reverse order. The first four are perfect.

The optimal ruler would have been known before this date; this date represents that date when it was discovered to be optimal (because all other rulers were proven to not be smaller). For example, the ruler that turned out to be optimal for order 26 was recorded on 10 October 2007, but it was not known to be optimal until all other possibilities were exhausted on 24 February 2009.
