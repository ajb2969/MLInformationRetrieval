   Arcsine laws (Wiener process)      Arcsine laws (Wiener process)   In probability theory , the arcsine laws are a collection of results for one-dimensional random walks and Brownian motion (the Wiener process ). The best known of these is attributed to .  All three laws relate path properties of the Wiener process to the arcsine distribution . A random variable X on [0,1] is arcsine-distributed if        Pr   [   X  ≤  x   ]    =    2  π    arcsin   (   x   )      .       Pr    X  x        2  π       x       \Pr\left[X\leq x\right]=\frac{2}{\pi}\arcsin\left(\sqrt{x}\right).     Statement of the laws  Throughout we suppose that ( W t ) 0  ≤ t ≤ 1 ∈ R is the one-dimensional Wiener process on [0,1]. Scale invariance ensures that the results can be generalised to Wiener processes run for t ∈[0,∞).  First (Lévy's) arcsine law  The first arcsine law states that the proportion of time that the one-dimensional Wiener process is positive follows an arcsine distribution. Let       T  +   =   |   {   t  ∈   [  0  ,  1  ]    :    W  t   >   0    }   |        subscript  T       conditional-set    t   0  1       subscript  W  t   0       T_{+}=\left|\{\,t\in[0,1]\,\colon\,W_{t}>0\,\}\right|     be the measure of the set of times in [0,1] at which the Wiener process is positive. Then    T  +     subscript  T     T_{+}   is arcsine distributed         Pr   [    T  +   ≤  x   ]    =    2  π    arcsin   (   x   )      ,    ∀  x   ∈   [  0  ,  1  ]     .     formulae-sequence     Pr     subscript  T    x        2  π       x         for-all  x    0  1      \Pr\left[T_{+}\leq x\right]=\frac{2}{\pi}\arcsin\left(\sqrt{x}\right),\qquad%
 \forall x\in[0,1].     Second arcsine law  The second arcsine law describes the distribution of the last time the Wiener process changes sign. Let      L  =   sup   {   t  ∈   [  0  ,  1  ]    :    W  t   =  0   }        L   supremum   conditional-set    t   0  1       subscript  W  t   0       L=\sup\left\{t\in[0,1]\,\colon\,W_{t}=0\right\}     be the last time of the last zero. Then L is arcsine distributed.         Pr   [   L  ≤  x   ]    =    2  π    arcsin   (   x   )      ,    ∀  x   ∈   [  0  ,  1  ]     .     formulae-sequence     Pr    L  x        2  π       x         for-all  x    0  1      \Pr\left[L\leq x\right]=\frac{2}{\pi}\arcsin\left(\sqrt{x}\right),\qquad%
 \forall x\in[0,1].     Third arcsine law  The third arcsine law states that the time at which a Wiener process achieves its maximum is arcsine distributed.  The statement of the law relies on the fact that the Wiener process has an almost surely unique maxima, 1 and so we can define the random variable M which is the time at which the maxima is achieved. i.e. the unique M such that        W  M   =   sup   {    W  s    :   s  ∈   [  0  ,  1  ]    }     .       subscript  W  M    supremum   conditional-set   subscript  W  s     s   0  1        W_{M}=\sup\{W_{s}\,\colon\,s\in[0,1]\}.     Then M is arcsine distributed.         Pr   [   M  ≤  x   ]    =    2  π    arcsin   (   x   )      ,    ∀  x   ∈   [  0  ,  1  ]     .     formulae-sequence     Pr    M  x        2  π       x         for-all  x    0  1      \Pr\left[M\leq x\right]=\frac{2}{\pi}\arcsin\left(\sqrt{x}\right),\qquad%
 \forall x\in[0,1].     Equivalence of the second and third laws  Defining the running maximum process M t of the Wiener process        M  t   =   sup   {    W  s    :   s  ∈   [  0  ,  t  ]    }     ,       subscript  M  t    supremum   conditional-set   subscript  W  s     s   0  t        M_{t}=\sup\{W_{s}\,\colon\,s\in[0,t]\},     then the law of X t = M t − W t has the same law as a reflected Wiener process | B t | (where B t is a Wiener process independent of W t ). 2  Since the zeros of B and | B | coincide, the last zero of X has the same distribution as L , the last zero of the Wiener process. The last zero of X occurs exactly when W achieves its maximum. 3 It follows that the second and third laws are equivalent.
