   Brandt semigroup      Brandt semigroup   In mathematics, Brandt semigroups are completely 0-simple inverse semigroups . In other words, they are semigroups without proper ideals and which are also inverse semigroups. They are built in the same way as completely 0-simple semigroups:  Let G be a group and    I  ,  J     I  J    I,J   be non-empty sets. Define a matrix   P   P   P   of dimension     |  I  |   ×   |  J  |         I     J     |I|\times|J|   with entries in      G  0   =   G  ∪   {  0  }     .       superscript  G  0     G   0      G^{0}=G\cup\{0\}.     Then, it can be shown that every 0-simple semigroup is of the form    S  =   (   I  ×   G  0   ×  J   )       S    I   superscript  G  0   J     S=(I\times G^{0}\times J)   with the operation      (  i  ,  a  ,  j  )   *   (  k  ,  b  ,  n  )    =   (  i  ,   a   p   j  k    b   ,  n  )          i  a  j    k  b  n     i    a   subscript  p    j  k    b   n     (i,a,j)*(k,b,n)=(i,ap_{jk}b,n)   .  As Brandt semigroups are also inverse semigroups, the construction is more specialized and in fact, I = J (Howie 1995). Thus, a Brandt semigroup has the form    S  =   (   I  ×   G  0   ×  I   )       S    I   superscript  G  0   I     S=(I\times G^{0}\times I)   with the operation      (  i  ,  a  ,  j  )   *   (  k  ,  b  ,  n  )    =   (  i  ,   a   p   j  k    b   ,  n  )          i  a  j    k  b  n     i    a   subscript  p    j  k    b   n     (i,a,j)*(k,b,n)=(i,ap_{jk}b,n)   .  Moreover, the matrix   P   P   P   is diagonal with only the identity element e of the group G in its diagonal.  Remarks  1) The idempotents have the form (i,e,i) where e is the identity of G  2) There are equivalent way to define the Brandt semigroup. Here is another one:  ac=bc≠0 or ca=cb≠0 ⇒ a=b  ab≠0 and bc≠0 ⇒ abc≠0  If a ≠ 0 then there is unique x , y , z for which xa = a , ay = a , za = y .  For all idempotents e and f nonzero, eSf ≠ 0  See also  Special classes of semigroups  References    .   "  Category:Semigroup theory
