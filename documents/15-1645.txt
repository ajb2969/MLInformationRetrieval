3-O-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-alpha-D-mannopyranose xylosylphosphotransferase

3-O-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-alpha-D-mannopyranose xylosylphosphotransferase (, XPT1) is an enzyme with system name UDP-D-xylose:3-O-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-alpha-D-mannopyranose xylosylphosphotransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

UDP-xylose + 3-O-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-alpha-D-mannopyranose 
 
 
 
  UMP + 3-O-(6-O-alpha-D-xylosylphospho-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl)-alpha-D-mannopyranose
 

Mn2+ required for activity.
