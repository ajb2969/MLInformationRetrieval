Fundamental theorem of linear algebra

In mathematics, the fundamental theorem of linear algebra makes several statements regarding vector spaces. These may be stated concretely in terms of the rank r of an  matrix A and its singular value decomposition:



First, each matrix 
 
 
 
  (
 
 
 
  has 
 
 
 
  rows and 
 
 
 
  columns) induces four fundamental subspaces. These fundamental subspaces are:




name of subspace

definition

containing space

dimension

basis





column space, range or image



 
  or 
 
 








 
  (rank)

The first 
 
 
 
  columns of 
 
 




nullspace or kernel



 
  or 
 
 








 
  (nullity)

The last 
 
 
 
  columns of 
 
 




row space or coimage



 
  or 
 
 








 
  (rank)

The first 
 
 
 
  columns of 
 
 




left nullspace or cokernel



 
  or 
 
 








 
  (corank)

The last 
 
 
 
  columns of 
 
 




Secondly:

In 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , that is, the nullspace is the orthogonal complement of the row space
In 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , that is, the left nullspace is the orthogonal complement of the column space.

The dimensions of the subspaces are related by the rank–nullity theorem, and follow from the above theorem.
Further, all these spaces are intrinsically defined—they do not require a choice of basis—in which case one rewrites this in terms of abstract vector spaces, operators, and the dual spaces as 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 : the kernel and image of 
 
 
 
  are the cokernel and coimage of 
 
 
 
 .
