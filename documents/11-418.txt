   4-nitrophenylphosphatase      4-nitrophenylphosphatase   In enzymology , a 4-nitrophenylphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-nitrophenyl phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-nitrophenol + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-nitrophenyl phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 4-nitrophenol and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-nitrophenylphosphate phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include nitrophenyl phosphatase , p-nitrophenylphosphatase , para-nitrophenyl phosphatase , K-pNPPase , NPPase , PNPPase , Ecto-p-nitrophenyl phosphatase , and p-nitrophenylphosphate phosphohydrolase . This enzyme participates in gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane degradation .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
