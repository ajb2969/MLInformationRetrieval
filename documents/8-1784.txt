Rellich–Kondrachov theorem

In mathematics, the Rellich–Kondrachov theorem is a compact embedding theorem concerning Sobolev spaces. It is named after the Italian-Austrian mathematician Franz Rellich and the Russian mathematician Vladimir Iosifovich Kondrashov. Rellich proved the L2 theorem and Kondrachov the Lp theorem.
Statement of the theorem
Let Ω ⊆ Rn be an open, bounded Lipschitz domain, and let 1 ≤ p p^{*} := \frac{n p}{n - p}.
Then the Sobolev space W1,p(Ω; R) is continuously embedded in the Lp space Lp∗(Ω; R) and is compactly embedded in Lq(Ω; R) for every 1 ≤ q ∗. In symbols,



and



Kondrachov embedding theorem
On a compact manifold with  boundary, the Kondrachov embedding theorem states that if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then the Sobolev embedding



is completely continuous (compact).
Consequences
Since an embedding is compact if and only if the inclusion (identity) operator is a compact operator, the Rellich–Kondrachov theorem implies that any uniformly bounded sequence in W1,p(Ω; R) has a subsequence that converges in Lq(Ω; R). Stated in this form, the result is sometimes known as the Rellich-Kondrachov selection theorem (since one "selects" a convergent subsequence).
The Rellich–Kondrachov theorem may be used to prove the Poincaré inequality,1 which states that for u ∈ W1,p(Ω; R) (where Ω satisfies the same hypotheses as above),



for some constant C depending only on p and the geometry of the domain Ω, where



denotes the mean value of u over Ω.
