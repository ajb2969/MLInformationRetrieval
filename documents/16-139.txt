3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine reductive deaminase

3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine reductive deaminase (, reductive deaminase, DOPA-reductive deaminase, DOPARDA) is an enzyme with system name 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropanoate-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

L-dopa + 2 NADH 
 
 
 
  3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropanoate + 2 NAD+ + NH3


This enzyme participates in the L-phenylalanine-catabolism in the anaerobic phototrophic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides OU5.
