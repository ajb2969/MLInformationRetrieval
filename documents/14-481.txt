Quasisymmetric function




Quasisymmetric function

In algebra and in particular in algebraic combinatorics, a quasisymmetric function is any element in the ring of quasisymmetric functions which is in turn a subring of the formal power series ring with a countable number of variables. This ring generalizes the ring of symmetric functions. This ring can be realized as a specific limit of the rings of quasisymmetric polynomials in n variables, as n goes to infinity. This ring serves as universal structure in which relations between quasisymmetric polynomials can be expressed in a way independent of the number n of variables (but its elements are neither polynomials nor functions).
Definitions
The ring of quasisymmetric functions, denoted QSym, can be defined over any commutative ring R such as the integers. Quasisymmetric functions are power series of bounded degree in variables 
 
 
 
  with coefficients in R, which are shift invariant in the sense that the coefficient of the monomial 
 
 
 
  is equal to the coefficient of the monomial 
 
 
 
  for any strictly increasing sequence of positive integers 
 
 
 
  indexing the variables and any positive integer sequence 
 
 
 
  of exponents.1 Much of the study of quasisymmetric functions is based on that of symmetric functions.
A quasisymmetric function in finitely many variables is a quasisymmetric polynomial. Both symmetric and quasisymmetric polynomials may be characterized in terms of actions of the symmetric group

 
  on a polynomial ring in 
 
 
 
  variables 
 
 
 
 . One such action of 
 
 
 
  permutes variables, changing a polynomial 
 
 
 
  by iteratively swapping pairs 
 
 
 
  of variables having consecutive indices. Those polynomials unchanged by all such swaps form the subring of symmetric polynomials. A second action of 
 
 
 
  conditionally permutes variables, changing a polynomial 
 
 
 
  by swapping pairs 
 
 
 
  of variables except in monomials containing both variables. Those polynomials unchanged by all such conditional swaps form the subring of quasisymmetric polynomials. One quasisymmetric function in four variables is the polynomial



The simplest symmetric function containing all of these monomials is



Important bases
QSym is a graded R-algebra, decomposing as



where 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
 
 -span of all quasisymmetric functions that are homogeneous of degree 
 
 
 
 . Two natural bases for 
 
 
 
  are the monomial basis

 
  and the fundamental basis

 
  indexed by compositions

 
  of 
 
 
 
 , denoted 
 
 
 
 . The monomial basis consists of 
 
 
 
  and all formal power series



The fundamental basis consists 
 
 
 
  and all formal power series



where 
 
 
 
  means we can obtain 
 
 
 
  by adding together adjacent parts of 
 
 
 
 , for example, (3,2,4,2)
 
 
 
  (3,1,1,1,2,1,2). Thus, when the ring 
 
 
 
  is the ring of rational numbers, one has



Then one can define the algebra of symmetric functions

 
  as the subalgebra of QSym spanned by the monomial symmetric functions

 
  and all formal power series 
 
 
 
  where the sum is over all compositions 
 
 
 
  which rearrange to the partition

 
 . Moreover, we have 
 
 
 
 . For example, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

Other important bases for quasisymmetric functions include the basis of quasisymmetric Schur functions,2 and bases related to enumeration in matroids.34
Applications
Quasisymmetric functions have been applied in enumerative combinatorics, symmetric function theory, representation theory, and number theory. Applications of quasisymmetric functions include enumeration of P-partitions,56 permutations,78910 tableaux,11 chains of posets,1213 reduced decompositions in finite Coxeter groups (via Stanley symmetric functions),14 and parking functions.15 In symmetric function theory and representation theory, applications include the study of Schubert polynomials,1617 Macdonald polynomials,18 Hecke algebras,19 and Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials.20 Often quasisymmetric functions provide a powerful bridge between combinatorial structures and symmetric functions.
Related algebras
As a graded Hopf algebra, the dual of the ring of quasisymmetric functions is the ring of noncommutative symmetric functions. Every symmetric function is also a quasisymmetric function, and hence the ring of symmetric functions is a subalgebra of the ring of quasisymmetric functions.
The ring of quasisymmetric functions is the terminal object in category of graded Hopf algebras with a single character.21 Hence any such Hopf algebra has a morphism to the ring of quasisymmetric functions.
One example of this is the peak algebra.22
Other Related Algebras: The Malvenuto-Reutenauer algebra23 is a Hopf algebra based on permutations that relates the rings of symmetric functions, quasisymmetric functions, and noncommutative symmetric functions, (denoted Sym, QSym, and NSym respectively), as depicted the following commutative diagram. The duality between QSym and NSym mentioned above is reflected in the main diagonal of this diagram.

Many related Hopf algebras were constructed from Hopf monoids in the category of species by Aguiar and Majahan .24
One can also construct the ring of quasisymmetric functions in noncommuting variables.2526
