   Dehydro-L-gulonate decarboxylase      Dehydro-L-gulonate decarboxylase   In enzymology , a dehydro-L-gulonate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-dehydro-L-gulonate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-xylulose + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 3-dehydro-L-gulonate , and two products , L-xylulose and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-dehydro-L-gulonate carboxy-lyase (L-xylulose-forming) . Other names in common use include keto-L-gulonate decarboxylase , 3-keto-L-gulonate decarboxylase , and 3-dehydro-L-gulonate carboxy-lyase . This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions .  References     "  Category:EC 4.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
