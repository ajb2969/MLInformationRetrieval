   Glycyrrhizinate beta-glucuronidase      Glycyrrhizinate beta-glucuronidase   In enzymology , a glycyrrhizinate beta-glucuronidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   glycyrrhizinate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1,2-beta-D-glucuronosyl-D-glucuronate + glycyrrhetinate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are glycyrrhizinate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 1,2-beta-D-glucuronosyl-D-glucuronate and glycyrrhetinate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , to be specific those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glycyrrhizinate glucuronosylhydrolase . Other names in common use include glycyrrhizin beta-hydrolase , glycyrrhizin hydrolase , and glycyrrhizinic acid hydrolase .
