It is more precisely called the principal square root of 3 , to distinguish it from the negative number with the same property. It is denoted by       3   .      3    \sqrt{3}.     The first sixty digits of its decimal expansion are:   1.73205 08075 68877 29352 74463 41505 87236 69428 05253 81038 06280 5580...   As of December 2013, its numerical value in decimal has been computed to at least ten billion digits. 1 The rounded value of 1.732 is correct to within 0.01% of the actual value. A close fraction is    97  56      97  56    \tfrac{97}{56}   (1.732142857...).  Archimedes reported (1351/780) 2 > 3 > (265/153) 2 , 2 accurate to 1/608400 (6-places) and 2/23409 (4-places), respectively.  The square root of 3 is an irrational number . It is also known as Theodorus' constant , named after Theodorus of Cyrene .  It can be expressed as the continued fraction [1; 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, ...] , expanded on the right.  It can also be expressed by generalized continued fractions such as       [  2  ;   -  4   ,   -  4   ,   -  4   ,  …  ]   =   2  -   1   4  -    1   4  -    1   4  -  ⋱                2    4     4     4   normal-…     2   continued-fraction  1    4   continued-fraction  1    4   continued-fraction  1    4  normal-⋱           [2;-4,-4,-4,...]=2-\cfrac{1}{4-\cfrac{1}{4-\cfrac{1}{4-\ddots}}}     which is [1;1, 2,1, 2,1, 2,1, ...] evaluated at every second term.  Proof of irrationality  This irrationality proof for the square root of 3 uses Fermat 's method of infinite descent :  Suppose that    3      3    \sqrt{3}   is rational, and express it in lowest possible terms (i.e., as a fully reduced fraction ) as    m  n      m  n    \frac{m}{n}   for natural numbers   m   m   m   and   n   n   n   .  Therefore, multiplying by 1 will give an equal expression:       m   (    3   -  q   )     n   (    3   -  q   )          m      3   q      n      3   q      \frac{m(\sqrt{3}-q)}{n(\sqrt{3}-q)}   where   q   q   q   is the largest integer smaller than    3      3    \sqrt{3}   . Note that both the numerator and the denominator have been multiplied by a number smaller than 1.  Through this, and by multiplying out both the numerator and the denominator, we get:        m   3    -   m  q      n   3    -   n  q            m    3      m  q        n    3      n  q      \frac{m\sqrt{3}-mq}{n\sqrt{3}-nq}     It follows that   m   m   m   can be replaced with     3   n        3   n    \sqrt{3}n   :        n    3   2    -   m  q      n   3    -   n  q            n   superscript    3   2      m  q        n    3      n  q      \frac{n\sqrt{3}^{2}-mq}{n\sqrt{3}-nq}     Then,    3      3    \sqrt{3}   can also be replaced with    m  n      m  n    \frac{m}{n}   in the denominator:        n    3   2    -   m  q      n   m  n    -   n  q            n   superscript    3   2      m  q        n    m  n      n  q      \frac{n\sqrt{3}^{2}-mq}{n\frac{m}{n}-nq}     The square of    3      3    \sqrt{3}   can be replaced by 3. As    m  n      m  n    \frac{m}{n}   is multiplied by   n   n   n   , their product equals   m   m   m   :        3  n   -   m  q     m  -   n  q            3  n     m  q      m    n  q      \frac{3n-mq}{m-nq}     Then    3      3    \sqrt{3}   can be expressed in lower terms than    m  /  n      m  n    m/n   (since the first step reduced the sizes of both the numerator and the denominator, and subsequent steps did not change them) as      3  n   -   m  q     m  -   n  q            3  n     m  q      m    n  q      \frac{3n-mq}{m-nq}   , which is a contradiction to the hypothesis that    m  /  n      m  n    m/n   was in lowest terms. 3  An alternate proof of this is, assuming     3   =   m  n         3     m  n     \sqrt{3}=\frac{m}{n}   with    m  n      m  n    \frac{m}{n}   being a fully reduced fraction :  Multiplying by   n   n   n   both terms, and then squaring both gives        3   n  2    =   m  2    .        3   superscript  n  2     superscript  m  2     3n^{2}=m^{2}.     Since the left side is divisible by 3, so is the right side, requiring that   m   m   m   be divisible by 3. Then,   m   m   m   can be expressed as    3  k      3  k    3k   :       3   n  2    =    (   3  k   )   2         3   superscript  n  2     superscript    3  k   2     3n^{2}=(3k)^{2}          3   n  2    =   9   k  2          3   superscript  n  2      9   superscript  k  2      3n^{2}=9k^{2}     Therefore, dividing both terms by 3 gives:       n  2   =   3   k  2         superscript  n  2     3   superscript  k  2      n^{2}=3k^{2}     Since the right side is divisible by 3, so is the left side and hence so is   n   n   n   . Thus, as both   n   n   n   and   m   m   m   are divisible by 3, they have a common factor and    m  /  n      m  n    m/n   is not a fully reduced fraction, contradicting the original premise.  Geometry and trigonometry    The square root of 3 can be found as the leg length of an equilateral triangle that encompasses a circle with a diameter of 1.  If an equilateral triangle with sides of length 1 is cut into two equal halves, by bisecting an internal angle across to make a right angle with one side, the right angle triangle's hypotenuse is length one and the sides are of length 1/2 and    3      3    \sqrt{3}   /2. From this the trigonometric function tangent of 60 degrees equals    3      3    \sqrt{3}   , and the sine of 60° and the cosine of 30° both equal half of    3      3    \sqrt{3}   .  The square root of 3 also appears in algebraic expressions for various other trigonometric constants , including 4 the sines of 3°, 12°, 15°, 21°, 24°, 33°, 39°, 48°, 51°, 57°, 66°, 69°, 75°, 78°, 84°, and 87°.  It is the distance between parallel sides of a regular hexagon with sides of length 1. On the complex plane , this distance is expressed as   i   i   i       3      3    \sqrt{3}   mentioned below .  It is the length of the space diagonal of a unit cube .  The vesica piscis has a major axis: minor axis ratio equal to the square root of three, this can be shown by constructing two equilateral triangles within it.  Square root of −3  Multiplication of    3      3    \sqrt{3}   by the imaginary unit gives a square root of , an imaginary number . More exactly,        -  3    =   ±    3   i            3     plus-or-minus      3   i      \sqrt{-3}=\pm\sqrt{3}i   (see square root of negative numbers ). It is an Eisenstein integer . Namely, it is expressed as the difference between two non-real cubic roots of 1 (which are Eisenstein integers).  Other uses  Power engineering  In power engineering , the voltage between two phases in a three-phase system equals    3      3    \sqrt{3}   times the line to neutral voltage. This is because any two phases are 120 degrees apart, and two points on a circle 120 degrees apart are separated by    3      3    \sqrt{3}   times the radius (see geometry examples above).
