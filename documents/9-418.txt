The square root of 3 is the positive real number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the number 3. It is more precisely called the principal square root of 3, to distinguish it from the negative number with the same property. It is denoted by



The first sixty digits of its decimal expansion are:

1.73205 08075 68877 29352 74463 41505 87236 69428 05253 81038 06280 5580... 
 

As of December 2013, its numerical value in decimal has been computed to at least ten billion digits.1 The rounded value of 1.732 is correct to within 0.01% of the actual value. A close fraction is 
 
 
 
  (1.732142857...).
Archimedes reported (1351/780)2 > 3 > (265/153)2,2 accurate to 1/608400 (6-places) and 2/23409 (4-places), respectively.
The square root of 3 is an irrational number. It is also known as Theodorus' constant, named after Theodorus of Cyrene.
It can be expressed as the continued fraction [1; 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, ...] , expanded on the right.
It can also be expressed by generalized continued fractions such as



which is [1;1, 2,1, 2,1, 2,1, ...] evaluated at every second term.
Proof of irrationality
This irrationality proof for the square root of 3 uses Fermat's method of infinite descent:
Suppose that 
 
 
 
  is rational, and express it in lowest possible terms (i.e., as a fully reduced fraction) as 
 
 
 
  for natural numbers 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Therefore, multiplying by 1 will give an equal expression:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the largest integer smaller than 
 
 
 
 . Note that both the numerator and the denominator have been multiplied by a number smaller than 1.
Through this, and by multiplying out both the numerator and the denominator, we get:



It follows that 
 
 
 
  can be replaced with 
 
 
 
 :



Then, 
 
 
 
  can also be replaced with 
 
 
 
  in the denominator:



The square of 
 
 
 
  can be replaced by 3. As 
 
 
 
  is multiplied by 
 
 
 
 , their product equals 
 
 
 
 :



Then 
 
 
 
  can be expressed in lower terms than 
 
 
 
  (since the first step reduced the sizes of both the numerator and the denominator, and subsequent steps did not change them) as 
 
 
 
 , which is a contradiction to the hypothesis that 
 
 
 
  was in lowest terms.3
An alternate proof of this is, assuming 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  being a fully reduced fraction:
Multiplying by 
 
 
 
  both terms, and then squaring both gives



Since the left side is divisible by 3, so is the right side, requiring that 
 
 
 
  be divisible by 3. Then, 
 
 
 
  can be expressed as 
 
 
 
 :






Therefore, dividing both terms by 3 gives:



Since the right side is divisible by 3, so is the left side and hence so is 
 
 
 
 . Thus, as both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are divisible by 3, they have a common factor and 
 
 
 
  is not a fully reduced fraction, contradicting the original premise.
Geometry and trigonometry
 
The square root of 3 can be found as the leg length of an equilateral triangle that encompasses a circle with a diameter of 1.
If an equilateral triangle with sides of length 1 is cut into two equal halves, by bisecting an internal angle across to make a right angle with one side, the right angle triangle's hypotenuse is length one and the sides are of length 1/2 and 
 
 
 
 /2. From this the trigonometric function tangent of 60 degrees equals 
 
 
 
 , and the sine of 60° and the cosine of 30° both equal half of 
 
 
 
 .
The square root of 3 also appears in algebraic expressions for various other trigonometric constants, including4 the sines of 3°, 12°, 15°, 21°, 24°, 33°, 39°, 48°, 51°, 57°, 66°, 69°, 75°, 78°, 84°, and 87°.
It is the distance between parallel sides of a regular hexagon with sides of length 1. On the complex plane, this distance is expressed as 
 
 

 
  mentioned below.
It is the length of the space diagonal of a unit cube.
The vesica piscis has a major axis: minor axis ratio equal to the square root of three, this can be shown by constructing two equilateral triangles within it.
Square root of −3
Multiplication of 
 
 
 
  by the imaginary unit gives a square root of , an imaginary number. More exactly,


 
  (see square root of negative numbers). It is an Eisenstein integer. Namely, it is expressed as the difference between two non-real cubic roots of 1 (which are Eisenstein integers).

Power engineering
In power engineering, the voltage between two phases in a three-phase system equals 
 
 
 
  times the line to neutral voltage. This is because any two phases are 120 degrees apart, and two points on a circle 120 degrees apart are separated by 
 
 
 
  times the radius (see geometry examples above).
