   Biotin—(propionyl-CoA-carboxylase (ATP-hydrolyzing)) ligase      Biotin—(propionyl-CoA-carboxylase (ATP-hydrolyzing)) ligase   In enzymology , a biotin-[propionyl-CoA-carboxylase (ATP-hydrolysing)] ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + biotin + apo- propionyl-CoA:carbon-dioxide ligase (ADP-forming)    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + propionyl-CoA:carbon-dioxide ligase (ADP-forming)    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , biotin , and apo-[propionyl-CoA:carbon-dioxide ligase (ADP-forming) , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and propionyl-CoA:carbon-dioxide ligase (ADP-forming) .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming generic carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is biotin:apo-[propanoyl-CoA:carbon-dioxide ligase (ADP-forming)] ligase (AMP-forming) . Other names in common use include biotin-[propionyl-CoA-carboxylase (ATP-hydrolysing)] synthetase , biotin-propionyl coenzyme A carboxylase synthetase , and propionyl coenzyme A holocarboxylase synthetase . This enzyme participates in biotin metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 6.3.4  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
