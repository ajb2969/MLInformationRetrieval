   Interval (mathematics)      Interval (mathematics)   In mathematics , an ( real ) interval is a set of real numbers with the property that any number that lies between two numbers in the set is also included in the set. For example, the set of all numbers   x   x   x   satisfying    0  ≤  x  ≤  1      0  normal-≤  x  normal-≤  1    0≤x≤1   is an interval which contains   0   0    and   1   1   1   , as well as all numbers between them. Other examples of intervals are the set of all real numbers    \R    \R   \R   , the set of all negative real numbers, and the empty set .  Real intervals play an important role in the theory of integration , because they are the simplest sets whose "size" or "measure" or "length" is easy to define. The concept of measure can then be extended to more complicated sets of real numbers, leading to the Borel measure and eventually to the Lebesgue measure .  Intervals are central to interval arithmetic , a general numerical computing technique that automatically provides guaranteed enclosures for arbitrary formulas, even in the presence of uncertainties, mathematical approximations, and arithmetic roundoff .  Intervals are likewise defined on an arbitrary totally ordered set, such as integers or rational numbers . The notation of integer intervals is considered in the special section below .  Notations for intervals  The interval of numbers between   a   a   a   and   b   b   b   , including   a   a   a   and   b   b   b   , is often denoted    [  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    [a,b]   . The two numbers are called the endpoints of the interval. In countries where numbers are written with a decimal comma , a semicolon may be used as a separator, to avoid ambiguity.  Including or excluding endpoints  To indicate that one of the endpoints is to be excluded from the set, the corresponding square bracket can be either replaced with a parenthesis, or reversed. Both notations are described in International standard  ISO 31-11 . Thus, in set builder notation ,      (  a  ,  a  )     a  a    (a,a)   :   empty     [  a  ,  a  ]   =   {  a  }        a  a    a     [a,a]=\{a\}     degenerate     [  a  ,  b  ]   =   {   x   |   a  ≤  x  ≤  b   }        a  b    conditional-set  x      a  x       b       [a,b]=\{x\,|\,a\leq x\leq b\}     proper and bounded:  open: (a,b)=\{x\,|\,a   closed     (  a  ,  ∞  )   =   {    x    |  x  >   a   }        a       x   ket  x   a      (a,\infty)=\{x\,|\,x>a\}     left-closed, right-open: [a,b)=\{x\,|\,a\,\leq x   left-open, right-closed: (a,b]=\{x\,|\,a    left-bounded and right-unbounded:  left-open     [  a  ,  ∞  )   =   {   x   |   x  ≥  a   }        a     conditional-set  x    x  a      [a,\infty)=\{x\,|\,x\geq a\}     left-closed     (   -  ∞   ,  b  ]   =   {   x   |   x  ≤  b   }            b    conditional-set  x    x  b      (-\infty,b]=\{x\,|\,x\leq b\}       left-unbounded and right-bounded:  right-open: (-\infty,b)=\{x\,|\,x   right-closed     (   -  ∞   ,   +  ∞   )   =   \R                 \R    (-\infty,+\infty)=\R       unbounded at both ends    −  ∞      normal-−  normal-∞    −∞      Intervals of the extended real line  In some contexts, an interval may be defined as a subset of the extended real numbers , the set of all real numbers augmented with    +  ∞      normal-∞    +∞   and    [   −  ∞   ,  b  ]       normal-−  normal-∞   b    [−∞,b]   .  In this interpretation, the notations    [   −  ∞   ,  b  )       normal-−  normal-∞   b    [−∞,b)   ,    [  a  ,    +  ∞   ]     a    normal-  normal-∞     [a, +∞]   ,    (  a  ,    +  ∞   ]     a    normal-  normal-∞     (a, +∞]   , and    (   −  ∞   ,    +  ∞   )       normal-−  normal-∞     normal-  normal-∞     (−∞, +∞)   are all meaningful and distinct. In particular,    [   −  ∞   ,    +  ∞   ]       normal-−  normal-∞     normal-  normal-∞     [−∞, +∞]   denotes the set of all ordinary real numbers, while    (   −  ∞   ,    +  ∞   )       normal-−  normal-∞     normal-  normal-∞     (−∞, +∞)   denotes the extended reals.  This choice affects some of the above definitions and terminology. For instance, the interval    \R    \R   \R   =    \R    \R   \R   is closed in the realm of ordinary reals, but not in the realm of the extended reals.  Properties of intervals  The intervals are precisely the connected subsets of    \R    \R   \R   . It follows that the image of an interval by any continuous function is also an interval. This is one formulation of the intermediate value theorem .  The intervals are also the convex subsets of    X  ⊆   \R       X  \R    X\subseteq\R   . The interval enclosure of a subset   X   X   X   is also the convex hull of      (  a  ,  b  )   ∪   [  b  ,  c  ]    =   (  a  ,  c  ]          a  b    b  c     a  c     (a,b)\cup[b,c]=(a,c]   .  The intersection of any collection of intervals is always an interval. The union of two intervals is an interval if and only if they have a non-empty intersection or an open end-point of one interval is a closed end-point of the other (e.g.,    \R    \R   \R   ).  If    (   c  +  r   ,   c  −  r   )       c  r     c  normal-−  r     (c+r,c−r)   is viewed as a metric space , its open balls are the open bounded sets    [   c  +  r   ,   c  −  r   ]       c  r     c  normal-−  r     [c+r,c−r]   , and its closed balls are the closed bounded sets   x   x   x   .  Any element   I   I   I   of an interval   I   I   I   defines a partition of   I   I   I   into three disjoint intervals   I   I   I    1 ,   I   I   I    2 ,   I   I   I    3 : respectively, the elements of   x   x   x   that are less than     [  x  ,  x  ]   =   {  x  }        x  x    x     [x,x]=\{x\}   , the singleton   x   x   x   , and the elements that are greater than   I   I   I   . The parts   I   I   I    1 and   x   x   x    3 are both non-empty (and have non-empty interiors) if and only if   I   I   I   is in the interior of    j   2  n       j   superscript  2  n     \frac{j}{2^{n}}   . This is an interval version of the trichotomy principle .  Dyadic intervals  A dyadic interval is a bounded real interval whose endpoints are     j  +  1    2  n         j  1    superscript  2  n     \frac{j+1}{2^{n}}   and   j   j   j   , where   n   n   n   and    p  =  2      p  2    p=2   are integers. Depending on the context, either endpoint may or may not be included in the interval.  Dyadic intervals have the following properties:   The length of a dyadic interval is always an integer power of two.  Each dyadic interval is contained in exactly one dyadic interval of twice the length.  Each dyadic interval is spanned by two dyadic intervals of half the length.  If two open dyadic intervals overlap, then one of them is a subset of the other.   The dyadic intervals consequently have a structure that reflects that of an infinite binary tree .  Dyadic intervals are relevant to several areas of numerical analysis, including adaptive mesh refinement , multigrid methods and wavelet analysis . Another way to represent such a structure is p-adic analysis (for   n   n   n   ). 1  Generalizations  Multi-dimensional intervals  In many contexts, an      \R   n     superscript  \R  n    \R^{n}   -dimensional interval is defined as a subset of   n   n   n   that is the Cartesian product of    I  =    I  1   ×   I  2   ×  ⋯  ×   I  n        I     subscript  I  1    subscript  I  2   normal-⋯   subscript  I  n      I=I_{1}\times I_{2}\times\cdots\times I_{n}   intervals,    n  =  2      n  2    n=2   , one on each coordinate axis.  For    n  =  3      n  3    n=3   , this generally defines a rectangle whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes; for   I   I   I   , it defines an axis-aligned rectangular box.  A facet of such an interval    I  k     subscript  I  k    I_{k}   is the result of replacing any non-degenerate interval factor    I  k     subscript  I  k    I_{k}   by a degenerate interval consisting of a finite endpoint of   I   I   I   . The faces of   I   I   I   comprise   I   I   I   itself and all faces of its facets. The corners of     \R   n     superscript  \R  n    \R^{n}   are the faces that consist of a single point of    R  ⊕  R     direct-sum  R  R    R\oplus R   .  Complex intervals  Intervals of complex numbers can be defined as regions of the complex plane , either rectangular or circular . 2  Topological algebra  Intervals can be associated with points of the plane and hence regions of intervals can be associated with regions of the plane. Generally, an interval in mathematics corresponds to an ordered pair ( x,y ) taken from the direct product R × R of real numbers with itself. Often it is assumed that y > x . For purposes of mathematical structure , this restriction is discarded, 3 and "reversed intervals" where y − x ( R \oplus R, +, \times) has two ideals , { [ x ,0] : x ∈ R } and { [0, y ] : y ∈ R }. The identity element of this algebra is the condensed interval [1,1]. If interval [ x,y ] is not in one of the ideals, then it has multiplicative inverse [1/ x , 1/ y ]. Endowed with the usual topology , the algebra of intervals forms a topological ring . The group of units of this ring consists of four quadrants determined by the axes, or ideals in this case. The identity component of this group is quadrant I.  Every interval can be considered a symmetric interval around its midpoint . In a reconfiguration published in 1956 by M Warmus, the axis of "balanced intervals" [ x , − x ] is used along with the axis of intervals [ x,x ] that reduce to a point. Instead of the direct sum $R \oplus R$ , the ring of intervals has been identified 4 with the split-complex number plane by M. Warmus and D. H. Lehmer through the identification   z = ( x + y )/2 + j ( x − y )/2.   This linear mapping of the plane, which amounts of a ring isomorphism , provides the plane with a multiplicative structure having some analogies to ordinary complex arithmetic, such as polar decomposition .
