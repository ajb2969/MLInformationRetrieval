Little q-Jacobi polynomials

In mathematics, the little q-Jacobi polynomials pn(x;a,b;q) are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme, introduced by .  give a detailed list of their properties.
Definition
The little q-Jacobi polynomials are given in terms of basic hypergeometric functions and the Pochhammer symbol by
