   Little q-Jacobi polynomials      Little q-Jacobi polynomials   In mathematics, the little q-Jacobi polynomials  p n ( x ; a , b ; q ) are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme , introduced by .  give a detailed list of their properties.  Definition  The little q -Jacobi polynomials are given in terms of basic hypergeometric functions and the Pochhammer symbol by        p  n    (  x  ;  a  ,  b  ;  q  )    =    ϕ  1    2     (   q   -  n    ,   a  b   q   n  +  1     ;   a  q   ;  q  ,   x  q   )           subscript  p  n    x  a  b  q       subscript   subscript  ϕ  1   2     superscript  q    n      a  b   superscript  q    n  1       a  q   q    x  q       \displaystyle p_{n}(x;a,b;q)={}_{2}\phi_{1}(q^{-n},abq^{n+1};aq;q,xq)     Orthogonality  Recurrence and difference relations  Rodrigues formula  Generating function  Relation to other polynomials  Gallery  The following are a set of animation plots for Little q-Jacobi polynomials, with varying q; three density plots of imaginary, real and modula in complex space; three set of complex 3D plots of imaginary, real and modulus of the said polynomials.
