   Cell-free marginal layer model      Cell-free marginal layer model   In small capillary  hemodynamics , the cell-free layer is a near-wall layer of plasma absent of red blood cells since they are subject to migration to the capillary  center in Poiseuille flow . 1 Cell-free marginal layer model is a mathematical model which tries to explain Fåhræus–Lindqvist effect mathematically.  Mathematical modeling  Governing equations  Consider steady flow of blood through a capillary of radius    R   R   R   . The capillary cross section can be divided into a core region and cell-free plasma region near the wall. The governing equations for both regions can be given by the following equations: 2         -   Δ  P    L   =    1  r    d   d  r     (    μ  c   r    d   u  c     d  r     )     ;            normal-Δ  P    L       1  r     d    d  r       subscript  μ  c   r      d   subscript  u  c      d  r        \frac{-\Delta P}{L}=\frac{1}{r}\frac{d}{dr}(\mu_{c}r\frac{du_{c}}{dr});       0  ≤   r   ≤   R  -   δ          0  r         R  δ      0\leq r\ \leq R-\delta\,            -   Δ  P    L   =    1  r    d   d  r     (    μ  p   r    d   u  p     d  r     )     ;            normal-Δ  P    L       1  r     d    d  r       subscript  μ  p   r      d   subscript  u  p      d  r        \frac{-\Delta P}{L}=\frac{1}{r}\frac{d}{dr}(\mu_{p}r\frac{du_{p}}{dr});        R  -  δ   ≤   r   ≤   R           R  δ   r       R     R-\delta\leq r\ \leq R\ \,     where:      Δ  P      normal-Δ  P    \Delta P   is the pressure drop across the capillary     L   L   L   is the length of capillary      u  c     subscript  u  c    u_{c}   is velocity in core region      u  p     subscript  u  p    u_{p}   is velocity of plasma in cell-free region      μ  c     subscript  μ  c    \mu_{c}   is viscosity in core region      μ  p     subscript  μ  p    \mu_{p}   is viscosity of plasma in cell-free region     δ   δ   \delta   is the cell-free plasma layer thickness  Boundary conditions  The boundary conditions to obtain the solution for the two differential equations presented above are that the velocity gradient is zero in the tube center, no slip occurs at the tube wall and the velocity and the shear stress are continuous at the interface between the two zones. These boundary conditions can be expressed mathematically as:           d   u  c     d  r    |    r  =  0    =  0       evaluated-at      d   subscript  u  c      d  r      r  0    0    \left.\frac{du_{c}}{dr}\right|_{r=0}=0              u  p   |    r  =  R    =  0       evaluated-at   subscript  u  p     r  R    0    \left.u_{p}\right|_{r=R}=0              u  p   |    r  =   R  -  δ     =     u  c   |    r  =   R  -  δ          evaluated-at   subscript  u  p     r    R  δ      evaluated-at   subscript  u  c     r    R  δ       \left.u_{p}\right|_{r=R-\delta}=\left.u_{c}\right|_{r=R-\delta}              τ  p   |    r  =   R  -  δ     =     τ  c   |    r  =   R  -  δ          evaluated-at   subscript  τ  p     r    R  δ      evaluated-at   subscript  τ  c     r    R  δ       \left.\tau_{p}\right|_{r=R-\delta}=\left.\tau_{c}\right|_{r=R-\delta}      Velocity profiles  Integrating governing equations with respect to r and applying the above discussed boundary conditions will result in:       u  c   =     Δ  P   R  2     4   μ  p   L     [    1  -    (    R  -  δ   R   )   2   -     μ  p    μ  c      (   r  R   )   2     +     μ  p    μ  c      (    R  -  δ   R   )   2     ]         subscript  u  c         normal-Δ  P   superscript  R  2      4   subscript  μ  p   L     delimited-[]      1   superscript      R  δ   R   2        subscript  μ  p    subscript  μ  c     superscript    r  R   2          subscript  μ  p    subscript  μ  c     superscript      R  δ   R   2         u_{c}=\frac{\Delta PR^{2}}{4\mu_{p}L}[1-(\frac{R-\delta}{R})^{2}-\frac{\mu_{p}%

The expression for the total volumetric flow rate can be written as:      Q  =     π  Δ  P   R  4     8   μ  p   L     [   1  -     (   1  -   δ  R    )   4    (   1  -    μ  p    μ  c     )     ]        Q        π  normal-Δ  P   superscript  R  4      8   subscript  μ  p   L     delimited-[]    1     superscript    1    δ  R    4     1     subscript  μ  p    subscript  μ  c           Q=\frac{\pi\Delta PR^{4}}{8\mu_{p}L}[1-(1-\frac{\delta}{R})^{4}(1-\frac{\mu_{p%
 }}{\mu_{c}})]     Comparison with the viscosity which applies in the Poiseuille flow yields effective viscosity ,    μ  e     subscript  μ  e    \mu_{e}   as:       μ  e   =    μ  p    [   1  -     (   1  -   δ  R    )   4    (   1  -    μ  p    μ  c     )     ]         subscript  μ  e      subscript  μ  p    delimited-[]    1     superscript    1    δ  R    4     1     subscript  μ  p    subscript  μ  c           \mu_{e}=\frac{\mu_{p}}{[1-(1-\frac{\delta}{R})^{4}(1-\frac{\mu_{p}}{\mu_{c}})]}     It can be realized when the radius of the blood vessel is very larger than the thickness of the cell-free plasma layer, the effective viscosity is equal to bulk blood viscosity     μ  c     subscript  μ  c    \mu_{c}   at high shear rates (Newtonian fluid).
