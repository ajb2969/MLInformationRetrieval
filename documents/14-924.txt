Cell-free marginal layer model

In small capillary hemodynamics, the cell-free layer is a near-wall layer of plasma absent of red blood cells since they are subject to migration to the capillary center in Poiseuille flow.1Cell-free marginal layer model is a mathematical model which tries to explain Fåhræus–Lindqvist effect mathematically.
Mathematical modeling
Governing equations
Consider steady flow of blood through a capillary of radius

 
 . The capillary cross section can be divided into a core region and cell-free plasma region near the wall. The governing equations for both regions can be given by the following equations:2








where:


 
  is the pressure drop across the capillary


 
  is the length of capillary


 
  is velocity in core region


 
  is velocity of plasma in cell-free region


 
  is viscosity in core region


 
  is viscosity of plasma in cell-free region


 
  is the cell-free plasma layer thickness
Boundary conditions
The boundary conditions to obtain the solution for the two differential equations presented above are that the velocity gradient is zero in the tube center, no slip occurs at the tube wall and the velocity and the shear stress are continuous at the interface between the two zones. These boundary conditions can be expressed mathematically as:




















Velocity profiles
Integrating governing equations with respect to r and applying the above discussed boundary conditions will result in:






Volumetric flow rate
Total volumetric flow rate is the algebraic sum of the flow rates in core and plasma region. The expression for the total volumetric flow rate can be written as:



Comparison with the viscosity which applies in the Poiseuille flow yields effective viscosity, 
 
 
 
  as:



It can be realized when the radius of the blood vessel is very larger than the thickness of the cell-free plasma layer, the effective viscosity is equal to bulk blood viscosity

 
  at high shear rates (Newtonian fluid).
