Morton number


For Morton number in number theory, see Morton number (number theory).


In fluid dynamics, the Morton number (Mo) is a dimensionless number used together with the Eötvös number or Bond number to characterize the shape of bubbles or drops moving in a surrounding fluid or continuous phase, c. The Morton number is defined as



where g is the acceleration of gravity, 
 
 
 
  is the viscosity of the surrounding fluid, 
 
 
 
  the density of the surrounding fluid, 
 
 
 
  the difference in density of the phases, and 
 
 
 
  is the surface tension coefficient. For the case of a bubble with a negligible inner density the Morton number can be simplified to



The Morton number can also be expressed by using a combination of the Weber number, Froude number and Reynolds number,



The Froude number in the above expression is defined as



where V is a reference velocity and d is the equivalent diameter of the drop or bubble.
