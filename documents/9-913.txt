   Morton number      Morton number    For Morton number in number theory, see Morton number (number theory) .    In fluid dynamics , the Morton number ( Mo ) is a dimensionless number used together with the Eötvös number or Bond number to characterize the shape of bubbles or drops moving in a surrounding fluid or continuous phase, c . The Morton number is defined as       Mo  =    g    μ  c  4    Δ  ρ     ρ  c  2    σ  3      ,      Mo      g   superscript   subscript  μ  c   4   normal-Δ  ρ      superscript   subscript  ρ  c   2    superscript  σ  3       \mathrm{Mo}=\frac{g\mu_{c}^{4}\,\Delta\rho}{\rho_{c}^{2}\sigma^{3}},     where g is the acceleration of gravity,    μ  c     subscript  μ  c    \mu_{c}   is the viscosity of the surrounding fluid,    ρ  c     subscript  ρ  c    \rho_{c}   the density of the surrounding fluid,    Δ  ρ      normal-Δ  ρ    \Delta\rho   the difference in density of the phases, and   σ   σ   \sigma   is the surface tension coefficient. For the case of a bubble with a negligible inner density the Morton number can be simplified to       Mo  =    g   μ  c  4      ρ  c    σ  3      .      Mo      g   superscript   subscript  μ  c   4       subscript  ρ  c    superscript  σ  3       \mathrm{Mo}=\frac{g\mu_{c}^{4}}{\rho_{c}\sigma^{3}}.     The Morton number can also be expressed by using a combination of the Weber number , Froude number and Reynolds number ,       Mo  =    We  3     Fr    Re  4      .      Mo     superscript  We  3     Fr   superscript  Re  4       \mathrm{Mo}=\frac{\mathrm{We}^{3}}{\mathrm{Fr}\,\mathrm{Re}^{4}}.     The Froude number in the above expression is defined as      Fr  =    V  2    g  d        Fr     superscript  V  2     g  d      \mathrm{Fr}=\frac{V^{2}}{gd}     where V is a reference velocity and d is the equivalent diameter of the drop or bubble.
