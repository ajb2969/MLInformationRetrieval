   Law (stochastic processes)      Law (stochastic processes)   In mathematics , the law of a stochastic process is the measure that the process induces on the collection of functions from the index set into the state space. The law encodes a lot of information about the process; in the case of a random walk , for example, the law is the probability distribution of the possible trajectories of the walk.  Definition  Let (Ω, F , P ) be a probability space , T some index set, and ( S , Σ) a measurable space . Let X : T × Ω → S be a stochastic process (so the map  $$X_{t} : \Omega \to S : \omega \mapsto X (t, \omega)$$  is a ( F , Σ)- measurable function for each t ∈ T ). Let S T denote the collection of all functions from T into S . The process X (by way of currying ) induces a function Φ X : Ω → S T , where  $$\left( \Phi_{X} (\omega) \right) (t) := X_{t} (\omega).$$  The law of the process X is then defined to be the pushforward measure  $$\mathcal{L}_{X} := \left( \Phi_{X} \right)_{*} ( \mathbf{P} ) = \mathbf P \circ \Phi_X^{-1}$$  on S T .  Example   The law of standard Brownian motion is classical Wiener measure . (Indeed, many authors define Brownian motion to be a sample continuous process starting at the origin whose law is Wiener measure, and then proceed to derive the independence of increments and other properties from this definition; other authors prefer to work in the opposite direction.)
