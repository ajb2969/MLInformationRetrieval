Tricin synthase

Tricin synthase (, ROMT-17, ROMT-15, HvOMT1, ZmOMT1) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tricetin 3',5'-O-dimethyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + tricetin

 
  2 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3',5'-O-dimethyltricetin (overall reaction)
 
(1a) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + tricetin 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3'-O-methyltricetin

(1b) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 3'-O-methyltricetin 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3',5'-O-dimethyltricetin
 

The enzymes from Oryza sativa (ROMT-15 and ROMT-17) catalyses the stepwise methylation of tricetin to its 3'-mono- and 3',5'-dimethyl ethers.
