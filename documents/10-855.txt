   TRNA (guanine-N2-)-methyltransferase      TRNA (guanine-N2-)-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a tRNA (guanine-N2-)-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + tRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + tRNA containing N 2 -methylguanine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and tRNA , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and tRNA containing N2-Methylguanine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (guanine-N2-)-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include transfer ribonucleate guanine 2-methyltransferase , transfer ribonucleate guanine N2-methyltransferase , transfer RNA guanine 2-methyltransferase , guanine-N2-methylase , and S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (guanine-2-N-)-methyltransferase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
