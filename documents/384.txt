   Stoletov curve      Stoletov curve   [[Image:Stoletov_curve.JPG|thumb|right|300px|   Stoletov curve   ]] Stoletov curve shows the dependence of the magnetic permeability    χ   χ   \chi   of ferromagnetics on the intensity of the applied magnetic field  H . The curve is named after physicist  Aleksandr Stoletov who analyzed in a long series of experiments the magnetic properties of iron rings in the period 1871–1872 during his stay at the Physical Laboratory of the University of Heidelberg . 1 2  Notes  "  Category:Magnetism     ↩  ↩
