   (R)-2-hydroxy-fatty-acid dehydrogenase      (R)-2-hydroxy-fatty-acid dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a (R)-2-hydroxy-fatty-acid dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (R)-2-hydroxystearate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-oxostearate + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (R)-2-hydroxystearate and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 2-oxostearate , NADH , and H + . This reaction is important in fatty acid metabolism .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-2-hydroxystearate:NAD + oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include D-2-hydroxy fatty acid dehydrogenase , and 2-hydroxy fatty acid oxidase .
