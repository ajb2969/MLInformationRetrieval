   Crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase      Crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase   Crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase (, CCR , crotonyl-CoA reductase (carboxylating) ) is an enzyme with system name (2S)-ethylmalonyl-CoA:NADP + oxidoreductase (decarboxylating) . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (2S)-ethylmalonyl-CoA + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (E)-but-2-enoyl-CoA + CO 2 + NADPH + H +    The reaction is catalysed in the reverse direction.
