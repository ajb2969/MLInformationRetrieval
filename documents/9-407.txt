   Leverett J-function      Leverett J-function   In petroleum engineering , the Leverett J -function is a dimensionless function of water saturation describing the capillary pressure , 1       J   (   S  w   )    =     p  c    (   S  w   )     k  /  ϕ      γ   cos  θ           J   subscript  S  w         subscript  p  c    subscript  S  w       k  ϕ       γ    θ       J(S_{w})=\frac{p_{c}(S_{w})\sqrt{k/\phi}}{\gamma\cos\theta}   where    S  w     subscript  S  w    S_{w}   is the water saturation measured as a fraction,    p  c     subscript  p  c    p_{c}   is the capillary pressure (in pascal ),   k   k   k   is the permeability (measured in m² ),   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is the porosity (0-1),   γ   γ   \gamma   is the surface tension (in N/m) and   θ   θ   \theta   is the contact angle . The function is important in that it is constant for a given saturation within a reservoir, thus relating reservoir properties for neighboring beds.  The Leverett J -function is an attempt at extrapolating capillary pressure data for a given rock to rocks that are similar but with differing permeability, porosity and wetting properties. It assumes that the porous rock can be modelled as a bundle of non-connecting capillary tubes, where the factor     k  /  ϕ         k  ϕ     \sqrt{k/\phi}   is a characteristic length of the capillaries' radii.
