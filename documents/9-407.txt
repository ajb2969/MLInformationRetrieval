Leverett J-function

In petroleum engineering, the Leverett J-function is a dimensionless function of water saturation describing the capillary pressure,1


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the water saturation measured as a fraction, 
 
 
 
  is the capillary pressure (in pascal), 
 
 
 
  is the permeability (measured in mÂ²), 
 
 
 
  is the porosity (0-1), 
 
 
 
  is the surface tension (in N/m) and 
 
 
 
  is the contact angle. The function is important in that it is constant for a given saturation within a reservoir, thus relating reservoir properties for neighboring beds.
The Leverett J-function is an attempt at extrapolating capillary pressure data for a given rock to rocks that are similar but with differing permeability, porosity and wetting properties. It assumes that the porous rock can be modelled as a bundle of non-connecting capillary tubes, where the factor 
 
 
 
  is a characteristic length of the capillaries' radii.
