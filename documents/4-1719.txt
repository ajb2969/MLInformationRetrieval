}} In probability theory, the Type-2 Gumbel probability density function is



for


 
 .
This implies that it is similar to the Weibull distributions, substituting 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Note however that a positive k (as in the Weibull distribution) would yield a negative a, which is not allowed here as it would yield a negative probability density.
For 
 
 

The moments 
 
 
 
  exist for $k < a\,$
The special case b = 1 yields the Fréchet distribution
