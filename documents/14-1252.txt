Inertial number

The Inertial number

 
  quantifies the significance of dynamic effects in a granular material. It measures the ratio of inertial forces of grains to imposed forces: a small value corresponds to the quasi-static state, while a high value corresponds to the inertial state or even the "dynamic" state.1234





where 
 
 
 
  is the shear rate, 
 
 
 
  the average particle diameter, 
 
 
 
  is the pressure and 
 
 
 
  is the density.
Generally three regimes are distinguished:



 
 : quasi static flow



 
 : collisional flow
