   Inertial number      Inertial number   The Inertial number    I   I   I   quantifies the significance of dynamic effects in a granular material . It measures the ratio of inertial forces of grains to imposed forces: a small value corresponds to the quasi-static state, while a high value corresponds to the inertial state or even the "dynamic" state. 1 2 3 4        I  =     γ  ˙   d     P  /  ρ      ,      I       normal-˙  γ   d       P  ρ       I=\frac{\dot{\gamma}d}{\sqrt{P/\rho}},      where    γ  ˙     normal-˙  γ    \dot{\gamma}   is the shear rate ,   d   d   d   the average particle diameter,   P   P   P   is the pressure and   ρ   ρ   \rho   is the density.  Generally three regimes are distinguished:       I  <   10   -  3        I   superscript  10    3      I<10^{-3}   : quasi static flow  10^{-3} : dense flow      I  >   10   -  1        I   superscript  10    1      I>10^{-1}   : collisional flow   References  "  Category:Granularity of materials     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
