In mathematics, a Preradical is a subfunctor of the identity functor in the category of left modules over a ring with identity. The class of all preradicals over R-mod is denoted by R-pr. Theres is a natural order in R-pr given by, for any two preradicals 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , if for any left R-module M, 
 
 
 
 . With this order R-pr becomes a big lattice.
