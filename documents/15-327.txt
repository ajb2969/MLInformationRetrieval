   Template:Preradicals      Template:Preradicals   In mathematics , a Preradical is a subfunctor of the identity functor in the category of left modules over a ring with identity. The class of all preradicals over R-mod is denoted by R-pr. Theres is a natural order in R-pr given by, for any two preradicals   σ   σ   \sigma   and   τ   τ   \tau   ,    σ  ≤  τ      σ  τ    \sigma\leq\tau   , if for any left R-module M,     σ  M   ≤   τ  M         σ  M     τ  M     \sigma M\leq\tau M   . With this order R-pr becomes a big lattice.  References   Stenstrom, Bo Rings of Quotients: An Introduction To Methods Of Ring Theory - Chapter 6 , Springer, ISBN 0387071172"
