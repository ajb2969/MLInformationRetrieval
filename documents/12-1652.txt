   Papyrus 122      Papyrus 122   Papyrus 122 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), designated by   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    122 , is an early copy of the New Testament in Greek . It is a papyrus  manuscript of the Gospel of John .  Description  To the present day survived only two pieces from one leaf. The surviving texts of John are verses 21:11-14,22-24, they are in a fragmentary condition. The manuscript paleographically had been assigned to the 4th or 5th century ( INTF ). 1 It was written by irregular hand.  It uses nomina sacra . Name Ιησους (Jesus) is abbreviated to ΙΗΣ (majority of manuscripts used abbreviation ΙΣ ). Number "one hundred and fifty-three" is written in abbreviation — ΡΝΓ .  The Greek text of this codex probably is a representative of the Alexandrian text-type .  Text  In John 21:14 omitted word Ιησους (Jesus), just like in Codex Washingtonianus , 2 rest of the manuscripts contain this word, usually with an article (ο Ιησους). 3         𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    122    Translation      Ανεβη ουν Σιμων  Πε τρος και ειλ   So Simon Peter went aboard and     κυσεν το δικτυον ε ις τ ην γην μεσ   hauled the net ashore, full     τον ιχθυων μεγαλω ν ΡΝΓ κ αι το   of large fish, a 153 of them; and     σουτων οντων ουκ ε σχισθη τ ο δικ   although there were so many, the net was not     τυον λεγει αυτοις ο Ι  ΗΣ δευτε  αριστη   torn. Jesus said to them, “Come and have     σατε ουδεις δε ετολμ α των μ αθητων ε   breakfast.” Now none of the disciples dared     ξετασαι αυτων Συ τις  ει ειδοτε ς οτι   ask him, “Who are you?” They knew     ο ΚΣ εστιν ερχετ αι ΙΗΣ και  λαμ   it was the Lord. Jesus came and took     βανει τον αρτον κα ι διδωσιν  αυτοις   the bread and gave it to them,     και το οψαριον ομοι ως τουτο  ηδη   and so with the fish. This was now     τριτον εφανερωθη  τοις μ αθηταις   the third time that He was revealed to the disciples     εγερθεις εκ νεκρων   after He was raised from the dead.       In red colour missing letters.  Location  The manuscript currently is housed at the Papyrology Rooms of the Sackler Library at Oxford with the shelf number P. Oxy. 4806.
