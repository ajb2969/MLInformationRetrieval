Papyrus 122

Papyrus 122 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), designated by 
 
 
122, is an early copy of the New Testament in Greek. It is a papyrus manuscript of the Gospel of John.
Description
To the present day survived only two pieces from one leaf. The surviving texts of John are verses 21:11-14,22-24, they are in a fragmentary condition. The manuscript paleographically had been assigned to the 4th or 5th century (INTF).1 It was written by irregular hand.
It uses nomina sacra. Name Ιησους (Jesus) is abbreviated to ΙΗΣ (majority of manuscripts used abbreviation ΙΣ). Number "one hundred and fifty-three" is written in abbreviation — ΡΝΓ.
The Greek text of this codex probably is a representative of the Alexandrian text-type.
Text
In John 21:14 omitted word Ιησους (Jesus), just like in Codex Washingtonianus,2 rest of the manuscripts contain this word, usually with an article (ο Ιησους).3

Translation




Ανεβη ουν Σιμων Πετρος και ειλ

So Simon Peter went aboard and



κυσεν το δικτυον εις την γην μεσ

hauled the net ashore, full



τον ιχθυων μεγαλων ΡΝΓ και το

of large fish, a 153 of them; and



σουτων οντων ουκ εσχισθη το δικ

although there were so many, the net was not



τυον λεγει αυτοις ο Ι
ΗΣ δευτε αριστη

torn. Jesus said to them, “Come and have



σατε ουδεις δε ετολμα των μαθητων ε

breakfast.” Now none of the disciples dared



ξετασαι αυτων Συ τις ει ειδοτες οτι

ask him, “Who are you?” They knew



ο ΚΣ εστιν ερχεται ΙΗΣ και λαμ

it was the Lord. Jesus came and took



βανει τον αρτον και διδωσιν αυτοις

the bread and gave it to them,



και το οψαριον ομοιως τουτο ηδη

and so with the fish. This was now



τριτον εφανερωθη τοις μαθηταις

the third time that He was revealed to the disciples



εγερθεις εκ νεκρων

after He was raised from the dead.





In red colour missing letters.
