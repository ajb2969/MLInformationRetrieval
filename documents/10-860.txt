Tyramine N-methyltransferase




Tyramine N-methyltransferase

In enzymology, a tyramine N-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + tyramine 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N-methyltyramine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and tyramine, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and N-methyltyramine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tyramine N-methyltransferase. Other names in common use include DIB O-methyltransferase (3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxy-benzoic acid), S-adenosyl-methionine:tyramine N-methyltransferase, and tyramine methylpherase. This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism.
