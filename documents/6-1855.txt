   Complete intersection      Complete intersection   In mathematics, an algebraic variety  V in projective space is a complete intersection if the ideal of V is generated by exactly codim V elements. That is, if V has dimension  m and lies in projective space P n , there should exist n − m homogeneous polynomials   F i ( X 0 , ..., X n ), 1 ≤ i ≤ n − m ,   in the homogeneous coordinates  X j , generate all other homogeneous polynomial which vanishes on V.  Geometrically, each F i defines a hypersurface ; the intersection of these hypersurfaces should be V . The intersection of n - m hypersurfaces will always have dimension at least m , assuming that the field of scalars is an algebraically closed field such as the complex numbers . The question is essentially, can we get the dimension down to m , with no extra points in the intersection? This condition is fairly hard to check as soon as the codimension n − m ≥ 2. When n − m = 1 then V is automatically a hypersurface and there is nothing to prove.  Example of a space curve that is not a complete intersection  A classic example is the twisted cubic in    ℙ  3     superscript  ℙ  3    \mathbb{P}^{3}   : it is a set-theoretic complete intersection, i.e. as a set it can be expressed as the intersection of 2 hypersurfaces, but not an ideal-theoretic (or scheme-theoretic) complete intersection, i.e. its homogeneous ideal cannot be generated by 2 elements.  Its degree is 3, so to be an ideal-theoretic complete intersection it would have to be the intersection of two surfaces of degrees 1 and 3, by the hypersurface Bézout theorem . In other words, it would have to be the intersection of a plane and a cubic surface . But by direct calculation, any four distinct points on the curve are not coplanar, so it cannot lie in a plane, ruling out the only possible case. The twisted cubic lies on many quadrics , but the intersection of any two of these quadrics will always contain the curve plus an extra line, since the intersection of two quadrics has degree      2  ×  2   =  4   ,        2  2   4    2\times 2=4,   and the twisted cubic has degree 3, so the only way to get degree 4 is to add a line.  On the other hand, the twisted cubic, as a set, is the intersection of the quadric surface      x  z   -   y  2    =  0          x  z    superscript  y  2    0    xz-y^{2}=0   and the cubic surface      z   (    y  w   -   z  2    )    -   w   (    x  w   -   y  z    )     =  0          z      y  w    superscript  z  2       w      x  w     y  z      0    z(yw-z^{2})-w(xw-yz)=0   in    ℙ  3     superscript  ℙ  3    \mathbb{P}^{3}   . Formally the degree of that intersection is 6, so in a more refined sense, the intersection is actually the twisted cubic counted with multiplicity two.  Multidegree  A complete intersection has a multidegree , written as the tuple (properly though a multiset ) of the degrees of defining hypersurfaces. For example taking quadrics in P 3 again, (2,2) is the multidegree of the complete intersection of two of them, which when they are in general position is an elliptic curve . The Hodge numbers of complex smooth complete intersections were worked out by Kunihiko Kodaira .  General position  For more refined questions, the nature of the intersection has to be addressed more closely. The hypersurfaces may be required to satisfy a transversality condition (like their tangent spaces being in general position at intersection points). The intersection may be scheme-theoretic , in other words here the homogeneous ideal generated by the F i ( X 0 , ..., X n ) may be required to be the defining ideal of V , and not just have the correct radical . In commutative algebra , the complete intersection condition is translated into regular sequence terms, allowing the definition of local complete intersection , or after some localization an ideal has defining regular sequences.
