4-phosphoerythronate dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a 4-phosphoerythronate dehydogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4-phospho-D-erythronate + NAD+

 
  (3R)-3-hydroxy-2-oxo-4-phosphonooxybutanoate + NADH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-phospho-D-erythronate and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are (3R)-3-hydroxy-2-oxo-4-phosphonooxybutanoate, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-phospho-D-erythronate:NAD+ 2-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include PdxB, PdxB 4PE dehydrogenase, and 4-O-phosphoerythronate dehydrogenase. This enzyme participates in vitamin B6 metabolism.
Structural studies
