   Draft:Mutual energy theorem      Draft:Mutual energy theorem    Mutual Energy Theorem  The concept of mutual energy is defined as the difference between the total energy and self energy. In electromagnetic field the total energy and the self energy satisfies the Poynting energy theorem, that means the total energy and self energy are conservative.  According the definition of the mutual energy, it is clear the mutual energy should be also conservative, hence there is  This is referred as mutual energy theorem. where ∇• S is the divergence of the Poynting vector (energy flow) and J • E is the rate at which the fields do work on a charged object ( J is the free  current density corresponding to the motion of charge, E is the electric field , and • is the dot product ). The energy density  u is given by:       u  12   =    1  2    (     𝐄  𝟏   ⋅   𝐃  𝟐    +    𝐇  𝟏   ⋅   𝐁  𝟐     )         subscript  u  12       1  2      normal-⋅   subscript  𝐄  1    subscript  𝐃  2     normal-⋅   subscript  𝐇  1    subscript  𝐁  2        u_{12}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf{E_{1}}\cdot\mathbf{D_{2}}+\mathbf{H_{1}}\cdot%

Since the charges are free to move, and the D and H fields bypass any bound charges and currents in the charge distribution (by their definition), J is the current density .  Using the divergence theorem , the mutual energy theorem can be rewritten in integral form :  where    ∂   V       V    \partial V\!   is the boundary of a volume V . The shape of the volume is arbitrary but fixed for the calculation.  It is looks this theorem is trivial, however it can be the basis of a group of mutual energy theorems and reciprocity theorems. It is a bridge between Poynting energy theorem and reciprocity theorems.

Carson has called the reciprocity theorem as ``Reciprocal energy theorem'' in the reference 2 . But until now the two theorems are two different theorems derived from Maxwell equations respectively.  Many efforts try to reveal the relationship between the reciprocity theorem and Poynting theorem have been done. V. H. Rumsey proposed the concept of the reaction Rumsey, V. H., Reaction concept in electromagnetic theory, Phys. Rev., vol 94 Jun 1954, pp 1483-1491.  in 1954 which is related to Lorentz reciprocity theorem. But what is the concept of the ``reaction'' behind scene? He did not tell us more deeply.  W.J. Welch has derived a reciprocity theorem Welch, W. J., Reciprocity theorems for electromagnetic fields whose time dependence is arbitrary, IRE trans. On Antennas and Propagation, vol AP-8, Jan 1960, PP68-73.  in 1960, which is in the following      -    ∫  S     ∫   t  =   -  ∞    ∞     (       E  1    (  t  )    ×   H  2     (  t  )    +      E  2    (  t  )    ×   H  1     (  t  )     )   d   t    n  ^   d  S           subscript   S     superscript   subscript     t                     subscript  E  1   t    subscript  H  2    t          subscript  E  2   t    subscript  H  1    t    d  t   normal-^  n   d  S       -\int_{S}\int_{t=-\infty}^{\infty}(E_{1}(t)\times H_{2}(t)+E_{2}(t)\times H_{1%

Welch did not mention what will be if the two fields are same, for example, both are retarded potential.  Welch has derived another reciprocity theorem in 1961,       ∫  S     ∫   t  =   -  ∞    ∞     (       E  1    (  t  )    ×   H  2     (  t  )    -      E  2    (  t  )    ×   H  1     (  t  )     )   d   t    n  ^   d  S        subscript   S     superscript   subscript     t                     subscript  E  1   t    subscript  H  2    t          subscript  E  2   t    subscript  H  1    t    d  t   normal-^  n   d  S      \int_{S}\int_{t=-\infty}^{\infty}(E_{1}(t)\times H_{2}(t)-E_{2}(t)\times H_{1}%

Welch's reciprocity theorem is a special situation of the time-correlation reciprocity theorem where the time variable    τ  =  0      τ  0    \textstyle\tau=0   . By the way in the theorem of de Hoop 18 the surface integral appeared but has been thought that it will vanish on the infinite sphere. Baun has a book Book of ``Electromagnetic Symmetry'' edited by Carl E. Baum, Haralambos N. Kritikos, 1995  in 1995 which systematically introduced reciprocity theorems. The reference D.

However they only discussed them together and did not offer the direct relationship between the two theorems. The reference 19 discussed the reciprocity theorem in bi-anisotropic media.  There is a concept ``mixed Poynting vector'' Fragstein, Conrad von, The History of the Mixed Poynting Vector, Veröffentlicht in: Abhandlungen der Braunschweigischen Wissenschaftlichen Gesellschaft Band 39, 1987, S.25-29  Angus Macleod, The Mixed Poynting Vector, http://www.svc.org/DigitalLibrary/documents/2014_Summer_AMacleod.pdf  which is close related to the concept mutual energy and Poynting vector. Chen-To Tai has derived the complementary reciprocity theorem Chen-To Tai, Life Fellow, IEEE, Complementary Reciprocity Theorems in Electromagnetic Theory, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION, VOL. 40, NO. 6, JUNE 1992 675   It is worth to notice that in the reference 20 21 22 , the concept of ``mutual energy'' was not well defined and the related concept ``total energy'' and ``self energy'' were also not defined. The so called mutual energy theorem is only derived from the modified reciprocity theorem instead of Poynting theorem, hence such name: mutual energy theorem is still not widely acceptable.  Mutual energy theorems  The goal of the article 23 is to convince the reader that the mutual energy theorem is a real energy theorem. The reciprocity theorem is special situation of the mutual energy theorem where two electromagnetic fields one is retarded potential, the other is advanced potential. To achieve this goal the mutual energy theorem have to be derived from Poynting theorem instead of from Maxwell equation directly. In this article a few new concept is defined or generalized. Among them there is ``modified , ``time-reversed transform , ``mutual energy , ``self energy , ``total energy . The concept of ``reaction is re-explained. The mutual energy theorem is re-derived from Poynting theorem. The derivation include different versions and the history is introduced. A few new theorems are obtained from the derivation, the following gives the details.  The modified Maxwell equations  The concept of ``modified'' is borrowed from the modified reciprocity theorem, where two electromagnetic fields are put in different media with different   ϵ   ϵ   \textstyle\epsilon   and   μ   μ   \textstyle\mu   and can be superimposed. We found for this situation the Maxwell equations are still established. In this kind of media, the Maxwell equations are referred as modified Maxwell equations.  The modified and generalized Poynting theorem  The Poynting theorem is extented to the modified Poynting theorem. The concept of ``modified'' is borrowed from the modified reciprocity theorem 24 as the above of the modified Maxwell equations. This idea has also been used in the mutual energy theorem which is modified mutual energy 25 26 27 . The Poynting theorem is further extended to generalized Poynting theorem in which transformed electromagnetic field can be superposed. The transform can be time-reversed transform, magnetic/electric mirrored transform, electric-magnetic swapping transform.  Time-reversed transform  We knew that after a magnetic mirror transform the electromagnetic field    (  E  ,  H  )     E  H    \textstyle(E,H)   is still electromagnetic field. A electromagnetic field after a time-reversed transform is not a electromagnetic field any more. That means after the time-reversed transform it does not satisfy the Maxwell equation. However we modified the time-reversed transform through introducing the negative media with negative   ϵ   ϵ   \textstyle\epsilon   ,   μ   μ   \textstyle\mu   , this new time-reversed transform is given in the following,       [    E  r    (  t  )    ,    H  r    (  t  )    ,    J  r    (  t  )    ,    K  r    (  t  )    ,    ϵ  r    (  t  )    ,    μ  r    (  t  )    ]   ≡   r   [   E   (  t  )    ,   H   (  t  )    ,   J   (  t  )    ,   K   (  t  )    ,   ϵ   (  t  )    ,   μ   (  t  )    ]            subscript  E  r   t      subscript  H  r   t      subscript  J  r   t      subscript  K  r   t      subscript  ϵ  r   t      subscript  μ  r   t      r     E  t     H  t     J  t     K  t     ϵ  t     μ  t       [E_{r}(t),H_{r}(t),J_{r}(t),K_{r}(t),\epsilon_{r}(t),\mu_{r}(t)]\equiv r[E(t),%
 H(t),J(t),K(t),\epsilon(t),\mu(t)]          =   [   E   (   -  t   )    ,   H   (   -  t   )    ,   J   (   -  t   )    ,   K   (   -  t   )    ,   -   ϵ   (   -  t   )     ,   -   μ   (   -  t   )     ]       absent     E    t      H    t      J    t      K    t        ϵ    t         μ    t        =[E(-t),H(-t),J(-t),K(-t),-\epsilon(-t),-\mu(-t)]     A electromagnetic fields after the above updated time-reverse transform is still electromagnetic fields satisfies Maxwell equations. This time reverse transform is one of the import tool to derive the mutual energy theorem from Poynting theorem in Fourier domain.  The difference the substitution and the replace of a transform is noticed  There are many transforms: magnetic mirror transform, electric mirror transform, time-reversed transform. Time-offset transform. There are two process for the above transform, one is substitution of the transform, the other is replace of a transform. Replace and substitution are two different process, in the history many mistakes were made because the confusion of this two processes. In this article we try to clarify the difference of the replacement and substitution of a transform.  Introduced the instantaneous mutual energy theorem  In this article the concept of mutual energy is defined as the difference between the total energy and the self energy. The instantaneous mutual energy theorem is derived from Poynting theorem with the concept of mutual energy. The instantaneous mutual energy theorem is following,      -   ∇  ⋅   (     E  1   ×   H  2    +    E  2   ×   H  1     )         normal-⋅  normal-∇       subscript  E  1    subscript  H  2       subscript  E  2    subscript  H  1        -\nabla\cdot(E_{1}\times H_{2}+E_{2}\times H_{1})          =     J  1   ⋅   E  2    +    J  2   ⋅   E  1    +    K  1   ⋅   H  2    +    K  2   ⋅   H  1    +    E  1   ⋅   ∂   D  2     +    E  2   ⋅   ∂   D  1     +    H  1   ⋅   ∂   B  2     +    H  2   ⋅   ∂   B  1          absent     normal-⋅   subscript  J  1    subscript  E  2     normal-⋅   subscript  J  2    subscript  E  1     normal-⋅   subscript  K  1    subscript  H  2     normal-⋅   subscript  K  2    subscript  H  1     normal-⋅   subscript  E  1      subscript  D  2      normal-⋅   subscript  E  2      subscript  D  1      normal-⋅   subscript  H  1      subscript  B  2      normal-⋅   subscript  H  2      subscript  B  1        =J_{1}\cdot E_{2}+J_{2}\cdot E_{1}+K_{1}\cdot H_{2}+K_{2}\cdot H_{1}+E_{1}%

 \cdot H_{2}(t)-J_{2}(t)\cdot E_{1}(t+\tau)+K_{2}(t)\cdot H_{1}(t+\tau))\,dt\,dV     Re-derived the Lorenz reciprocity theorem from the mutual energy theorem  The Lorenz reciprocity theorem 29 30 is shown as a special situation of the mutual energy theorem. In the special situation where two electromagnetic fields are different, one is the field of retarded potential and the other is the field of advanced potential. The concept of the reaction 31 is re-explained as the mutual energy (or power) of the two electromagnetic fields where one is the field of retarded potential and the other is the field of advanced potential.  Re-derived time-correlation mutual energy theorem from Poynting theorem  In the above we have derived the mutual energy theorem in Fourier domain. The derivation is that first derive the time-reversed mutual energy theorem and then through a time-reverse transform we obtained the mutual energy theorem. We did not very satisfy with this process of derivation. Since it is not a pure derivation from Poynting theorem. The time-reversed transform need the Maxwell equation to prove. Hence we actually derived the mutual energy theorem form Poynting theorem plus Maxwell equation. A purely derivation from Poynting theorem should not use the transform for example the mirrored transform or time-reversed transform. Hence we seek another way to prove the mutual energy theorem and avoid the time-reversed transform. We have proved that the time-correlation mutual energy theorem from Poynting theorem. And then considered a Fourier transform for the time-correlation mutual energy theorem, we obtained the mutual energy theorem. This way we have purely derived the mutual energy theorem form the Poynting theorem.  Introduced the mixed mutual energy theorem  We have try to derive the mutual energy theorem from complex Poynting theorem. But we failed to do so. Instead to obtained the mutual energy theorem we obtained the following mixed mutual energy theorem.      -    ∫  S      (     E  1   ×   H  2  *    +    E  2   ×   H  1  *     )   ⋅   n  ^    d  S          subscript   S      normal-⋅       subscript  E  1    superscript   subscript  H  2         subscript  E  2    superscript   subscript  H  1        normal-^  n    d  S      -\int_{S}(E_{1}\times H_{2}^{*}+E_{2}\times H_{1}^{*})\cdot\hat{n}dS          =    ∫  V     (     E  1   ⋅   J  2  *    +    E  2   ⋅   J  1  *    +    H  1  *   ⋅   K  2    +    H  2  *   ⋅   K  1     )   d  V        absent    subscript   V        normal-⋅   subscript  E  1    superscript   subscript  J  2       normal-⋅   subscript  E  2    superscript   subscript  J  1       normal-⋅   superscript   subscript  H  1      subscript  K  2     normal-⋅   superscript   subscript  H  2      subscript  K  1     d  V      =\int_{V}(E_{1}\cdot J_{2}^{*}+E_{2}\cdot J_{1}^{*}+H_{1}^{*}\cdot K_{2}+H_{2}%

 _{1}^{*}*E_{1}^{*})(t))\,dt\,dV     The mixed mutual energy theorem is related with the concept of mixed Poynting vector 32 33 . We do not clear perhaps the mixed mutual energy has some usage in the future.  Introduced the inner product to the mutual energy theorem  This author has introduced the inner product in Fourier domain 34 35 36 . In this article this idea is generalized to time domain. In time domain the inner product is defined as following        (   ζ  1   ,   ζ  2   )   τ   =    ∫  S     ∫   t  =   -  ∞    ∞     (       E  1    (   t  +  τ   )    ×   H  2     (  t  )    +      E  2    (  t  )    ×   H  1     (   t  +  τ   )     )   d   t    n  ^   d  S          subscript    subscript  ζ  1    subscript  ζ  2    τ     subscript   S     superscript   subscript     t                     subscript  E  1     t  τ     subscript  H  2    t          subscript  E  2   t    subscript  H  1      t  τ     d  t   normal-^  n   d  S       (\zeta_{1},\zeta_{2})_{\tau}=\int_{S}\int_{t=-\infty}^{\infty}(E_{1}(t+\tau)%
 \times H_{2}(t)+E_{2}(t)\times H_{1}(t+\tau))\,dt\,\hat{n}dS     The author has shown that     (   ζ  1   ,   ζ  2   )   τ     subscript    subscript  ζ  1    subscript  ζ  2    τ    \textstyle(\zeta_{1},\zeta_{2})_{\tau}   is not a good inner product, but     (   ζ  1   ,   ζ  2   )    τ  =  0      subscript    subscript  ζ  1    subscript  ζ  2      τ  0     \textstyle(\zeta_{1},\zeta_{2})_{\tau=0}   is a good inner product. The inner product can be applied to the wave expansion problem. The normal function expansion methods can be applied to electromagnetic field wave expansions.  Re-explained the concept of the reaction  Many confused concept about transform is clarified. There are time-reversed transform, mirror transform, time offset transform. In the above transform there are two different process in derivation of new theory one is substitution and the other is replacement. Mistake is often caused by confusing the replacement as substitution. The concept of causal field, advanced potential, retard potential, offset field, transmitting filed, receiving field is clarified too. The concept reaction is re-explained as the mutual energy of two fields one is retarded potential and the other one is advanced potential.  Complementary theorems  Chen-To Tai has derived the complementary reciprocity theorem 37 . We have obtained 4 theorems, 2 mutual energy theorems and 2 reciprocity theorems. We apply the electromagnetic field swapping transform       ζ  s   =   s  ζ   =   [   Z  H   ,    1  Z   E   ,   -    1  Z   K    ,   -   Z  J    ,   -    1   Z  2    μ    ,   -    Z  2   ϵ    ]          subscript  ζ  s     s  ζ           Z  H       1  Z   E         1  Z   K        Z  J          1   superscript  Z  2    μ         superscript  Z  2   ϵ        \zeta_{s}=s\zeta=[ZH,\frac{1}{Z}E,-\frac{1}{Z}K,-ZJ,-\frac{1}{Z^{2}}\mu,-Z^{2}\epsilon]     to the 4 theorems, 4 corresponding complementary theorems are obtained. Among them one is the Chen-To tai's complementary reciprocity theorem.
