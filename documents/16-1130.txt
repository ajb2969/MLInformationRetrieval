Two-Higgs-doublet model

In particle physics, a two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) is an extension of the Standard Model in which a second Higgs doublet is added.1
The addition of the second Higgs doublet leads to five physical states: the CP even neutral Higgs bosons 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  (where 
 
 
 
  is heavier than 
 
 
 
 
  by convention), the CP odd pseudoscalar

 
  and two charged Higgs bosons 
 
 
 
 . Such a model has six free parameters: four Higgs masses (
 
 
 
 ), the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values (
 
 
 
 ) and a mixing angle (
 
 
 
 
 ).
A special case is when 
 
 
 
 , the so-called alignment limit, in which the lighter CP even Higgs boson 
 
 
 
  has couplings like the Higgs boson of the Standard Model.2
Classification
Two-Higgs-doublet models can introduce Flavor-changing neutral currents which have not been observed so far. The Glashow-Weinberg condition, requiring that each group of fermions (up-type quarks, down-type quarks and charged leptons) couples exactly to one of the two doublets, is sufficient to avoid the prediction of flavor-changing neutral currents.
Depending on which type of fermions couples to which doublet 
 
 
 
 , one can divide two-Higgs-doublet models into the following classes:34
