   Two-Higgs-doublet model      Two-Higgs-doublet model   In particle physics , a two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) is an extension of the Standard Model in which a second Higgs doublet is added. 1  The addition of the second Higgs doublet leads to five physical states: the CP even neutral Higgs bosons   h   h   h   and   H   H   H   (where   H   H   H   is heavier than   h   h   h   by convention), the CP odd pseudoscalar    A   A   A   and two charged Higgs bosons    H  ±     superscript  H  plus-or-minus    H^{\pm}   . Such a model has six free parameters: four Higgs masses (     m  h   ,   m  H   ,   m  A   ,   m   H  ±        subscript  m  h    subscript  m  H    subscript  m  A    subscript  m   superscript  H  plus-or-minus      m_{h},m_{H},m_{A},m_{H^{\pm}}   ), the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values (    tan  β      β    \tan\beta   ) and a mixing angle (   α   α   \alpha   ).  A special case is when     cos   (   β  -  α   )    =  0          β  α    0    \cos(\beta-\alpha)=0   , the so-called alignment limit , in which the lighter CP even Higgs boson   h   h   h   has couplings like the Higgs boson of the Standard Model. 2  Classification  Two-Higgs-doublet models can introduce Flavor-changing neutral currents which have not been observed so far. The Glashow-Weinberg condition, requiring that each group of fermions (up-type quarks, down-type quarks and charged leptons) couples exactly to one of the two doublets, is sufficient to avoid the prediction of flavor-changing neutral currents.  Depending on which type of fermions couples to which doublet   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   , one can divide two-Higgs-doublet models into the following classes: 3 4      Type   Description   up-type quarks couple to   down-type quarks couple to   charged leptons couple to   remarks       Type I   Fermiophobic       Φ  2     subscript  normal-Φ  2    \Phi_{2}          Φ  2     subscript  normal-Φ  2    \Phi_{2}          Φ  2     subscript  normal-Φ  2    \Phi_{2}      charged fermions only couple to second doublet     Type II   MSSM -like       Φ  2     subscript  normal-Φ  2    \Phi_{2}          Φ  1     subscript  normal-Φ  1    \Phi_{1}          Φ  1     subscript  normal-Φ  1    \Phi_{1}      up- and down-type quarks couple to separate doublets     X   Lepton-specific       Φ  2     subscript  normal-Φ  2    \Phi_{2}          Φ  2     subscript  normal-Φ  2    \Phi_{2}          Φ  1     subscript  normal-Φ  1    \Phi_{1}         Y   Flipped       Φ  2     subscript  normal-Φ  2    \Phi_{2}          Φ  1     subscript  normal-Φ  1    \Phi_{1}          Φ  2     subscript  normal-Φ  2    \Phi_{2}         Type III         Φ  1   ,   Φ  2       subscript  normal-Φ  1    subscript  normal-Φ  2     \Phi_{1},\Phi_{2}           Φ  1   ,   Φ  2       subscript  normal-Φ  1    subscript  normal-Φ  2     \Phi_{1},\Phi_{2}           Φ  1   ,   Φ  2       subscript  normal-Φ  1    subscript  normal-Φ  2     \Phi_{1},\Phi_{2}      Flavor-changing neutral currents at tree level     By convention,    Φ  2     subscript  normal-Φ  2    \Phi_{2}   is the doublet to which up-type quarks couple.
