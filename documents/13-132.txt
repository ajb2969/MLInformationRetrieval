   Leopoldt's conjecture      Leopoldt's conjecture   In algebraic number theory , Leopoldt's conjecture , introduced by , states that the p-adic regulator of a number field does not vanish. The p-adic regulator is an analogue of the usual regulator defined using p-adic logarithms instead of the usual logarithms, introduced by .  Leopoldt proposed a definition of a p-adic regulator  R p attached to K and a prime number p . The definition of R p uses an appropriate determinant with entries the p-adic logarithm of a generating set of units of K (up to torsion), in the manner of the usual regulator. The conjecture, which for general K is still open , then comes out as the statement that R p is not zero.  Formulation  Let K be a number field and for each prime  P of K above some fixed rational prime p , let U P denote the local units at P and let U 1, P denote the subgroup of principal units in U P . Set        U  1   =    ∏   P  |  p     U   1  ,  P      .       subscript  U  1     subscript  product   fragments  P  normal-|  p     subscript  U   1  P       U_{1}=\prod_{P|p}U_{1,P}.     Then let E 1 denote the set of global units ε that map to U 1 via the diagonal embedding of the global units in E .  Since    E  1     subscript  E  1    E_{1}   is a finite- index subgroup of the global units, it is an abelian group of rank      r  1   +   r  2    -  1         subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2    1    r_{1}+r_{2}-1   , where    r  1     subscript  r  1    r_{1}   is the number of real embeddings of   K   K   K   and    r  2     subscript  r  2    r_{2}   the number of pairs of complex embeddings. Leopoldt's conjecture states that the    ℤ  p     subscript  ℤ  p    \mathbb{Z}_{p}   -module rank of the closure of    E  1     subscript  E  1    E_{1}   embedded diagonally in    U  1     subscript  U  1    U_{1}   is also      r  1   +   r  2    -  1.         subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2    1.    r_{1}+r_{2}-1.     Leopoldt's conjecture is known in the special case where   K   K   K   is an abelian extension of   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   or an abelian extension of an imaginary quadratic number field :  reduced the abelian case to a p-adic version of Baker's theorem , which was proved shortly afterwards by .  has announced a proof of Leopoldt's conjecture for all CM-extensions of   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   .  expressed the residue of the p -adic Dedekind zeta function of a totally real field at s = 1 in terms of the p -adic regulator. As a consequence, Leopoldt's conjecture for those fields is equivalent to their p -adic Dedekind zeta functions having a simple pole at s = 1.  References         .      .
