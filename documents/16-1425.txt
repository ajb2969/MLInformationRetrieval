   Compact finite difference      Compact finite difference   The compact finite difference (CTFD) formulation , or Hermitian formulation , is a numerical method to solve the compressible Navier–Stokes equation . This method is both accurate and numerically very stable (especially for high-order derivatives ).  The expression for partial derivatives is developed and expressed mainly on dependent variables . An approach to increase accuracy of the estimates of the derivatives, in particular a problem involving shorter length scales or equivalently high frequencies, is to include the influence of the neighboring points in the calculations. This approach is analogous to the solution of a partial differential equation by an Implicit scheme to an explicit scheme. The resulting approximation is called a compact finite difference (CTFD) formulation or a Hermitian formulation.  Forward difference formulae and backward difference formulae are first order accurate, and central difference formula are second order accurate; compact finite difference formulae provide a more accurate method to solve equations .  Compact finite difference formulation  First order derivatives  Consider a three-point Hermitian formula involving the first derivative :        H   i  +  1    =    ∑   m  =   -  ℓ    ℓ    (     a  m    f   i  +  m     +    b  m    f   i  +  m   ′     )    =  0.

To obtain a third-order scheme, the coefficients of f i , f ' i , f '' i , f ''' i will be zero. If it is a fourth-order scheme, the coefficient of f’’’’ i will also be zero.

From the above equations, one can solve for a 1 , a 0 , a -1 and b 0 in the form of b 1 and b -1  The Truncation error will be:  Substituting (4) in the above equation results in:  The standard compact finite difference formula for first order derivatives of f(x) has a 3 point formulation [Δx/3] [f’ i-1 + 4f’ i + f’ i+1 ] = -f i-1 + f i+1 where f’ i = df(x i )/dx Similarly, for a fifth point formulation, take m=2 in the beginning.

(5) the equation for a 2nd order derivative will be:    Applications  Compact finite difference formulation is very frequently used to solve problems based on the Navier–Stokes equation , and is used extensively in solving hyperbolic equations.
