Compact finite difference

The compact finite difference (CTFD) formulation, or Hermitian formulation, is a numerical method to solve the compressible Navier–Stokes equation. This method is both accurate and numerically very stable (especially for high-order derivatives).
The expression for partial derivatives is developed and expressed mainly on dependent variables. An approach to increase accuracy of the estimates of the derivatives, in particular a problem involving shorter length scales or equivalently high frequencies, is to include the influence of the neighboring points in the calculations. This approach is analogous to the solution of a partial differential equation by an Implicit scheme to an explicit scheme. The resulting approximation is called a compact finite difference (CTFD) formulation or a Hermitian formulation.
Forward difference formulae and backward difference formulae are first order accurate, and central difference formula are second order accurate; compact finite difference formulae provide a more accurate method to solve equations.

First order derivatives
Consider a three-point Hermitian formula involving the first derivative:



Substituting the Taylor series expansion of the terms fi+1 and fi-1 results in:  In the above expression, only the first few terms are to be considered zero, and the rest of the higher order terms will be considered as the [Truncation error (numerical integration)|truncation error]] (TE). To obtain a third-order scheme, the coefficients of fi , f'i, f''i , f'''i will be zero. If it is a fourth-order scheme, the coefficient of f’’’’i will also be zero.

From the above equations, one can solve for a1 , a0 , a-1 and b0 in the form of b1 and b-1

 The Truncation error will be:

 Substituting (4) in the above equation results in:

 The standard compact finite difference formula for first order derivatives of f(x) has a 3 point formulation
 [Δx/3] [f’i-1 + 4f’i + f’i+1] = -fi-1 + fi+1
 where f’i = df(xi)/dx
 Similarly, for a fifth point formulation, take m=2 in the beginning.

Second order derivatives
Similar to the first order derivatives equation, i.e., eq. (5) the equation for a 2nd order derivative will be:


Applications
Compact finite difference formulation is very frequently used to solve problems based on the Navier–Stokes equation, and is used extensively in solving hyperbolic equations.
