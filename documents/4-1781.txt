Generalized eigenvector

In linear algebra, a generalized eigenvector of an n × n matrix

 
  is a vector which satisfies certain criteria which are more relaxed than those for an (ordinary) eigenvector.1
Let 
 
 
 
  be an n-dimensional vector space; let 
 
 
 
  be a linear map in 
 
 
 
 , the set of all linear maps from 
 
 
 
  into itself; and let 
 
 
 
  be the matrix representation of 
 
 
 
  with respect to some ordered basis.
There may not always exist a full set of n linearly independent eigenvectors of 
 
 
 
  that form a complete basis for 
 
 
 
 . That is, the matrix 
 
 
 
  may not be diagonalizable.23 This happens when the algebraic multiplicity of at least one eigenvalue

 
  is greater than its geometric multiplicity (the nullity of the matrix 
 
 
 
 , or the dimension of its nullspace). In this case, 
 
 
 
  is called a defective eigenvalue and 
 
 
 
  is called a defective matrix.4
A generalized eigenvector 
 
 
 
  corresponding to 
 
 
 
 , together with the matrix 
 
 
 
  generate a Jordan chain of linearly independent generalized eigenvectors which form a basis for an invariant subspace of 
 
 
 
 .567
Using generalized eigenvectors, a set of linearly independent eigenvectors of 
 
 
 
  can be extended, if necessary, to a complete basis for 
 
 
 
 .8 This basis can be used to determine an "almost diagonal matrix" 
 
 
 
  in Jordan normal form, similar to 
 
 
 
 , which is useful in computing certain matrix functions of 
 
 
 
 .9 The matrix 
 
 
 
  is also useful in solving the system of linear differential equations

 
  where 
 
 
 
  need not be diagonalizable.1011
Overview and definition
There are several equivalent ways to define an ordinary eigenvector.1213141516171819 For our purposes, an eigenvector 
 
 
 
  associated with an eigenvalue 
 
 
 
  of an 
 
 
 
  × 
 
 
 
  matrix 
 
 
 
  is a nonzero vector for which 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
 
  × 
 
 
identity matrix and 
 
 
 
  is the zero vector of length 
 
 
 
 .20 That is, 
 
 
 
  is in the kernel of the transformation

 
 . If 
 
 
 
  has 
 
 
 
  linearly independent eigenvectors, then 
 
 
 
  is similar to a diagonal matrix 
 
 
 
 . That is, there exists an invertible matrix

 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is diagonalizable through the similarity transformation 
 
 
 
 .2122 The matrix 
 
 
 
  is called a spectral matrix for 
 
 
 
 . The matrix 
 
 
 
  is called a modal matrix for 
 
 
 
 .23 Diagonalizable matrices are of particular interest since matrix functions of them can be computed easily.24
On the other hand, if 
 
 
 
  does not have 
 
 
 
  linearly independent eigenvectors associated with it, then 
 
 
 
  is not diagonalizable.2526
Definition: A vector 
 
 
 
  is a generalized eigenvector of rank m of the matrix 
 
 
 
  and corresponding to the eigenvalue 
 
 
 
  if



but


27
Clearly, a generalized eigenvector of rank 1 is an ordinary eigenvector.28 Every 
 
 
 
  × 
 
 
 
  matrix 
 
 
 
  has 
 
 
 
  linearly independent generalized eigenvectors associated with it and can be shown to be similar to an "almost diagonal" matrix 
 
 
 
  in Jordan normal form.29 That is, there exists an invertible matrix 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .30 The matrix 
 
 
 
  in this case is called a generalized modal matrix for 
 
 
 
 .31 If 
 
 
 
  is an eigenvalue of algebraic multiplicity 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  will have 
 
 
 
  linearly independent generalized eigenvectors corresponding to 
 
 
 
 .32 These results, in turn, provide a straightforward method for computing certain matrix functions of 
 
 
 
 .33
The set spanned by all generalized eigenvectors for a given 
 
 
 
 , forms the generalized eigenspace for 
 
 
 
 .34
Examples
Here are some examples to illustrate the concept of generalized eigenvectors. Some of the details will be described later.
Example 1
This example is simple but clearly illustrates the point. This type of matrix is used frequently in textbooks.353637 Suppose


 
  Then there is only one eigenvalue, 
 
 
 
 , and its algebraic multiplicity is m = 2.
There are several ways to see that there will be only one generalized eigenvector. The easiest is to notice that this matrix is in Jordan normal form but is not diagonal. Hence, this matrix is not diagonalizable. Since there is one superdiagonal entry, there will be one generalized eigenvector (or one could note that the vector space 
 
 
 
  is of dimension 2, so there can be only one generalized eigenvector). Alternatively, one could compute the dimension of the nullspace of 
 
 
 
  to be p = 1, and thus there are m – p = 1 generalized eigenvectors. (See the nullspace page.)
Computing the ordinary eigenvector 
 
 
 
  is left to the reader. (See the eigenvector page for examples.) Using this eigenvector, we compute the generalized eigenvector 
 
 
 
  by solving


 
  Writing out the values:


 
  This simplifies to



The element 
 
 
 
  has no restrictions. The generalized eigenvector is then 
 
 
 
 , where a can have any scalar value. The choice of a = 0 is usually the simplest.
Note that



so that 
 
 
 
  is a generalized eigenvector,



so that 
 
 
 
  is an ordinary eigenvector, and that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are linearly independent and hence constitute a basis for the vector space 
 
 
 
 
 .
Example 2
This example is more complex than Example 1. Unfortunately, it is a little difficult to construct an interesting example of low order.38 The matrix



has eigenvalues

 
  and 
 
 
 
  with algebraic multiplicities

 
  and 
 
 
 
 , but geometric multiplicities

 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The generalized eigenspaces of 
 
 
 
  are calculated below. 
 
 
 
  is the ordinary eigenvector associated with 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  is a generalized eigenvector associated with 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  is the ordinary eigenvector associated with 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are generalized eigenvectors associated with 
 
 
 
 .















This results in a basis for each of the generalized eigenspaces of 
 
 
 
 . Together the two chains of generalized eigenvectors span the space of all 5-dimensional column vectors.



An "almost diagonal" matrix 
 
 
 
  in Jordan normal form, similar to 
 
 
 
  is obtained as follows:






where 
 
 
 
  is a generalized modal matrix for 
 
 
 
 , the columns of 
 
 
 
  are a canonical basis for 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 
 .39
Jordan chains
Definition: Let 
 
 
 
  be a generalized eigenvector of rank m corresponding to the matrix 
 
 
 
  and the eigenvalue 
 
 
 
 . The chain generated by

 
  is a set of vectors 
 
 
 
 
  given by




Thus, in general,




The vector 
 
 
 
 , given by (), is a generalized eigenvector of rank j corresponding to the eigenvalue 
 
 
 
 . A chain is a linearly independent set of vectors.40
Canonical basis
Definition: A set of n linearly independent generalized eigenvectors is a canonical basis if it is composed entirely of Jordan chains.
Thus, once we have determined that a generalized eigenvector of rank m is in a canonical basis, it follows that the m − 1 vectors 
 
 
 
  that are in the Jordan chain generated by 
 
 
 
  are also in the canonical basis.41
Let 
 
 
 
 
  be an eigenvalue of 
 
 
 
  of algebraic multiplicity 
 
 
 
 . First, find the ranks (matrix ranks) of the matrices 
 
 
 
 . The integer 
 
 
 
  is determined to be the first integer for which 
 
 
 
 
  has rank 
 
 
 
  (n being the number of rows or columns of 
 
 
 
 , that is, 
 
 
 
  is n × n).
Now define



The variable 
 
 
 
 
  designates the number of linearly independent generalized eigenvectors of rank k corresponding to the eigenvalue 
 
 
 
  that will appear in a canonical basis for 
 
 
 
 . Note that


 
 .42
Computation of generalized eigenvectors
In the preceding sections we have seen techniques for obtaining the n linearly independent generalized eigenvectors of a canonical basis for the vector space 
 
 
 
  associated with an n × n matrix 
 
 
 
 
 . These techniques can be combined into a procedure:

Solve the characteristic equation of 
 
 
 
  for eigenvalues 
 
 
 
  and their algebraic multiplicities 
 
 
 
 ;
 
For each 
 
 

Determine 
 
 
 
 
 ;
 
Determine 
 
 
 
 ;
 
Determine 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 ;
 
Determine each Jordan chain for 
 
 
 
 ;
 



Example 3
The matrix



has an eigenvalue 
 
 
 
  of algebraic multiplicity 
 
 
 
  and an eigenvalue 
 
 
 
  of algebraic multiplicity 
 
 
 
 . We also have n = 4. For 
 
 
 
  we have 
 
 
 
 .









The first integer 
 
 
 
  for which 
 
 
 
  has rank 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 .
We now define









Consequently, there will be three linearly independent generalized eigenvectors; one each of ranks 3, 2 and 1. Since 
 
 
 
  corresponds to a single chain of three linearly independent generalized eigenvectors, we know that there is a generalized eigenvector 
 
 
 
  of rank 3 corresponding to 
 
 
 
  such that







but







Equations () and () represent linear systems that can be solved for 
 
 
 
 . Let



Then



and



Thus, in order to satisfy the conditions () and (), we must have 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . No restrictions are placed on 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . By choosing 
 
 
 
 , we obtain



as a generalized eigenvector of rank 3 corresponding to 
 
 
 
 . Note that it is possible to obtain infinitely many other generalized eigenvectors of rank 3 by choosing different values of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
 . Our first choice, however, is the simplest.43
Now using equations (), we obtain 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  as generalized eigenvectors of rank 2 and 1 respectively, where



and



The simple eigenvalue

 
  can be dealt with using standard techniques and has an ordinary eigenvector



A canonical basis for 
 
 
 
  is



 
  and 
 
 
 
  are generalized eigenvectors associated with 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  is the ordinary eigenvector associated with 
 
 
 
 .
It should be noted that this is a fairly simple example. In general, the numbers 
 
 
 
  of linearly independent generalized eigenvectors of rank k will not always be equal. That is, there may be several chains of different lengths corresponding to a particular eigenvalue.44
Generalized modal matrix
Let 
 
 
 
  be an n × n matrix. A generalized modal matrix

 
  for 
 
 
 
  is an n × n matrix whose columns, considered as vectors, form a canonical basis for 
 
 
 
  and appear in 
 
 
 
  according to the following rules:

All Jordan chains consisting of one vector (that is, one vector in length) appear in the first columns of 
 
 
 
 .
All vectors of one chain appear together in adjacent columns of 
 
 
 
 .
Each chain appears in 
 
 
 
  in order of increasing rank (that is, the generalized eigenvector of rank 1 appears before the generalized eigenvector of rank 2 of the same chain, which appears before the generalized eigenvector of rank 3 of the same chain, etc.).45

Jordan Normal Form
  Let 
 
 
 
  be an n-dimensional vector space; let 
 
 
 
  be a linear map in 
 
 
 
 , the set of all linear maps from 
 
 
 
  into itself; and let 
 
 
 
  be the matrix representation of 
 
 
 
  with respect to some ordered basis. It can be shown that if the characteristic polynomial

 
  of 
 
 
 
  factors into linear factors, so that 
 
 
 
  has the form



where 
 
 
 
  are the distinct eigenvalues of 
 
 
 
 , then each 
 
 
 
  is the algebraic multiplicity of its corresponding eigenvalue 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is similar to a matrix 
 
 
 
  in Jordan normal form, where each 
 
 
 
  appears 
 
 
 
  consecutive times on the diagonal, and each entry above each 
 
 
 
  (that is, on the superdiagonal) is either 0 or 1; the entry above the first occurrence of each 
 
 
 
  is always 0. All other entries are zero. The matrix 
 
 
 
  is as close as one can come to a diagonalization of 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is diagonalizable, then all entries above the diagonal are zero.46 Note that some textbooks have the ones on the subdiagonal, that is, immediately below the main diagonal instead of on the superdiagonal. The eigenvalues are still on the main diagonal.4748
Every n × n matrix 
 
 
 
  is similar to a matrix 
 
 
 
  in Jordan normal form, obtained through the similarity transformation 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a generalized modal matrix for 
 
 
 
 .49
Example 4
Find a matrix in Jordan normal form that is similar to



Solution: The characteristic equation of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , hence, 
 
 
 
  is an eigenvalue of algebraic multiplicity three. Following the procedures of the previous sections, we find that



and



Thus, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , which implies that a canonical basis for 
 
 
 
  will contain one linearly independent generalized eigenvector of rank 2 and two linearly independent generalized eigenvectors of rank 1, or equivalently, one chain of two vectors 
 
 
 
  and one chain of one vector 
 
 
 
 . Designating 
 
 
 
 , we find that



and



where 
 
 
 
  is a generalized modal matrix for 
 
 
 
 , the columns of 
 
 
 
  are a canonical basis for 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 .50 Note that since generalized eigenvectors themselves are not unique, and since some of the columns of both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  may be interchanged, it follows that both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are not unique.51
Example 5
In Example 3, we found a canonical basis of linearly independent generalized eigenvectors for a matrix 
 
 
 
 . A generalized modal matrix for 
 
 
 
  is

Applications
Matrix functions
Three of the most fundamental operations which can be performed on square matrices are matrix addition, multiplication by a scalar, and matrix multiplication.52 These are exactly those operations necessary for defining a polynomial function of an n × n matrix 
 
 
 
 .53 If we recall from basic calculus that many functions can be written as a Maclaurin series, then we can define more general functions of matrices quite easily.54 If 
 
 
 
  is diagonalizable, that is



with



then



and the evaluation of the Maclaurin series for functions of 
 
 
 
  is greatly simplified.55 For example, to obtain any power k of 
 
 
 
 
 , we need only compute 
 
 
 
 , premultiply 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 , and postmultiply the result by 
 
 
 
 .56
Using generalized eigenvectors, we can obtain the Jordan normal form for 
 
 
 
 
  and these results can be generalized to a straightforward method for computing functions of nondiagonalizable matrices.57 (See Matrix function#Jordan decomposition.)
Differential equations
Consider the problem of solving the system of linear ordinary differential equations




where


 
   and  
 
 

If the matrix

In this case, the general solution is given by

















In the general case, we try to diagonalize 
 
 
 
  and reduce the system () to a system like () as follows. If 
 
 
 
  is diagonalizable, we have 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a modal matrix for 
 
 
 
 . Substituting 
 
 
 
 , equation () takes the form 
 
 
 
 , or




where




The solution of () is

















The solution 
 
 
 
  of () is then obtained using the relation ().58
On the other hand, if 
 
 
 
  is not diagonalizable, we choose 
 
 
 
  to be a generalized modal matrix for 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
  is the Jordan normal form of

  has the form




where the 
 
 
 
  are the eigenvalues from the main diagonal of 
 
 
 
  and the 
 
 
 
  are the ones and zeros from the superdiagonal of 
 
 
 
 . The system () is often more easily solved than (). We may solve the last equation in () for 
 
 
 
 , obtaining 
 
 
 
 . We then substitute this solution for 
 
 
 
  into the next to last equation in () and solve for 
 
 
 
 . Continuing this procedure, we work through () from the last equation to the first, solving the entire system for 
 
 
 
 . The solution 
 
 
 
  is then obtained using the relation ().59
