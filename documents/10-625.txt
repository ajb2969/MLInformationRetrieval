   Ureidoglycolate dehydrogenase      Ureidoglycolate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , an ureidoglycolate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-ureidoglycolate + NAD(P) +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   oxalureate + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are (S)-ureidoglycolate , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are oxalureate , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-ureidoglycolate:NAD(P) + oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
