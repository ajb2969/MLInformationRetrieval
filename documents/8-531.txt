Hermitian variety

Hermitian varieties are in a sense a generalisation of quadrics, and occur naturally in the theory of polarities.
Definition
Let K be a field with an involutive automorphism

 
 . Let n be an integer 
 
 
 
  and V be an (n+1)-dimensional vectorspace over K.
A Hermitian variety H in PG(V) is a set of points of which the representing vector lines consisting of isotropic points of a non-trivial Hermitian sesquilinear form on V.
Representation
Let 
 
 
 
  be a basis of V. If a point p in the projective space has homogeneous coordinates 
 
 
 
  with respect to this basis, it is on the Hermitian variety if and only if :



where 
 
 
 
  and not all 
 
 

If one construct the Hermitian matrix A with 
 
 
 
 , the equation can be written in a compact way :



where 
 
 

Tangent spaces and singularity
Let p be a point on the Hermitian variety H. A line L through p is by definition tangent when it is contains only one point (p itself) of the variety or lies completely on the variety. One can prove that these lines form a subspace, either a hyperplane of the full space. In the latter case, the point is singular.
