   Hermitian variety      Hermitian variety   Hermitian varieties are in a sense a generalisation of quadrics , and occur naturally in the theory of polarities .  Definition  Let K be a field with an involutive automorphism    θ   θ   \theta   . Let n be an integer     ≥  1      absent  1    \geq 1   and V be an (n+1) -dimensional vectorspace over K .  A Hermitian variety H in PG(V) is a set of points of which the representing vector lines consisting of isotropic points of a non-trivial Hermitian sesquilinear form on V .  Representation  Let     e  0   ,   e  1   ,  …  ,   e  n       subscript  e  0    subscript  e  1   normal-…   subscript  e  n     e_{0},e_{1},\ldots,e_{n}   be a basis of V . If a point p in the projective space has homogeneous coordinates    (   X  0   ,  …  ,   X  n   )      subscript  X  0   normal-…   subscript  X  n     (X_{0},\ldots,X_{n})   with respect to this basis, it is on the Hermitian variety if and only if :        ∑    i  ,  j   =  0   n     a   i  j     X  i    X  j  θ     =  0        superscript   subscript      i  j   0    n      subscript  a    i  j     subscript  X  i    superscript   subscript  X  j   θ     0    \sum_{i,j=0}^{n}a_{ij}X_{i}X_{j}^{\theta}=0     where     a   i  j    =   a   j  i   θ        subscript  a    i  j     superscript   subscript  a    j  i    θ     a_{ij}=a_{ji}^{\theta}   and not all     a   i  j    =  0       subscript  a    i  j    0    a_{ij}=0     If one construct the Hermitian matrix  A with     A   i  j    =   a   i  j         subscript  A    i  j     subscript  a    i  j      A_{ij}=a_{ij}   , the equation can be written in a compact way :        X  t   A   X  θ    =  0         superscript  X  t   A   superscript  X  θ    0    X^{t}AX^{\theta}=0     where     X  =   [      X  0        X  1       ⋮       X  n      ]    .      X     subscript  X  0      subscript  X  1     normal-⋮     subscript  X  n       X=\begin{bmatrix}X_{0}\\
 X_{1}\\
 \vdots\\
 X_{n}\end{bmatrix}.     Tangent spaces and singularity  Let p be a point on the Hermitian variety H . A line L through p is by definition tangent when it is contains only one point ( p itself) of the variety or lies completely on the variety. One can prove that these lines form a subspace, either a hyperplane of the full space. In the latter case, the point is singular.  "  Category:Algebraic varieties
