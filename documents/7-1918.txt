Quasi-triangular Quasi-Hopf algebra

A quasi-triangular quasi-Hopf algebra is a specialized form of a quasi-Hopf algebra defined by the Ukrainian mathematician Vladimir Drinfeld in 1989. It is also a generalized form of a quasi-triangular Hopf algebra.
A quasi-triangular quasi-Hopf algebra is a set 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a quasi-Hopf algebra and 
 
 
 
  known as the R-matrix, is an invertible element such that









so that 
 
 
 
  is the switch map and






where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The quasi-Hopf algebra becomes triangular if in addition, 
 
 
 
 .
The twisting of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  is the same as for a quasi-Hopf algebra, with the additional definition of the twisted R-matrix
A quasi-triangular (resp. triangular) quasi-Hopf algebra with 
 
 
 
  is a quasi-triangular (resp. triangular) Hopf algebra as the latter two conditions in the definition reduce the conditions of quasi-triangularity of a Hopf algebra .
Similarly to the twisting properties of the quasi-Hopf algebra, the property of being quasi-triangular or triangular quasi-Hopf algebra is preserved by twisting.
