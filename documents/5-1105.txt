   Weak isospin      Weak isospin   In particle physics , weak isospin is a quantum number relating to the weak interaction , and parallels the idea of isospin under the strong interaction . Weak isospin is usually given the symbol T or I with the third component written as T z , T 3 , I z or I 3 . 1 Weak isospin is a complement of the weak hypercharge , which unifies weak interactions with electromagnetic interactions.  The weak isospin conservation law relates the conservation of T 3 ; all weak interactions must preserve T 3 . It is also conserved by the other interactions and is therefore a conserved quantity in general. For this reason T 3 is more important than T and often the term "weak isospin" refers to the "3rd component of weak isospin".  Relation with chirality  Fermions with negative chirality (also called left-handed fermions) have T =    1  /  2      1  2    {1}/{2}   and can be grouped into doublets with T 3 = ±    1  /  2      1  2    {1}/{2}   that behave the same way under the weak interaction . For example, up-type quarks ( u , c , t ) have T 3 = +    1  /  2      1  2    {1}/{2}   and always transform into down-type quarks ( d , s , b ), which have T 3 = −    1  /  2      1  2    {1}/{2}   , and vice versa. On the other hand, a quark never decays weakly into a quark of the same T 3 . Something similar happens with left-handed leptons , which exist as doublets containing a charged lepton (, , ) with T 3 = −    1  /  2      1  2    {1}/{2}   and a neutrino (, , ) with T 3 =    1  /  2      1  2    {1}/{2}   .  Fermions with positive chirality (also called right-handed fermions) have T = 0 and form singlets that do not undergo weak interactions.  Electric charge, Q , is related to weak isospin, T 3 , and weak hypercharge , Y W , by       Q  =    T  3   +    Y  W   2     .      Q     subscript  T  3      subscript  Y  normal-W   2      Q=T_{3}+\frac{Y_{\mathrm{W}}}{2}.     Weak isospin and the W bosons  The symmetry associated with spin is SU(2) . This requires gauge bosons to transform between weak isospin charges: bosons ,  and . This implies that  bosons have a T = 1, with three different values of T 3 .    boson ( T 3 = +1) is emitted in transitions {( T 3 = +    1  /  2      1  2    {1}/{2}   ) → ( T 3 = −    1  /  2      1  2    {1}/{2}   )},   boson ( T 3 = −1) is emitted in transitions {( T 3 = −    1  /  2      1  2    {1}/{2}   ) → ( T 3 = +    1  /  2      1  2    {1}/{2}   )}.   boson ( T 3 = 0) would be emitted in reactions where T 3 does not change. However, under electroweak unification, the  boson mixes with the weak hypercharge gauge boson , resulting in the observed  boson and the photon of Quantum Electrodynamics .
