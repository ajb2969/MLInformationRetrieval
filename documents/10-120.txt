   CCWAPSS      CCWAPSS   The Common Criteria Web Application Security Scoring (CCWAPSS) is a scoring scale developed by security consultants to evaluate the security level of a web application regarding penetration tests and security assessments.  The main benefit of this scoring method is to fight against the « gaussienne » inclination using a restricted granularity that forces the auditor to clear-cut score (there is no medium choice).  The 11 scoring criteria  This scale is based on 11 documented scoring criteria; each one is described in the OWASP project :       S  c  o  r  e   =    10  -   ∑   R  i  s  k  s     +   (   ∑    E  x  c  e  l  l  e  n  t  s   /   ∑   R  i  s  k  s      )          S  c  o  r  e       10      R  i  s  k  s           E  x  c  e  l  l  e  n  t  s       R  i  s  k  s         Score=10-\sum Risks+(\sum Excellents/\sum Risks)     Each criterion is relative to a section of the OWASP Guide 3.0.  1 - Authentication  2 - Authorization  3 - User’s Input Sanitization  4 - Error Handling and Information leakage  5 - Passwords/PIN Complexity  6 - User’s data confidentiality  7 - Session mechanism  8 - Patch management  9 - Administration interfaces  10 - Communication security  11 - Third-Party services exposure  See also   The CCWAPSS blog  The OWASP Guide   "  Category:Security
