Complex-oriented cohomology theory

In algebraic topology, a complex-orientable cohomology theory is a multiplicative cohomology theory E such that the restriction map 
 
 
 
  is surjective. An element of 
 
 
 
  that restricts to the canonical generator of the reduced theory 
 
 
 
  is called a complex orientation. The notion is central to Quillen's work relating cohomology to formal group laws.
If 
 
 
 
 , then E is complex-orientable.
Examples:

An ordinary cohomology with any coefficient ring R is complex orientable, as 
 
 
 
 .
A complex K-theory, denoted by K, is complex-orientable, as 
 
 
 
  (Bott periodicity theorem)
Complex cobordism, whose spectrum is denoted by MU, is complex-orientable.

A complex orientation, call it t, gives rise to a formal group law as follows: let m be the multiplication


 
  where 
 
 
 
  denotes a line passing through x in the underlying vector space 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 . Viewing


 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be the pullback of t along m. It lives in


 
  and one can show it is a formal group law (e.g., satisfies associativity).
