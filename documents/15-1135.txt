   Geraniol 8-hydroxylase      Geraniol 8-hydroxylase   Geraniol 8-hydroxylase (, CYP76B6 , G10H , CrG10H , SmG10H ) is an enzyme with system name geraniol,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (8-hydroxylating) . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   geraniol + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    (6E)-8-hydroxygeraniol + NADP + + H 2 O   Geraniol 8-hydroxylase requires cytochrome P-450 .
