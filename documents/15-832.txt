CDP-paratose synthase

CDP-paratose synthase (, rfbS (gene)) is an enzyme with system name CDP-alpha-D-paratose:NADP+ 4-oxidoreductase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

CDP-alpha-D-paratose + NADP+

 
  CDP-4-dehydro-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-glucose + NADPH + H+


This enzyme participates in synthesis of paratose and tyvelose.
