   CDP-paratose synthase      CDP-paratose synthase   CDP-paratose synthase (, rfbS (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name CDP-alpha-D-paratose:NADP + 4-oxidoreductase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   CDP-alpha-D-paratose + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CDP-4-dehydro-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-glucose + NADPH + H +    This enzyme participates in synthesis of paratose and tyvelose .
