2-methylcitrate dehydratase (2-methyl-trans-aconitate forming)

2-methylcitrate dehydratase (2-methyl-trans-aconitate forming) () is an enzyme with system name '' (2S,3S)-2-hydroxybutane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate hydro-lyase (2-methyl-trans-aconitate forming)''.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2S,3S)-2-methylcitrate 
 
 
 
  2-methyl-trans-aconitate + H2O
 

This enzyme catalyses the dehydration of (2S,3S)-2-methylcitrate, forming the trans isomer of 2-methyl-aconitate.
