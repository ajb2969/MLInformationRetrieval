Canonical basis

In mathematics, a canonical basis is a basis of an algebraic structure that is canonical in a sense that depends on the precise context:

In a coordinate space, and more generally in a free module, it refers to the standard basis defined by the Kronecker delta.
In a polynomial ring, it refers to its standard basis given by the monomials, 
 
 
 
 .
For finite extension fields, it means the polynomial basis.
In linear algebra, it refers to a set of n linearly independent generalized eigenvectors of an n×n matrix 
 
 
 
 , if the set is composed entirely of Jordan chains.1

Representation theory
In representation theory there are several basis that are called "canonical", e.g. Lusztig's canonical basis and closely related Kashiwara's crystal basis in quantum groups and their representations. There is a general concept underlying these basis:
Consider the ring of integral Laurent polynomials

 
  with its two subrings 
 
 
 
  and the automorphism 
 
 
 
  that is defined by 
 
 
 
 .
A precanonical structure on a free 
 
 
 
 -module 
 
 
 
  consists of

A standard basis 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 ,
A partial order on 
 
 
 
  that is interval finite, i.e. 
 
 
 
  is finite for all 
 
 
 
 ,
A dualization operation, i.e. a bijection 
 
 
 
  of order two that is 
 
 
 
 -semilinear and will be denoted by 
 
 
 
  as well.

If a precanonical structure is given, then one can define the 
 
 
 
  submodule 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 .
A canonical basis at 
 
 
 of the precanonical structure is then a 
 
 
 
 -basis 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  that satisfies:



 
  and


 
 and 
 
 


for all 
 
 
 
 . A canonical basis at 
 
 
 is analogously defined to be a basis 
 
 
 
  that satisfies



 
  and


 
  and 
 
 


for all 
 
 
 
 . The naming "at 
 
 
 
 " alludes to the fact 
 
 
 
  and hence the "specialization" 
 
 
 
  corresponds to quotienting out the relation 
 
 
 
 .
One can show that there exists at most one canonical basis at v=0 (and at most one at 
 
 
 
 ) for each precanonical structure. A sufficient condition for existence is that the polynomials 
 
 
 
  defined by 
 
 
 
  satisfy 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
A canonical basis at v=0 (
 
 
 
 ) induces an isomorphism from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  (
 
 
 
  respectively).
Examples
Quantum groups
The canonical basis of quantum groups in the sense of Lusztig and Kashiwara are canonical basis at 
 
 
 
 .
Hecke algebras
Let 
 
 
 
  be a Coxeter group. The corresponding Iwahori-Hecke algebra

 
  has the standard basis 
 
 
 
 , the group is partially ordered by the Bruhat order which is interval finite and has a dualization operation defined by 
 
 
 
 . This is a precanonical structure on 
 
 
 
  that satisfies the sufficient condition above and the corresponding canonical basis of 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
  is the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis

 
  with 
 
 
 
  being the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials.
Linear algebra
If we are given an n × n matrix

 
  and wish to find a matrix 
 
 
 
  in Jordan normal form, similar to 
 
 
 
 , we are interested only in sets of linearly independent generalized eigenvectors. A matrix in Jordan normal form is an "almost diagonal matrix," that is, as close to diagonal as possible. A diagonal matrix

 
  is a special case of a matrix in Jordan normal form. An ordinary eigenvector is a special case of a generalized eigenvector.
Every n × n matrix 
 
 
 
  possesses n linearly independent generalized eigenvectors. Generalized eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent. If 
 
 
 
  is an eigenvalue of 
 
 
 
  of algebraic multiplicity

 
 , then 
 
 
 
  will have 
 
 
 
  linearly independent generalized eigenvectors corresponding to 
 
 
 
 .
For any given n × n matrix 
 
 
 
 , there are infinitely many ways to pick the n linearly independent generalized eigenvectors. If they are chosen in a particularly judicious manner, we can use these vectors to show that 
 
 
 
  is similar to a matrix in Jordan normal form. In particular,
Definition: A set of n linearly independent generalized eigenvectors is a canonical basis if it is composed entirely of Jordan chains.
Thus, once we have determined that a generalized eigenvector of rank m is in a canonical basis, it follows that the m − 1 vectors 
 
 
 
  that are in the Jordan chain generated by 
 
 
 
  are also in the canonical basis.2
Computation
Let 
 
 
 
  be an eigenvalue of 
 
 
 
  of algebraic multiplicity 
 
 
 
 . First, find the ranks (matrix ranks) of the matrices 
 
 
 
 . The integer 
 
 
 
  is determined to be the first integer for which 
 
 
 
  has rank 
 
 
 
  (n being the number of rows or columns of 
 
 
 
 , that is, 
 
 
 
  is n × n).
Now define



The variable 
 
 
 
  designates the number of linearly independent generalized eigenvectors of rank k (generalized eigenvector rank; see generalized eigenvector) corresponding to the eigenvalue 
 
 
 
  that will appear in a canonical basis for 
 
 
 
 . Note that



Once we have determined the number of generalized eigenvectors of each rank that a canonical basis has, we can obtain the vectors explicitly (see generalized eigenvector).3
Example
This example illustrates a canonical basis with two Jordan chains. Unfortunately, it is a little difficult to construct an interesting example of low order.4 The matrix



has eigenvalues 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with algebraic multiplicities 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , but geometric multiplicities

 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
For 
 
 
 
  we have 
 
 



 
  has rank 5,


 
  has rank 4,


 
  has rank 3,


 
  has rank 2.
Therefore 
 
 













Thus, a canonical basis for 
 
 
 
  will have, corresponding to 
 
 
 
  one generalized eigenvector each of ranks 4, 3, 2 and 1.
For 
 
 
 
  we have 
 
 



 
  has rank 5,


 
  has rank 4.
Therefore 
 
 







Thus, a canonical basis for 
 
 
 
  will have, corresponding to 
 
 
 
  one generalized eigenvector each of ranks 2 and 1.
A canonical basis for 
 
 
 
  is



 
  is the ordinary eigenvector associated with 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are generalized eigenvectors associated with 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  is the ordinary eigenvector associated with 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  is a generalized eigenvector associated with

A matrix 
 
 
 
  in Jordan normal form, similar to 
 
 
 
  is obtained as follows:






where the matrix 
 
 
 
  is a generalized modal matrix for 
 
 
 
  and
