   Sierpiński's constant      Sierpiński's constant   Sierpiński's constant is a mathematical constant usually denoted as K . One way of defining it is by limiting the expression:      K  =    lim   n  →  ∞     [     ∑   k  =  1   n      r  2    (  k  )    k    -   π   ln  n     ]        K    subscript    normal-→  n      delimited-[]      superscript   subscript     k  1    n        subscript  r  2   k   k      π    n         K=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left[\sum_{k=1}^{n}{r_{2}(k)\over k}-\pi\ln n\right]     where r 2 ( k ) is a number of representations of k as a sum of the form a 2 + b 2 for natural  a and b .  It can be given in closed form as:     K   K   \displaystyle K     where   G   G   G   is Gauss's constant and   γ   γ   \gamma   is the Euler-Mascheroni constant .
