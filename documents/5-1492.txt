Sierpiński's constant

Sierpiński's constant is a mathematical constant usually denoted as K. One way of defining it is by limiting the expression:



where r2(k) is a number of representations of k as a sum of the form a2 + b2 for natural a and b.
It can be given in closed form as:



where 
 
 
 
  is Gauss's constant and 
 
 
 
  is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.
