   Sub-Riemannian manifold      Sub-Riemannian manifold   In mathematics , a sub-Riemannian manifold is a certain type of generalization of a Riemannian manifold . Roughly speaking, to measure distances in a sub-Riemannian manifold, you are allowed to go only along curves tangent to so-called horizontal subspaces .  Sub-Riemannian manifolds (and so, a fortiori , Riemannian manifolds) carry a natural intrinsic metric called the metric of Carnot–Carathéodory . The Hausdorff dimension of such metric spaces is always an integer and larger than its topological dimension (unless it is actually a Riemannian manifold).  Sub-Riemannian manifolds often occur in the study of constrained systems in classical mechanics , such as the motion of vehicles on a surface, the motion of robot arms, and the orbital dynamics of satellites. Geometric quantities such as the Berry phase may be understood in the language of sub-Riemannian geometry. The Heisenberg group , important to quantum mechanics , carries a natural sub-Riemannian structure.  Definitions  By a distribution on   M   M   M   we mean a subbundle of the tangent bundle of   M   M   M   .  Given a distribution     H   (  M  )    ⊂   T   (  M  )          H  M     T  M     H(M)\subset T(M)   a vector field in     H   (  M  )    ⊂   T   (  M  )          H  M     T  M     H(M)\subset T(M)   is called horizontal . A curve   γ   γ   \gamma   on   M   M   M   is called horizontal if      γ  ˙    (  t  )    ∈    H   γ   (  t  )      (  M  )           normal-˙  γ   t      subscript  H    γ  t    M     \dot{\gamma}(t)\in H_{\gamma(t)}(M)   for any   t   t   t   .  A distribution on    H   (  M  )       H  M    H(M)   is called completely non-integrable if for any    x  ∈  M      x  M    x\in M   we have that any tangent vector can be presented as a linear combination of vectors of the following types      A   (  x  )    ,    [  A  ,  B  ]    (  x  )    ,    [  A  ,   [  B  ,  C  ]   ]    (  x  )    ,    [  A  ,   [  B  ,   [  C  ,  D  ]   ]   ]    (  x  )    ,  …   ∈    T  x    (  M  )           A  x      A  B   x      A   B  C    x      A   B   C  D     x   normal-…      subscript  T  x   M     A(x),\ [A,B](x),\ [A,[B,C]](x),\ [A,[B,[C,D]]](x),\ldots\in T_{x}(M)   where all vector fields    A  ,  B  ,  C  ,  D  ,  …     A  B  C  D  normal-…    A,B,C,D,\dots   are horizontal.  A sub-Riemannian manifold is a triple    (  M  ,  H  ,  g  )     M  H  g    (M,H,g)   , where   M   M   M   is a differentiable manifold ,   H   H   H   is a completely non-integrable "horizontal" distribution and   g   g   g   is a smooth section of positive-definite quadratic forms on   H   H   H   .  Any sub-Riemannian manifold carries the natural intrinsic metric , called the metric of Carnot–Carathéodory , defined as        d   (  x  ,  y  )    =   inf    ∫  0  1       g   (    γ  ˙    (  t  )    ,    γ  ˙    (  t  )    )      d  t      ,        d   x  y     infimum    superscript   subscript   0   1         g      normal-˙  γ   t      normal-˙  γ   t      d  t       d(x,y)=\inf\int_{0}^{1}\sqrt{g(\dot{\gamma}(t),\dot{\gamma}(t))}\,dt,   where infimum is taken along all horizontal curves     γ  :    [  0  ,  1  ]   →  M      normal-:  γ   normal-→   0  1   M     \gamma:[0,1]\to M   such that     γ   (  0  )    =  x        γ  0   x    \gamma(0)=x   ,     γ   (  1  )    =  y        γ  1   y    \gamma(1)=y   .  Examples  A position of a car on the plane is determined by three parameters: two coordinates   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   for the location and an angle   α   α   \alpha   which describes the orientation of the car. Therefore, the position of the car can be described by a point in a manifold        ℝ  2   ×   S  1    .       superscript  ℝ  2    superscript  S  1     \mathbb{R}^{2}\times S^{1}.     One can ask, what is the minimal distance one should drive to get from one position to another? This defines a Carnot–Carathéodory metric on the manifold        ℝ  2   ×   S  1    .       superscript  ℝ  2    superscript  S  1     \mathbb{R}^{2}\times S^{1}.     A closely related example of a sub-Riemannian metric can be constructed on a Heisenberg group : Take two elements   α   α   \alpha   and   β   β   \beta   in the corresponding Lie algebra such that      {  α  ,  β  ,   [  α  ,  β  ]   }     α  β   α  β     \{\alpha,\beta,[\alpha,\beta]\}     spans the entire algebra. The horizontal distribution   H   H   H   spanned by left shifts of   α   α   \alpha   and   β   β   \beta   is completely non-integrable . Then choosing any smooth positive quadratic form on   H   H   H   gives a sub-Riemannian metric on the group.  Properties  For every sub-Riemannian manifold, there exists a Hamiltonian , called the sub-Riemannian Hamiltonian , constructed out of the metric for the manifold. Conversely, every such quadratic Hamiltonian induces a sub-Riemannian manifold. The existence of geodesics of the corresponding Hamilton–Jacobi equations for the sub-Riemannian Hamiltonian is given by the Chow–Rashevskii theorem .
