   Duffin–Schaeffer conjecture      Duffin–Schaeffer conjecture   The Duffin–Schaeffer conjecture is an important conjecture in metric number theory proposed by R. J. Duffin and A. C. Schaeffer in 1941. 1 It states that if    f  :   ℕ  →   ℝ  +       normal-:  f   normal-→  ℕ   superscript  ℝ       f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{+}   is a real-valued function taking on positive values, then for almost all    α   α   \alpha   (with respect to Lebesgue measure ), the inequality       |   α  -   p  q    |   <    f   (  q  )    q           α    p  q         f  q   q     \left|\alpha-\frac{p}{q}\right|<\frac{f(q)}{q}     has infinitely many solutions in co-prime integers    p  ,  q     p  q    p,q   with    q  >  0      q  0    q>0   if and only if the sum         ∑   q  =  1   ∞    f   (  q  )     φ   (  q  )    q     =  ∞   .        superscript   subscript     q  1        f  q      φ  q   q        \sum_{q=1}^{\infty}f(q)\frac{\varphi(q)}{q}=\infty.     Here    φ   (  q  )       φ  q    \varphi(q)   is the Euler totient function .  The full conjecture remains unsolved. However, a higher-dimensional analogue of this conjecture has been resolved. 2 3 4  Progress  The implication from the existence of the rational approximations to the divergence of the series follows from the Borel–Cantelli lemma . 5 The converse implication is the crux of the conjecture. 6 There have been many partial results of the Duffin–Schaeffer conjecture established to date. Paul Erdős established in 1970 that the conjecture holds if there exists a constant    c  >  0      c  0    c>0   such that for every integer   n   n   n   we have either     f   (  n  )    =   c  /  n         f  n     c  n     f(n)=c/n   or     f   (  n  )    =  0        f  n   0    f(n)=0   . 7 8 This was strengthened by Jeffrey Vaaler in 1978 to the case     f   (  n  )    =   O   (   n   -  1    )          f  n     O   superscript  n    1       f(n)=O(n^{-1})   . 9 10 More recently, this was strengthened to the conjecture being true whenever there exists some    ϵ  >  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon>0   such that the series      ∑   n  =  1   ∞      (    f   (  n  )    n   )    1  +  ϵ    φ   (  n  )     =  ∞        superscript   subscript     n  1         superscript      f  n   n     1  ϵ    φ  n       \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\frac{f(n)}{n}\right)^{1+\epsilon}\varphi(n)=\infty   . This was done by Haynes, Pollington, and Velani. 11  In 2006, Beresnevich and Velani proved that a Hausdorff measure analogue of the Duffin–Schaeffer conjecture is equivalent to the original Duffin–Schaeffer conjecture, which is a priori weaker.
