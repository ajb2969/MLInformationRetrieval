ACP-SH:acetate ligase

ACP-SH:acetate ligase (, HS-acyl-carrier protein:acetate ligase, [acyl-carrier protein]:acetate ligase, MadH) is an enzyme with system name acetate:(acyl-carrier-protein) ligase (AMP-forming).1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

ATP + acetate + an [acyl-carrier protein] 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + an acetyl-[acyl-carrier protein]
 

This enzyme, from the anaerobic bacterium Malonomonas rubra, is a component of the multienzyme complex EC 4.1.1.89, biotin-dependent malonate decarboxylase.
