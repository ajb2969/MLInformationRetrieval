Lehmer's totient problem

In mathematics, Lehmer's totient problem, named for D. H. Lehmer, asks whether there is any composite number n such that Euler's totient function φ(n) divides n − 1. This is true of every prime number, and Lehmer conjectured in 1932 that there are no composite solutions: he showed that if any such n exists, it must be odd, square-free, and divisible by at least seven primes (i.e. ω(n) ≥ 7). Such a number must also be a Carmichael Number.
Properties

In 1980 Cohen and Hagis proved that n > 1020 and that ω(n) ≥ 14.1
In 1988 Hagis showed that if 3 divides n then n > 101937042 and ω(n) ≥ 298848.2
The number of solutions to the problem less than X is $O\left({X^{1/2}(\log X)^{3/4}}\right)$.3
