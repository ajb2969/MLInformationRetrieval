   Acylcarnitine hydrolase      Acylcarnitine hydrolase   In enzymology , an acylcarnitine hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   O-acylcarnitine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a fatty acid + L-carnitine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are O-acylcarnitine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are fatty acid and L-carnitine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is O-acylcarnitine acylhydrolase . Other names in common use include high activity acylcarnitine hydrolase , HACH , carnitine ester hydrolase , palmitoylcarnitine hydrolase , palmitoyl-L-carnitine hydrolase , long-chain acyl-L-carnitine hydrolase , and palmitoyl carnitine hydrolase .
