   Duffing map      Duffing map   The Duffing map (also called as 'Holmes map') is a discrete-time  dynamical system . It is an example of a dynamical system that exhibits chaotic behavior . The Duffing map takes a point ( x n , y n ) in the plane and maps it to a new point given by       x   n  +  1    =    y  n         subscript  x    n  1     subscript  y  n     x_{n+1}=y_{n}\,           y   n  +  1    =     -   b   x  n     +   a   y  n     -   y  n  3     .       subscript  y    n  1            b   subscript  x  n       a   subscript  y  n      superscript   subscript  y  n   3      y_{n+1}=-bx_{n}+ay_{n}-y_{n}^{3}.\,     The map depends on the two constants  a and b . These are usually set to a = 2.75 and b = 0.2 to produce chaotic behaviour. It is a discrete version of the Duffing equation .
