   Closure with a twist      Closure with a twist   Closure with a twist is a property of subsets of an algebraic structure . A subset   Y   Y   Y   of an algebraic structure   X   X   X   is said to exhibit closure with a twist if for every two elements        y  1   ,   y  2    ∈  Y        subscript  y  1    subscript  y  2    Y    y_{1},y_{2}\in Y     there exists an automorphism    ϕ   ϕ   \phi   of   X   X   X   and an element      y  3   ∈  Y       subscript  y  3   Y    y_{3}\in Y   such that        y  1   ⋅   y  2    =   ϕ   (   y  3   )         normal-⋅   subscript  y  1    subscript  y  2      ϕ   subscript  y  3      y_{1}\cdot y_{2}=\phi(y_{3})     where "   ⋅   normal-⋅   \cdot   " is notation for an operation on   X   X   X   preserved by   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   .  Two examples of algebraic structures with the property of closure with a twist are the cwatset and the GC-set .  Cwatset  In mathematics, a cwatset is a set of bitstrings , all of the same length, which is c losed w ith a  t wist.  If each string in a cwatset, C , say, is of length n , then C will be a subset of Z 2 n . Thus, two strings in C are added by adding the bits in the strings modulo 2 (that is, addition without carry, or exclusive disjunction ). The symmetric group on n letters, Sym( n ), acts on Z 2 n by bit permutation:    p (( c 1 ,..., c n ))=( c p (1) ,..., c p (n) ),     where c =( c 1 ,..., c n ) is an element of Z 2 n and p is an element of Sym( n ). Closure with a twist now means that for each element c in C , there exists some permutation  p c such that, when you add c to an arbitrary element e in the cwatset and then apply the permutation, the result will also be an element of C . That is, denoting addition without carry by +, C will be a cwatset if and only if           ∀  c   ∈  C   :    ∃   p  c    ∈   Sym   (  n  )     :    ∀  e   ∈  C   :     p  c    (   e  +  c   )    ∈  C    .       normal-:     for-all  c   C        subscript  p  c      Sym  n      normal-:       for-all  e   C     normal-:         subscript  p  c     e  c    C      \ \forall c\in C:\exists p_{c}\in\text{Sym}(n):\forall e\in C:p_{c}(e+c)\in C.        This condition can also be written as           ∀  c   ∈  C   :    ∃   p  c    ∈   Sym   (  n  )     :     p  c    (   C  +  c   )    =  C    .       normal-:     for-all  c   C        subscript  p  c      Sym  n      normal-:         subscript  p  c     C  c    C      \ \forall c\in C:\exists p_{c}\in\text{Sym}(n):p_{c}(C+c)=C.        Examples   All subgroups of Z 2 n — that is, nonempty subsets of Z 2 n which are closed under addition-without-carry — are trivially cwatsets, since we can choose each permutation p c to be the identity permutation.    An example of a cwatset which is not a group is    F = {000,110,101}.   To demonstrate that F is a cwatset, observe that   F + 000 = F .  F + 110 = {110,000,011}, which is F with the first two bits of each string transposed.  F + 101 = {101,011,000}, which is the same as F after exchanging the first and third bits in each string.    A matrix representation of a cwatset is formed by writing its words as the rows of a 0-1 matrix. For instance a matrix representation of F is given by     F = \begin{bmatrix}     0 & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 1 & 0 \\  1 & 0 & 1  \end{bmatrix}.  To see that F is a cwatset using this notation, note that    F + 000 = \begin{bmatrix}     0 & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 1 & 0 \\  1 & 0 & 1  \end{bmatrix} = F^{id}=F^{(2,3)_R(2,3)_C}.    F + 110 = \begin{bmatrix}     1 & 1 & 0 \\  0 & 0 & 0 \\  0 & 1 & 1  \end{bmatrix} = F^{(1,2)_R(1,2)_C}=F^{(1,2,3)_R(1,2,3)_C}.    F + 101 = \begin{bmatrix}     1 & 0 & 1 \\  0 & 1 & 1 \\  0 & 0 & 0  \end{bmatrix} = F^{(1,3)_R(1,3)_C}=F^{(1,3,2)_R(1,3,2)_C}.  where    π  R     subscript  π  R    \pi_{R}   and    σ  C     subscript  σ  C    \sigma_{C}   denote permutations of the rows and columns of the matrix, respectively, expressed in cycle notation .   For any    n  ≥  3      n  3    n\geq 3   another example of a cwatset is    K  n     subscript  K  n    K_{n}   , which has   n   n   n   -by-   n   n   n   matrix representation     K_n = \begin{bmatrix}     0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\  & & & \vdots & & \\  1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 & 0 \\  1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 1  \end{bmatrix}.  Note that for    n  =  3      n  3    n=3   ,     K  3   =  F       subscript  K  3   F    K_{3}=F   .   An example of a nongroup cwatset with a rectangular matrix representation is     W = \begin{bmatrix}     0 & 0 & 0\\  1 & 0 & 0\\ 1 & 1 & 0\\ 1 & 1 & 1\\ 0 & 1 & 1\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.  Properties  Let C    ⊂     \subset    Z 2 n be a cwatset.   The degree of C is equal to the exponent n .    The order of C , denoted by | C |, is the set cardinality of C .    There is a necessary condition on the order of a cwatset in terms of its degree, which is   analogous to Lagrange's Theorem in group theory. To wit,  Theorem . If C is a cwatset of degree n and order m , then m divides 2 n n !  The divisibility condition is necessary but not sufficient. For example there does not exist a cwatset of degree 5 and order 15.  Generalized cwatset  In mathematics , a generalized cwatset ( GC-set ) is an algebraic structure generalizing the notion of closure with a twist, the defining characteristic of the cwatset.  Definitions  A subset  H of a group  G is a GC-set if for each h ∈ H , there exists a    ϕ  h     subscript  ϕ  h    \phi_{h}   ∈ Aut(G) such that    ϕ  h     subscript  ϕ  h    \phi_{h}    (h)    ⋅   normal-⋅   \cdot    H =    ϕ  h     subscript  ϕ  h    \phi_{h}    (H) .  Furthermore, a GC-set H ⊆ G is a cyclic GC-set if there exists an h ∈ H and a   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   ∈ Aut(G) such that H = {      h  1   ,   h  2   ,  …      subscript  h  1    subscript  h  2   normal-…    h_{1},h_{2},...    } where    h  1     subscript  h  1    h_{1}    = h and    h  n     subscript  h  n    h_{n}    =     h  1     subscript  h  1    h_{1}      ⋅   normal-⋅   \cdot      ϕ   ϕ   \phi    (     h   n  -  1      subscript  h    n  1     h_{n-1}    ) for all n > 1 .  Examples   Any cwatset is a GC-set since ''C + c =    π   π   \pi    (C)'' implies that    π   -  1      superscript  π    1     \pi^{-1}   ''(c) + C =     π   -  1      superscript  π    1     \pi^{-1}    (C)''.  Any group is a GC-set, satisfying the definition with the identity automorphism.  A non-trivial example of a GC-set is H = {0, 2} where G =    Z  10     subscript  Z  10    Z_{10}   .  A nonexample showing that the definition is not trivial for subsets of    Z  2  n     superscript   subscript  Z  2   n    Z_{2}^{n}   is H = {000, 100, 010, 001, 110}.   Properties   A GC-set H ⊆ G always contains the identity element of G .  The direct product of GC-sets is again a GC-set.  A subset  H ⊆ G is a GC-set if and only if it is the projection of a subgroup of Aut(G) ⋉ G , the semi-direct product of Aut(G) and G .  As a consequence of the previous property, GC-sets have an analogue of Lagrange's Theorem : The order of a GC-set divides the order of Aut(G) ⋉ G .  If a GC-set H has the same order as the subgroup of Aut(G) ⋉ G of which it is the projection then for each prime power    p  q     superscript  p  q    p^{q}   which divides the order of H , H contains sub-GC-sets of orders p ,    p  2     superscript  p  2    p^{2}   ,...,    p  q     superscript  p  q    p^{q}   . (Analogue of the first Sylow Theorem )  A GC-set is cyclic if and only if it is the projection of a cyclic subgroup of Aut(G) ⋉ G .   References    .
