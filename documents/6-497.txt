Closure with a twist

Closure with a twist is a property of subsets of an algebraic structure. A subset 
 
 
 
  of an algebraic structure 
 
 
 
  is said to exhibit closure with a twist if for every two elements



there exists an automorphism

 
  of 
 
 
 
  and an element

 
  such that



where "
 
 
 
 " is notation for an operation on 
 
 
 
  preserved by 
 
 
 
 .
Two examples of algebraic structures with the property of closure with a twist are the cwatset and the GC-set.
Cwatset
In mathematics, a cwatset is a set of bitstrings, all of the same length, which is closed with a twist.
If each string in a cwatset, C, say, is of length n, then C will be a subset of Z2n. Thus, two strings in C are added by adding the bits in the strings modulo 2 (that is, addition without carry, or exclusive disjunction). The symmetric group on n letters, Sym(n), acts on Z2n by bit permutation:


p((c1,...,cn))=(cp(1),...,cp(n)),
 



where c=(c1,...,cn) is an element of Z2n and p is an element of Sym(n). Closure with a twist now means that for each element c in C, there exists some permutation pc such that, when you add c to an arbitrary element e in the cwatset and then apply the permutation, the result will also be an element of C. That is, denoting addition without carry by +, C will be a cwatset if and only if








This condition can also be written as








Examples

All subgroups of Z2n — that is, nonempty subsets of Z2n which are closed under addition-without-carry — are trivially cwatsets, since we can choose each permutation pc to be the identity permutation.


An example of a cwatset which is not a group is


F = {000,110,101}.
 

To demonstrate that F is a cwatset, observe that

F + 000 = F.
 
F + 110 = {110,000,011}, which is F with the first two bits of each string transposed.
 
F + 101 = {101,011,000}, which is the same as F after exchanging the first and third bits in each string.
 


A matrix representation of a cwatset is formed by writing its words as the rows of a 0-1 matrix. For instance a matrix representation of F is given by







0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}.
To see that F is a cwatset using this notation, note that






0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} = F^{id}=F^{(2,3)_R(2,3)_C}. 






1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix} = F^{(1,2)_R(1,2)_C}=F^{(1,2,3)_R(1,2,3)_C}. 






1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix} = F^{(1,3)_R(1,3)_C}=F^{(1,3,2)_R(1,3,2)_C}.
where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  denote permutations of the rows and columns of the matrix, respectively, expressed in cycle notation.

For any 
 
 
 
  another example of a cwatset is 
 
 
 
 , which has 
 
 
 
 -by-
 
 
 
  matrix representation







0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
& & & \vdots & & \\
1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}. 
Note that for

An example of a nongroup cwatset with a rectangular matrix representation is







0 & 0 & 0\\
1 & 0 & 0\\ 1 & 1 & 0\\ 1 & 1 & 1\\ 0 & 1 & 1\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}. 
Properties
Let C

Z2n be a cwatset.

The degree of C is equal to the exponent n.


The order of C, denoted by |C|, is the set cardinality of C.


There is a necessary condition on the order of a cwatset in terms of its degree, which is

analogous to Lagrange's Theorem in group theory. To wit,
Theorem. If C is a cwatset of degree n and order m, then m divides 2nn!
The divisibility condition is necessary but not sufficient. For example there does not exist a cwatset of degree 5 and order 15.
Generalized cwatset
In mathematics, a generalized cwatset (GC-set) is an algebraic structure generalizing the notion of closure with a twist, the defining characteristic of the cwatset.
Definitions
A subset H of a group G is a GC-set if for each h ∈ H, there exists a 
 
 
 
  ∈ Aut(G) such that 
 
 
(h)

H = 
 
 
(H).
Furthermore, a GC-set H ⊆ G is a cyclic GC-set if there exists an h ∈ H and a 
 
 
 
  ∈ Aut(G) such that H = {

} where 
 
 
= h and 
 
 
=



(

) for all n > 1.
Examples

Any cwatset is a GC-set since ''C + c = 

(C)'' implies that 
 
 
 
 ''(c) + C = 

(C)''.
Any group is a GC-set, satisfying the definition with the identity automorphism.
A non-trivial example of a GC-set is H = {0, 2} where G = 
 
 
 
 .
A nonexample showing that the definition is not trivial for subsets of 
 
 
 
  is H = {000, 100, 010, 001, 110}.

Properties

A GC-set H ⊆ G always contains the identity element of G.
The direct product of GC-sets is again a GC-set.
A subset H ⊆ G is a GC-set if and only if it is the projection of a subgroup of Aut(G)⋉G, the semi-direct product of Aut(G) and G.
As a consequence of the previous property, GC-sets have an analogue of Lagrange's Theorem: The order of a GC-set divides the order of Aut(G)⋉G.
If a GC-set H has the same order as the subgroup of Aut(G)⋉G of which it is the projection then for each prime power 
 
 
 
  which divides the order of H, H contains sub-GC-sets of orders p,
 
 
 
 ,...,
 
 
 
 . (Analogue of the first Sylow Theorem)
A GC-set is cyclic if and only if it is the projection of a cyclic subgroup of Aut(G)⋉G.
