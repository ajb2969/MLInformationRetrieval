Sugar-phosphatase




Sugar-phosphatase

In enzymology, a sugar-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

sugar phosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  sugar + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are sugar phosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are sugar and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sugar-phosphate phosphohydrolase.
