   Diacylglycerol kinase (CTP dependent)      Diacylglycerol kinase (CTP dependent)   Diacylglycerol kinase (CTP dependent) (, DAG kinase , CTP-dependent diacylglycerol kinase , diglyceride kinase ) is an enzyme with system name CTP:1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphotransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   CTP + 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CDP + 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate   This enzyme requires Ca 2+ or Mg 2+ for activity.
