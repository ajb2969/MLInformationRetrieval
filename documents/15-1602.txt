Diacylglycerol kinase (CTP dependent)

Diacylglycerol kinase (CTP dependent) (, DAG kinase, CTP-dependent diacylglycerol kinase, diglyceride kinase) is an enzyme with system name CTP:1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphotransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

CTP + 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol 
 
 
 
  CDP + 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate
