Mycophenolic acid acyl-glucuronide esterase

Mycophenolic acid acyl-glucuronide esterase (, mycophenolic acid acyl-glucuronide deglucuronidase, AcMPAG deglucuronidase) is an enzyme with system name mycophenolic acid O-acyl-glucuronide-ester hydrolase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

mycophenolic acid O-acyl-glucuronide + H2O 
 
 
mycophenolate + D-glucuronate


This liver enzyme deglucuronidates mycophenolic acid O-acyl-glucuronide.
