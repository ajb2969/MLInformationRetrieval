   Stable vector bundle      Stable vector bundle   In mathematics, a stable vector bundle is a vector bundle that is stable in the sense of geometric invariant theory . They were defined by .  Stable vector bundles over curves  A bundle W over an algebraic curve (or over a Riemann surface ) is stable if and only if  $$\displaystyle\frac{\deg(V)}{\hbox{rank}(V)} < \frac{\deg(W)}{\hbox{rank}(W)}$$  for all proper non-zero subbundles V of W and is semistable if  $$\displaystyle\frac{\deg(V)}{\hbox{rank}(V)} \le \frac{\deg(W)}{\hbox{rank}(W)}$$  for all proper non-zero subbundles V of W . Informally this says that a bundle is stable if it is "more ample " than any proper subbundle, and is unstable if it contains a "more ample" subbundle. The moduli space of stable bundles of given rank and degree is an algebraic variety .  showed that stable bundles on projective nonsingular curves are the same as those that have projectively flat unitary irreducible connections; these correspond to irreducible unitary representations of the fundamental group. Kobayashi and Hitchin conjectured an analogue of this in higher dimensions; this was proved for projective nonsingular surfaces by , who showed that in this case a vector bundle is stable if and only if it has an irreducible Hermitianâ€“Einstein connection .  The cohomology of the moduli space of stable vector bundles over a curve was described by  and .  Stable vector bundles over projective varieties  If X is a smooth projective variety of dimension n and H is a hyperplane section, then a vector bundle (or torsionfree sheaf) W is called stable if  $$\frac{\chi(V(nH))}{\hbox{rank}(V)} < \frac{\chi(W(nH))}{\hbox{rank}(W)}\text{ for }n\text{ large}$$  for all proper non-zero subbundles (or subsheaves) V of W , where $\chi$ denotes the Euler characteristic of an algebraic vector bundle and the vector bundle $V(nH)$ means the n -th twist of V by H . W is called semistable if the above holds with
