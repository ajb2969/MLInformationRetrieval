Jordan's totient function

Let k be a positive integer. In number theory, Jordan's totient function

 
  of a positive integer n is the number of k-tuples of positive integers all less than or equal to n that form a coprime (k + 1)-tuple together with n. This is a generalisation of Euler's totient function, which is J1. The function is named after Camille Jordan.
Definition
Jordan's totient function is multiplicative and may be evaluated as



Properties





which may be written in the language of Dirichlet convolutions as1


 
  and via Möbius inversion as


 
 . Since the Dirichlet generating function of μ is 1/ζ(s) and the Dirichlet generating function of nk is ζ(s-k), the series for Jk becomes


 
 .

An average order of Jk(n) is



 
 .

The Dedekind psi function is



 
 , and by inspection of the definition (recognizing that each factor in the product over the primes is a cyclotomic polynomial of p-k), the arithmetic functions defined by 
 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  can also be shown to be integer-valued multiplicative functions.



\sum_{\delta\mid n}\delta^sJ_r(\delta)J_s\left(\frac{n}{\delta}\right) = J_{r+s}(n) .      2
Order of matrix groups
The general linear group of matrices of order m over Zn has order3



The special linear group of matrices of order m over Zn has order

The first two formulas were discovered by Jordan.
Examples
Explicit lists in the OEIS are J2 in , J3 in , J4 in , J5 in , J6 up to J10 in  up to .
Multiplicative functions defined by ratios are J2(n)/J1(n) in , J3(n)/J1(n) in , J4(n)/J1(n) in , J5(n)/J1(n) in , J6(n)/J1(n) in , J7(n)/J1(n) in , J8(n)/J1(n) in , J9(n)/J1(n) in , J10(n)/J1(n) in , J11(n)/J1(n) in .
Examples of the ratios J2k(n)/Jk(n) are J4(n)/J2(n) in , J6(n)/J3(n) in , and J8(n)/J4(n) in .
