Chung–Fuchs theorem

In mathematics, the Chung–Fuchs theorem, named after Wolfgang Heinrich Johannes Fuchs and Chung Kai-lai, states that for a particle undergoing a random walk in m-dimensions, it is certain to come back infinitely often to any neighborhood of the origin on a one-dimensional line (m = 1) or two-dimensional plane (m = 2), but in three or more dimensional spaces it will leave to infinity.
Specifically, if a position of the particle is described by the vector

where 
 
 
 
  are independent m-dimensional vectors with a given multivariate distribution,
then if

the following holds:
