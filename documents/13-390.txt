Gennadi Sardanashvily (; born March 13, 1950) is a theoretical physicist, a principal research scientist of Moscow State University.
Biography
Gennadi Sardanashvily graduated from Moscow State University (MSU) in 1973, he was a Ph.D. student of the Department of Theoretical Physics (MSU) in 1973–76, where he held a position in 1976.
He attained his Ph.D. degree in physics and mathematics from MSU, in 1980, with Dmitri Ivanenko as his supervisor, and his D.Sc. degree in physics and mathematics from MSU, in 1998.
Gennadi Sardanashvily is the founder and Managing Editor (2003 - 2013) of the International Journal of Geometric Methods in Modern Physics (IJGMMP).
Research area
Gennadi Sardanashvily research area is geometric methods in classical and quantum mechanics and field theory, gravitation theory. His main achievement is geometric formulation of classical field theory and non-autonomous mechanics including:

gauge gravitation theory, where gravity is treated as a classical Higgs field associated to a reduced Lorentz structure on a world manifold1


geometric formulation of classical field theory2 and Lagrangian BRST theory3 where classical fields are represented by sections of fiber bundles and their dynamics is described in terms of jet manifolds and the variational bicomplex (covariant classical field theory)


covariant (polysymplectic) Hamiltonian field theory, where momenta correspond to derivatives of fields with respect to all world coordinates4


the second Noether theorem in a very general setting of reducible degenerate Grassmann-graded Lagrangian systems on an arbitrary manifold5
geometric formulation of classical6 and quantum7 non-autonomous mechanics on fiber bundles over 
 
 



generalization of the Liouville–Arnold, Nekhoroshev and Mishchenko–Fomenko theorems on completely and partially integrable and superintegrable Hamiltonian systems to the case of non-compact invariant submanifolds8


cohomology of the variational bicomplex of graded differential forms of finite jet order on an infinite order jet manifold.9

Gennadi Sardanashvily has published more than 300 scientific works, including 24 books.
