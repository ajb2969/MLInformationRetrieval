   NADPH—hemoprotein reductase      NADPH—hemoprotein reductase   In enzymology , a NADPH—hemoprotein reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   NADPH + H + + n oxidized hemoprotein   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   NADP + + n reduced hemoprotein   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are NADPH , H + , and oxidized hemoprotein , whereas its two products are NADP + and reduced hemoprotein .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on NADH or NADPH with a heme protein as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is NADPH:hemoprotein oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include CPR , FAD-cytochrome c reductase , NADP---cytochrome c reductase , NADP---cytochrome reductase , NADPH-dependent cytochrome c reductase , NADPH:P-450 reductase , NADPH:ferrihemoprotein oxidoreductase , NADPH---cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase , NADPH---cytochrome c oxidoreductase , NADPH---cytochrome c reductase , NADPH---cytochrome p-450 reductase , NADPH---ferricytochrome c oxidoreductase , NADPH---ferrihemoprotein reductase , TPNH2 cytochrome c reductase , TPNH-cytochrome c reductase , aldehyde reductase (NADPH-dependent) , cytochrome P-450 reductase , cytochrome c reductase (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide , phosphate, NADPH, NADPH-dependent) , dihydroxynicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-cytochrome c , reductase , ferrihemoprotein P-450 reductase , reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-cytochrome c , reductase , reductase, cytochrome c (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide , and phosphate) . It has 2 cofactors : FAD , and FMN .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 10 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , and .
