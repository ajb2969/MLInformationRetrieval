Spline interpolation

In the mathematical field of numerical analysis, spline interpolation is a form of interpolation where the interpolant is a special type of piecewise polynomial called a spline. Spline interpolation is often preferred over polynomial interpolation because the interpolation error can be made small even when using low degree polynomials for the spline. Spline interpolation avoids the problem of Runge's phenomenon, in which oscillation can occur between points when interpolating using high degree polynomials.
Introduction
Originally, spline was a term for elastic rulers that were bent to pass through a number of predefined points ("knots"). These were used to make technical drawings for shipbuilding and construction by hand, as illustrated by Figure 1. thumb|upright=1.8|right|Figure 1: Interpolation with cubic splines between eight points. Hand-drawn technical drawings were made for shipbuilding etc. using flexible rulers that were bent to follow pre-defined points
The approach to mathematically model the shape of such elastic rulers fixed by 
 
 
 
  knots 
 
 
 
  is to interpolate between all the pairs of knots 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  with polynomials 
 
 
 
 .
The curvature of a curve 
 
 
 
  is given by:



As the spline will take a shape that minimizes the bending (under the constraint of passing through all knots) both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  will be continuous everywhere and at the knots. To achieve this one must have that



This can only be achieved if polynomials of degree 3 or higher are used. The classical approach is to use polynomials of degree 3 — the case of cubic splines.

If the sequence  is such that in addition  q′′i+1(xi)}} holds for i = 1, ..., n-1. Then the resulting function will even have a continuous second derivative.
From (), (), () and () follows that this is the case if and only if
{x_i-x_{i-1}} + \left(\frac {1}{x_i-x_{i-1}}+ \frac {1}\right) 2k_i+ \frac {k_{i+1}} =
  3 \left(\frac {y_i - y_{i-1}}{{(x_i-x_{i-1})}^2}+\frac {y_{i+1} - y_i}{{(x_{i+1}-x_i)}^2}\right)|15}}
for i = 1, ..., n-1. The relations () are 
 
 
 
  linear equations for the 
 
 
 
  values .
For the elastic rulers being the model for the spline interpolation one has that to the left of the left-most "knot" and to the right of the right-most "knot" the ruler can move freely and will therefore take the form of a straight line with

  one gets that for "Natural Splines" one in addition to the 
 
 
 
  linear equations () should have that





 
  i.e. that  k_{n-1} +\frac{2}{x_n-x_{n-1}}k_n = 3 \frac{y_n-y_{n-1}}{(x_n-x_{n-1})^2}.|17}}
Eventually, () together with () and () constitute 
 
 
 
  linear equations that uniquely define the 
 
 
 
 
  parameters .
There exists other end conditions: "Clamped spline", that specifies the slope at the ends of the spline, and the popular "not-a-knot spline", that requires that the third derivative is also continuous at the  and  points. For the "not-a-knot" spline, the additional equations will read:
