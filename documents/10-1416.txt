   Quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase      Quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase   In enzymology , a quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   quercetin + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-(3,4-dihydroxybenzoyloxy)-4,6-dihydroxybenzoate + CO + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are quercetin and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are 2-(3,4-dihydroxybenzoyloxy)-4,6-dihydroxybenzoate , CO , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 . The systematic name of this enzyme class is quercetin:oxygen 2,3-oxidoreductase (decyclizing) . Other names in common use include quercetinase , and flavonol 2,4-oxygenase . It has 2 cofactors : iron , and Copper .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 6 crystal structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , and .
