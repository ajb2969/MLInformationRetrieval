List of integrals of trigonometric functions

The following is a list of integrals (antiderivative functions) of trigonometric functions. For antiderivatives involving both exponential and trigonometric functions, see List of integrals of exponential functions. For a complete list of antiderivative functions, see Lists of integrals. For the special antiderivatives involving trigonometric functions, see Trigonometric integral.
Generally, if the function 
 
 
 
  is any trigonometric function, and 
 
 
 
  is its derivative,



In all formulas the constant a is assumed to be nonzero, and C denotes the constant of integration.
