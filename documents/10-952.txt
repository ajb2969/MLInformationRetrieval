   Progesterone 5alpha-reductase      Progesterone 5alpha-reductase   In enzymology , a progesterone 5alpha-reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5alpha-pregnan-3,20-dione + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   progesterone + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5alpha-pregnan-3,20-dione and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are progesterone , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5alpha-pregnan-3,20-dione:NADP+ 5-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include steroid 5-alpha-reductase , and Delta4-steroid 5alpha-reductase (progesterone) . This enzyme participates in c21-steroid hormone metabolism .
