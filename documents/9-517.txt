   Fujiki class C      Fujiki class C   In algebraic geometry , a complex manifold is called Fujiki class C if it is bimeromorphic to a compact Kähler manifold . This notion was defined by Akira Fujiki . 1  Properties  Let M be a compact manifold of Fujiki class C, and    X  ⊂  M      X  M    X\subset M   its complex subvariety. Then X is also in Fujiki class C (, 2 Lemma 4.6). Moreover, the Douady space of X (that is, the moduli of deformations of a subvariety    X  ⊂  M      X  M    X\subset M   , M fixed) is compact and in Fujiki class C. 3  Conjectures  J.-P. Demailly and M. Paun have shown that a manifold is in Fujiki class C if and only if it supports a Kähler current . 4 They also conjectured that a manifold M is in Fujiki class C if it admits a nef current which is big , that is, satisfies        ∫  M    ω   d  i   m  ℂ   M     >  0.        subscript   M    superscript  ω    d  i   subscript  m  ℂ   M     0.    \int_{M}\omega^{{dim_{\mathbb{C}}M}}>0.     For a cohomology class     [  ω  ]   ∈    H  2    (  M  )         delimited-[]  ω      superscript  H  2   M     [\omega]\in H^{2}(M)   which is rational, this statement is known: by Grauert-Riemenschneider conjecture , a holomorphic line bundle L with first Chern class        c  1    (  L  )    =   [  ω  ]          subscript  c  1   L    delimited-[]  ω     c_{1}(L)=[\omega]     nef and big has maximal Kodaira dimension , hence the corresponding rational map to      ℙ   H  0    (   L  N   )       ℙ   superscript  H  0    superscript  L  N     {\mathbb{P}}H^{0}(L^{N})     is generically finite onto its image, which is algebraic, and therefore Kähler.  Fujiki 5 and Ueno 6 asked whether the property C is stable under deformations. This conjecture was disproven in 1992 by Y.-S.
