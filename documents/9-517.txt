Fujiki class C

In algebraic geometry, a complex manifold is called Fujiki class C if it is bimeromorphic to a compact Kähler manifold. This notion was defined by Akira Fujiki.1
Properties
Let M be a compact manifold of Fujiki class C, and 
 
 
 
  its complex subvariety. Then X is also in Fujiki class C (,2 Lemma 4.6). Moreover, the Douady space of X (that is, the moduli of deformations of a subvariety 
 
 
 
 , M fixed) is compact and in Fujiki class C.3
Conjectures
J.-P. Demailly and M. Paun have shown that a manifold is in Fujiki class C if and only if it supports a Kähler current.4 They also conjectured that a manifold M is in Fujiki class C if it admits a nef current which is big, that is, satisfies



For a cohomology class 
 
 
 
  which is rational, this statement is known: by Grauert-Riemenschneider conjecture, a holomorphic line bundle L with first Chern class



nef and big has maximal Kodaira dimension, hence the corresponding rational map to



is generically finite onto its image, which is algebraic, and therefore Kähler.
Fujiki5 and Ueno6 asked whether the property C is stable under deformations. This conjecture was disproven in 1992 by Y.-S. Poon and Claude LeBrun7
