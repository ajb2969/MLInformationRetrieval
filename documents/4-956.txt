   Friedrichs extension      Friedrichs extension   In functional analysis , the Friedrichs extension is a canonical  self-adjoint extension of a non-negative densely defined symmetric operator . It is named after the mathematician Kurt Friedrichs . This extension is particularly useful in situations where an operator may fail to be essentially self-adjoint or whose essential self-adjointness is difficult to show.  An operator T is non-negative if        ⟨  ξ  ∣   T  ξ   ⟩   ≥  0    ξ  ∈   dom  T       formulae-sequence     inner-product  ξ    T  ξ    0     ξ   dom  T      \langle\xi\mid T\xi\rangle\geq 0\quad\xi\in\operatorname{dom}\ T     Examples  Example . Multiplication by a non-negative function on an L 2 space is a non-negative self-adjoint operator.  Example . Let U be an open set in R n . On L 2 ( U ) we consider differential operators of the form          [   T  ϕ   ]    (  x  )    =   -    ∑   i  ,  j      ∂   x  i     {    a   i  j     (  x  )     ∂   x  j    ϕ    (  x  )    }         x  ∈  U   ,   ϕ  ∈    C  0  ∞    (  U  )       ,     formulae-sequence       delimited-[]    T  ϕ    x       subscript    i  j      subscript    subscript  x  i       subscript  a    i  j    x    subscript    subscript  x  j    ϕ   x        formulae-sequence    x  U     ϕ    superscript   subscript  normal-C  0     U       [T\phi](x)=-\sum_{i,j}\partial_{x_{i}}\{a_{ij}(x)\partial_{x_{j}}\phi(x)\}%
 \quad x\in U,\phi\in\operatorname{C}_{0}^{\infty}(U),     where the functions a i j are infinitely differentiable real-valued functions on U . We consider T acting on the dense subspace of infinitely differentiable complex-valued functions of compact support, in symbols         C  0  ∞    (  U  )    ⊆    L  2    (  U  )     .        superscript   subscript  normal-C  0     U      superscript  L  2   U     \operatorname{C}_{0}^{\infty}(U)\subseteq L^{2}(U).     If for each x ∈ U the n × n matrix      [       a  11    (  x  )        a  12    (  x  )      ⋯      a   1  n     (  x  )          a  21    (  x  )        a  22    (  x  )      ⋯      a   2  n     (  x  )        ⋮    ⋮    ⋱    ⋮        a   n  1     (  x  )        a   n  2     (  x  )      ⋯      a   n  n     (  x  )       ]         subscript  a  11   x      subscript  a  12   x   normal-⋯     subscript  a    1  n    x        subscript  a  21   x      subscript  a  22   x   normal-⋯     subscript  a    2  n    x     normal-⋮  normal-⋮  normal-⋱  normal-⋮       subscript  a    n  1    x      subscript  a    n  2    x   normal-⋯     subscript  a    n  n    x      \begin{bmatrix}a_{11}(x)&a_{12}(x)&\cdots&a_{1n}(x)\\
 a_{21}(x)&a_{22}(x)&\cdots&a_{2n}(x)\\
 \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
 a_{n1}(x)&a_{n2}(x)&\cdots&a_{nn}(x)\end{bmatrix}     is non-negative semi-definite, then T is a non-negative operator. This means (a) that the matrix is hermitian and        ∑   i  ,  j      a   i  j     (  x  )    c  i     c  j   ¯     ≥  0        subscript    i  j       subscript  a    i  j    x   subscript  c  i    normal-¯   subscript  c  j      0    \sum_{i,j}a_{ij}(x)c_{i}\overline{c_{j}}\geq 0     for every choice of complex numbers c 1 , ..., c n . This is proved using integration by parts .  These operators are elliptic although in general elliptic operators may not be non-negative. They are however bounded from below.  Definition of Friedrichs extension  The definition of the Friedrichs extension is based on the theory of closed positive forms on Hilbert spaces. If T is non-negative, then       Q   (  ξ  ,  η  )    =    ⟨  ξ  ∣   T  η   ⟩   +   ⟨  ξ  ∣  η  ⟩         normal-Q  ξ  η      inner-product  ξ    T  η     inner-product  ξ  η      \operatorname{Q}(\xi,\eta)=\langle\xi\mid T\eta\rangle+\langle\xi\mid\eta\rangle     is a sesquilinear form on dom T and        Q   (  ξ  ,  ξ  )    =    ⟨  ξ  ∣   T  ξ   ⟩   +   ⟨  ξ  ∣  ξ  ⟩    ≥    ∥  ξ  ∥   2    .         normal-Q  ξ  ξ      inner-product  ξ    T  ξ     inner-product  ξ  ξ          superscript   norm  ξ   2      \operatorname{Q}(\xi,\xi)=\langle\xi\mid T\xi\rangle+\langle\xi\mid\xi\rangle%
 \geq\|\xi\|^{2}.     Thus Q defines an inner product on dom T . Let H 1 be the completion of dom T with respect to Q. H 1 is an abstractly defined space; for instance its elements can be represented as equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences of elements of dom T . It is not obvious that all elements in H 1 can identified with elements of H . However, the following can be proved:  The canonical inclusion       dom  T   →  H     normal-→   dom  T   H    \operatorname{dom}\ T\rightarrow H     extends to an injective continuous map H 1 → H . We regard H 1 as a subspace of H .  Define an operator A by       dom  A   =   {   ξ  ∈   H  1    :    ϕ  ξ   :   η  ↦    Q   (  ξ  ,  η  )    is bounded linear.     }        dom  A    conditional-set    ξ   subscript  H  1     normal-:   subscript  ϕ  ξ    maps-to  η     normal-Q  ξ  η   is bounded linear.        \operatorname{dom}\ A=\{\xi\in H_{1}:\phi_{\xi}:\eta\mapsto\operatorname{Q}(%
 \xi,\eta)\mbox{ is bounded linear.}\}     In the above formula, bounded is relative to the topology on H 1 inherited from H . By the Riesz representation theorem applied to the linear functional φ ξ extended to H , there is a unique A ξ ∈ H such that        Q   (  ξ  ,  η  )    =   ⟨   A  ξ   ∣  η  ⟩     η  ∈   H  1       formulae-sequence     normal-Q  ξ  η    inner-product    A  ξ   η      η   subscript  H  1      \operatorname{Q}(\xi,\eta)=\langle A\xi\mid\eta\rangle\quad\eta\in H_{1}     Theorem . A is a non-negative self-adjoint operator such that T 1 = A - I extends T .  T 1 is the Friedrichs extension of T .  Krein's theorem on non-negative self-adjoint extensions  M. G. Krein has given an elegant characterization of all non-negative self-adjoint extensions of a non-negative symmetric operator T .  If T , S are non-negative self-adjoint operators, write      T  ≤  S      T  S    T\leq S     if, and only if,        dom   (   S   1  /  2    )    ⊆   dom   (   T   1  /  2    )         dom   superscript  S    1  2      dom   superscript  T    1  2       \operatorname{dom}(S^{1/2})\subseteq\operatorname{dom}(T^{1/2})             ⟨    T   1  /  2    ξ   ∣    T   1  /  2    ξ   ⟩   ≤   ⟨    S   1  /  2    ξ   ∣    S   1  /  2    ξ   ⟩      ∀  ξ   ∈   dom   (   S   1  /  2    )        formulae-sequence     inner-product     superscript  T    1  2    ξ      superscript  T    1  2    ξ     inner-product     superscript  S    1  2    ξ      superscript  S    1  2    ξ        for-all  ξ    dom   superscript  S    1  2        \langle T^{1/2}\xi\mid T^{1/2}\xi\rangle\leq\langle S^{1/2}\xi\mid S^{1/2}\xi%
 \rangle\quad\forall\xi\in\operatorname{dom}(S^{1/2})      Theorem . There are unique self-adjoint extensions T min and T max of any non-negative symmetric operator T such that        T  min   ≤   T  max    ,       subscript  T  min    subscript  T  max     T_{\mathrm{min}}\leq T_{\mathrm{max}},     and every non-negative self-adjoint extension S of T is between T min and T max , i.e.        T  min   ≤  S  ≤   T  max    .         subscript  T  min   S        subscript  T  max      T_{\mathrm{min}}\leq S\leq T_{\mathrm{max}}.
