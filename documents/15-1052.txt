   Clavaminate synthase      Clavaminate synthase   Clavaminate synthase (, clavaminate synthase 2 , clavaminic acid synthase ) is an enzyme with system name deoxyamidinoproclavaminate,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating) . 1 2 3 4 5 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (1) deoxyamidinoproclavaminate + 2-oxoglutarate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   amidinoproclavaminate + succinate + CO 2   (2) proclavaminate + 2-oxoglutarate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   dihydroclavaminate + succinate + CO 2 + H 2 O  (3) dihydroclavaminate + 2-oxoglutarate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   clavaminate + succinate + CO 2 + H 2 O   Clavaminate synthase contains nonheme iron .
