Clavaminate synthase

Clavaminate synthase (, clavaminate synthase 2, clavaminic acid synthase) is an enzyme with system name deoxyamidinoproclavaminate,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating).12345 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) deoxyamidinoproclavaminate + 2-oxoglutarate + O2

 
  amidinoproclavaminate + succinate + CO2

(2) proclavaminate + 2-oxoglutarate + O2

 
  dihydroclavaminate + succinate + CO2 + H2O
 
(3) dihydroclavaminate + 2-oxoglutarate + O2

 
  clavaminate + succinate + CO2 + H2O
 

Clavaminate synthase contains nonheme iron.
