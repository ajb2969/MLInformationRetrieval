   Proline dehydrogenase      Proline dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a proline dehydrogenase (, formerly ) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-proline + ubiquinone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (S)-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate + ubiquinol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-proline and ubiquinone , whereas its two products are (S)-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate and ubiquinol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with a quinone or similar compounds as acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-proline:quinone oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include L-proline dehydrogenase , and L-proline:(acceptor) oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in arginine and proline metabolism . It employs one cofactor , FAD .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 9 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , and .
