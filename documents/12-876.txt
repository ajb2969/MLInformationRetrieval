   Erdős–Fuchs theorem      Erdős–Fuchs theorem   In mathematics , in the area of combinatorial number theory , the Erdős–Fuchs theorem is a statement about the number of ways that numbers can be represented as a sum of two elements of a given set, stating that the average order of this number cannot be close to being a linear function .  The theorem is named after Paul Erdős and Wolfgang Heinrich Johannes Fuchs .  Statement  Let A be a subset of the natural numbers and r ( n ) denote the number of ways that a natural number n can be expressed as the sum of two elements of A (taking order into account). We consider the average        R   (  n  )    =     r   (  1  )    +   r   (  2  )    +  ⋯  +   r   (  n  )     n    .        R  n         r  1     r  2   normal-⋯    r  n    n     R(n)=\frac{r(1)+r(2)+\cdots+r(n)}{n}.     The theorem states that       R   (  n  )    =   C  +   O   (   n    -   3  /  4    -  ε    )           R  n     C    O   superscript  n        3  4    ε        R(n)=C+O\left(n^{-3/4-\varepsilon}\right)     cannot hold unless C = 0.
