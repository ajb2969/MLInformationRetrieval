   Gaussian rational      Gaussian rational   In mathematics , a Gaussian rational number is a complex number of the form p + qi , where p and q are both rational numbers . The set of all Gaussian rationals forms the Gaussian rational field , denoted Q ( i ), obtained by adjoining the imaginary number  i to the field of rationals. It thus provides an example of an algebraic number field , which is both a quadratic field and a cyclotomic field (since i is a 4th root of unity ). Like all quadratic fields it is a Galois extension of Q with Galois group  cyclic of order two, in this case generated by complex conjugation , and is thus an abelian extension of Q , with conductor 4. 1  As with cyclotomic fields more generally, the field of Gaussian rationals is neither ordered nor complete (as a metric space). The Gaussian integers  Z [ i ] form the ring of integers of Q ( i ).  The concept of Ford circles can be generalized from the rational numbers to the Gaussian rationals, giving Ford spheres. In this construction, the complex numbers are embedded as a plane in a three-dimensional Euclidean space , and for each Gaussian rational point in this plane one constructs a sphere tangent to the plane at that point. For a Gaussian rational represented in lowest terms as    p  /  q      p  q    p/q   , the radius of this sphere should be     1  /  q    q  ¯         1  q    normal-¯  q     1/q\bar{q}   where    q  ¯     normal-¯  q    \bar{q}   represents the complex conjugate of   q   q   q   . The resulting spheres are tangent for pairs of Gaussian rationals    P  /  Q      P  Q    P/Q   and    p  /  q      p  q    p/q   with     |    P  q   -   p  Q    |   =  1            P  q     p  Q     1    |Pq-pQ|=1   , and otherwise they do not intersect each other. 2 3  References  it:Intero di Gauss#Campo dei quozienti "  Category:Cyclotomic fields     Ian Stewart , David O.
