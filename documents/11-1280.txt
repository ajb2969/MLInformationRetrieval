Complex base systems

In arithmetic, a complex base system is a positional numeral system whose radix is an imaginary (proposed by Donald Knuth in 195512) or complex number (proposed by S. Khmelnik in 19643 and Walter F. Penney in 1965456).
In general
Let 
 
 
 
  be an integral domain

 
  and 
 
 
 
  the (Archimedean) absolute value on it.
A number 
 
 
 
 
  in a positional number system is represented as an expansion


 
 , where











is the radix (or base) 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 









is the exponent (position or place) 
 
 









are digits from the finite set of digits 
 
 
 
  usually with 
 
 






The cardinality

 
 
  is called the level of decomposition.
A positional number system or coding system is a pair


 
  with radix 
 
 
 
  and set of digits 
 
 
 
 , and we write the standard set of digits with 
 
 
 
  digits as


 
 .
Desirable are coding systems with the features

Every number in 
 
 
 
 , e. g. the integers 
 
 
 
 , the Gaussian integers

 
  or the integers 
 
 
 
 , is uniquely representable as a finite code, possibly with a sign ±.
Every number in the field of fractions

 
 
 , which possibly is completed for the metric given by 
 
 
 
  yielding 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 , is representable as an infinite series 
 
 
 
  which converges under 
 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 , and the measure of the set of numbers with more than one representation is 0. The latter requires that the set 
 
 
 
  be minimal, i. e. 
 
 
 
  for real resp. 
 
 
 
  for complex numbers.

In the Real Numbers
In this notation our standard decimal coding scheme is denoted by


 
 , the standard binary system is


 
 , the negabinary system is


 
 , and the balanced ternary system7 is


 
 . All these coding systems have the mentioned features for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 , and the latter two do not require a sign.
In the Complex Numbers
Well-known positional number systems for the complex numbers include the following (
 
 
 
  being the imaginary unit):



 
 , e. g. 
 
 
8 and



 
 , 9 the quater-imaginary base, proposed by Donald Knuth in 1955.



 
 
  and



1011 (see also the section Base −1±i below).



 
 , where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  is a positive integer that can take multiple values at a given 
 
 
 
 .12 For 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  this is the system



 
 .



 
 
 ;13




 
 , where the set 
 
 
 
  consists of complex numbers 
 
 
 
 , and numbers 
 
 
 
 , e. g.



 
 .14



 
 , where 

 (-2)^{\tfrac{\nu}2}            & \text{if } \nu \text{ even,}\\
 (-2)^{\tfrac{\nu-1}2}\mathrm i & \text{if } \nu \text{ odd.}
\end{cases} 15
Binary systems
Binary coding systems of complex numbers, i. e. systems with the digits 
 
 
 
 , are of practical interest.16 Listed below are some coding systems 
 
 
 
  (all are special cases of the systems above) and codes for the numbers –1, 2, -2, 
 
 
 
 . The standard binary (which requires a sign) and the negabinary systems are also listed for comparison. They do not have a genuine expansion for 
 
 
 
 
 .

Some Bases and some Representations



As in all positional number systems with an Archimedean absolute value there are some numbers with multiple representations. Examples of such numbers are shown in the right column of the table.
 If the set of digits is minimal, the set of such numbers has a measure of 0. This is the case with all the mentioned coding systems.
Base −1±i
Of particular interest, the quater-imaginary base (base 2i) and base -1±i systems discussed below can be used to finitely represent the Gaussian integers without sign.
  Base −1±i, using digits 0 and 1, was proposed by S. Khmelnik in 196420 and Walter F. Penney in 1965.2122 The rounding region of an integer – i.e., a set of complex (non-integer) numbers that share the integer part of their representation in this system – has a fractal shape, the twindragon.
Example: 3 = 11 base(2); 11 base(-1+i) = i; the position of 3 on the graph (x,y*i) is (0,1).
