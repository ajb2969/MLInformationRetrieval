Racah polynomials

In mathematics, Racah polynomials are orthogonal polynomials named after Giulio Racah, as their orthogonality relations are equivalent to his orthogonality relations for Racah coefficients.
The Racah polynomials were first defined by  and are given by


 
   introduced the q-Racah polynomials defined in terms of basic hypergeometric functions by


 
  They are sometimes given with changes of variables as
