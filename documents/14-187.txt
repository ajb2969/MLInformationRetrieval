   Fabius function      Fabius function     In mathematics, the Fabius function is an example of an infinitely differentiable function that is nowhere analytic , found by .  The Fabius function is defined on the unit interval, and is given by the probability distribution of        ∑   n  =  1   ∞     2   -  n     ξ  n     ,      superscript   subscript     n  1         superscript  2    n     subscript  ξ  n      \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}2^{-n}\xi_{n},     where the ξ n are independent  uniformly distributed  random variables on the unit interval .  This function satisfies the functional equation f ′( x )=2 f (2 x ) (where f ′ denotes the derivative of f ) for 0≤ x ≤1. There is a unique extension of f to the nonnegative real numbers which satisfies the same equation: it can be defined by f ( x +1) = 1− f ( x ) for 0≤ x ≤1 and f ( x +2 r ) = − f ( x ) for 0≤ x ≤2 r with r ≥1 integer; it is strongly related to the Thue–Morse sequence .
