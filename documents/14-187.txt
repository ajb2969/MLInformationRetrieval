Fabius function

 
In mathematics, the Fabius function is an example of an infinitely differentiable function that is nowhere analytic, found by .
The Fabius function is defined on the unit interval, and is given by the probability distribution of



where the ξn are independent uniformly distributed random variables on the unit interval.
This function satisfies the functional equation f′(x)=2f(2x) (where f′ denotes the derivative of f) for 0≤x≤1. There is a unique extension of f to the nonnegative real numbers which satisfies the same equation: it can be defined by f(x+1) = 1−f(x) for 0≤x≤1 and f(x+2r) = −f(x) for 0≤x≤2r with r≥1 integer; it is strongly related to the Thue–Morse sequence.
