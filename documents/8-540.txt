   Cotorsion group      Cotorsion group   In mathematics , in the realm of abelian  group theory , an abelian group is said to be cotorsion if every extension of it by a torsion-free group splits. If the group is   C   C   C   , this is equivalent to asserting that     E  x  t   (  G  ,  C  )    =  0        E  x  t   G  C    0    Ext(G,C)=0   for all torsion-free groups   G   G   G   . It suffices to check the condition for   G   G   G   being the group of rational numbers .  Some properties of cotorsion groups:   Any quotient of a cotorsion group is cotorsion.  A direct product of groups is cotorsion if and only if each factor is.  Every divisible group or injective group is cotorsion.  The Baer Fomin Theorem states that a torsion group is cotorsion if and only if it is a direct sum of a divisible group and a bounded group , that is, a group of bounded exponent.  A torsion-free abelian group is cotorsion if and only if it is algebraically compact .  Ulm subgroups of cotorsion groups are cotorsion and Ulm factors of cotorsion groups are algebraically compact.   External links     "  Category:Abelian group theory  Category:Properties of groups
