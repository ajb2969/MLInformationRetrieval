Cotorsion group

In mathematics, in the realm of abelian group theory, an abelian group is said to be cotorsion if every extension of it by a torsion-free group splits. If the group is 
 
 
 
 , this is equivalent to asserting that 
 
 
 
  for all torsion-free groups 
 
 
 
 . It suffices to check the condition for 
 
 
 
  being the group of rational numbers.
Some properties of cotorsion groups:

Any quotient of a cotorsion group is cotorsion.
A direct product of groups is cotorsion if and only if each factor is.
Every divisible group or injective group is cotorsion.
The Baer Fomin Theorem states that a torsion group is cotorsion if and only if it is a direct sum of a divisible group and a bounded group, that is, a group of bounded exponent.
A torsion-free abelian group is cotorsion if and only if it is algebraically compact.
Ulm subgroups of cotorsion groups are cotorsion and Ulm factors of cotorsion groups are algebraically compact.
