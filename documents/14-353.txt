   Cameron Leigh Stewart      Cameron Leigh Stewart   Cameron Leigh Stewart  FRSC is a Canadian  mathematician . He is a professor of pure mathematics at the University of Waterloo . He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1989. He was appointed Fellow of the Fields Institute in 2008. Since 2003 he has held a Canada Research Chair (tier 1). 1 Since 2005 he has been appointed University Professor at the University of Waterloo. 2  He made numerous contributions to number theory , in particular the abc conjecture . In 1976 he obtained, with Alan Baker , an effective improvement to Liouville's Theorem . In 1991 he proved that the number of solutions to a Thue equation      f   (  x  ,  y  )    =  h        f   x  y    h    f(x,y)=h   is at most    2800   (   1  +    1  /  4   ϵ   deg  f     )     (   deg  f   )    1  +   ω   (  g  )          2800    1      1  4   ϵ   degree  f      superscript   degree  f     1    ω  g       2800(1+1/4\epsilon\deg f)(\deg f)^{1+\omega(g)}   , where   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   is a pre-determined positive real number and    ω   (  g  )       ω  g    \omega(g)   is the number of distinct primes dividing a large divisor   g   g   g   of   h   h   h   . This improves on an earlier result of Enrico Bombieri and Wolfgang M. Schmidt and is close to the best possible result. In 1995 he obtained, along with Jaap Top , the existence of infinitely many quadratic, cubic, and sextic twists of elliptic curves of large rank. In 1991 and 2001 respectively, he obtained, along with Kunrui Yu, the best unconditional estimates for the abc conjecture . In 2013, he solved an old problem of Erdős involving Lucas and Lehmer numbers. In particular, he proved that the largest prime divisor    P   (  n  )       P  n    P(n)   of     2  n   -  1       superscript  2  n   1    2^{n}-1   satisfies      lim   n  →  ∞      P   (  n  )    /  n    =  ∞        subscript    normal-→  n         P  n   n       \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}P(n)/n=\infty   . He was selected to give the annual Isidore and Hilda Dressler Lecture at Kansas State University in 2015.  Stewart completed a B.Sc. at the University of British Columbia in 1971 and a M.Sc in 1972 from McGill University . He earned his doctorate from the University of Cambridge in 1976, under supervision of Alan Baker . 3 While at Cambridge he was awarded the J.T. Knight Prize in 1974.  Stewart has Erdős number 1.
