HD 10180 c

HD 10180 c is an extrasolar planet approximately 130 light-years away in the constellation Hydrus. With a minimum mass comparable to that of Neptune, it is of the class of planets known as Hot Neptunes. Dynamical simulations suggest that if the mass gradient was any more than a factor of two, the system would not be stable.  While planet c does not exist in any mean motion resonances, both planets with adjacent orbits (b and d) share near resonances with c.
