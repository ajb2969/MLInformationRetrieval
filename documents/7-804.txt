   Donsker's theorem      Donsker's theorem   In probability theory , Donsker's theorem , named after Monroe D. Donsker , identifies a certain stochastic process as a limit of empirical processes . It is sometimes called the functional central limit theorem .  A centered and scaled version of empirical distribution function  F n defines an empirical process        G  n    (  x  )    =    n    (     F  n    (  x  )    -   F   (  x  )     )           subscript  G  n   x       n        subscript  F  n   x     F  x       G_{n}(x)=\sqrt{n}(F_{n}(x)-F(x))\,     indexed by x ‚àà R .  Theorem (Donsker, Skorokhod, Kolmogorov) The sequence of G n ( x ), as random elements of the Skorokhod space     ùíü   (   -  ‚àû   ,  ‚àû  )       ùíü           \mathcal{D}(-\infty,\infty)   , converges in distribution to a Gaussian process  G with zero mean and covariance given by        cov   [   G   (  s  )    ,   G   (  t  )    ]    =   E   [   G   (  s  )   G   (  t  )    ]    =    min   {   F   (  s  )    ,   F   (  t  )    }    -   F   (  s  )   F   (  t  )      .         cov    G  s     G  t      E   delimited-[]    G  s  G  t                F  s     F  t      F  s  F  t       \operatorname{cov}[G(s),G(t)]=E[G(s)G(t)]=\min\{F(s),F(t)\}-F(s)F(t).\,   The process G ( x ) can be written as B ( F ( x )) where B is a standard Brownian bridge on the unit interval.  History  By the classical central limit theorem , for fixed x , the random variable G n ( x ) converges in distribution to a Gaussian (normal)  random variable  G ( x ) with zero mean and variance F ( x )(1¬†‚àí F ( x )) as the sample size n grows.  Kolmogorov (1933) showed that when F is continuous , the supremum     sup  t     G  n    (  t  )        subscript  supremum  t      subscript  G  n   t     \scriptstyle\sup_{t}G_{n}(t)   and supremum of absolute value,     sup  t    |    G  n    (  t  )    |       subscript  supremum  t        subscript  G  n   t      \scriptstyle\sup_{t}|G_{n}(t)|    converges in distribution to the laws of the same functionals of the Brownian bridge  B ( t ), see the Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov test . In 1949 Doob asked whether the convergence in distribution held for more general functionals, thus formulating a problem of weak convergence of random functions in a suitable function space . 1  In 1952 Donsker stated and proved (not quite correctly) 2 a general extension for the Doob-Kolmogorov heuristic approach. In the original paper, Donsker proved that the convergence in law of G n to the Brownian bridge holds for Uniform[0,1 ] distributions with respect to uniform convergence in t over the interval [0,1]. 3  However Donsker's formulation was not quite correct because of the problem of measurability of the functionals of discontinuous processes. In 1956 Skorokhod and Kolmogorov defined a separable metric d , called the Skorokhod metric , on the space of cadlag functions on [0,1], such that convergence for d to a continuous function is equivalent to convergence for the sup norm, and showed that G n converges in law in    ùíü   [  0  ,  1  ]       ùíü   0  1     \mathcal{D}[0,1]   to the Brownian bridge.  Later Dudley reformulated Donsker's result to avoid the problem of measurability and the need of the Skorokhod metric. One can prove 4 that there exist X i , iid uniform in [0,1] and a sequence of sample-continuous Brownian bridges B n , such that       ‚à•    G  n   -   B  n    ‚à•   ‚àû     subscript   norm     subscript  G  n    subscript  B  n        \|G_{n}-B_{n}\|_{\infty}   is measurable and converges in probability to 0. An improved version of this result, providing more detail on the rate of convergence, is the Koml√≥s‚ÄìMajor‚ÄìTusn√°dy approximation .
