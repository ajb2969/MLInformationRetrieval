Complex conjugate vector space

In mathematics, the (formal) complex conjugate of a complex vector space

 
  is the complex vector space 
 
 
 
  consisting of all formal complex conjugates of elements of 
 
 
 
 . That is, 
 
 
 
 
  is a vector space whose elements are in one-to-one correspondence with the elements of 
 
 
 
 :


 
  with the following rules for addition and scalar multiplication:


 
  Here 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are vectors in 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a complex number, and 
 
 
 
  denotes the complex conjugate of 
 
 
 
 .
More concretely, the complex conjugate vector space is the same underlying real vector space (same set of points, same vector addition and real scalar multiplication) with the conjugate linear complex structure J (different multiplication by i).
Antilinear maps
If 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are complex vector spaces, a function 
 
 
 
  is antilinear if


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 .
One reason to consider the vector space 
 
 
 
  is that it makes antilinear maps into linear maps. Specifically, if 
 
 
 
  is an antilinear map, then the corresponding map 
 
 
 
  defined by


 
  is linear. Conversely, any linear map defined on 
 
 
 
 
  gives rise to an antilinear map on 
 
 
 
 .
One way of thinking about this correspondence is that the map 
 
 
 
  defined by


 
  is an antilinear bijection. Thus if 
 
 
 
  is linear, then composition

 
 
  is antilinear, and vice versa.
Conjugate linear maps
Any linear map 
 
 
 
  induces a conjugate linear map

 
 , defined by the formula


 
  The conjugate linear map 
 
 
 
  is linear. Moreover, the identity map on 
 
 
 
 
  induces the identity map 
 
 
 
 , and


 
  for any two linear maps 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Therefore, the rules 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  define a functor from the category of complex vector spaces to itself.
If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are finite-dimensional and the map 
 
 
 
  is described by the complex matrix

 
 
  with respect to the bases

 
  of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , then the map 
 
 
 
 
  is described by the complex conjugate of 
 
 
 
  with respect to the bases 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 
 .
Structure of the conjugate
The vector spaces 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  have the same dimension over the complex numbers and are therefore isomorphic as complex vector spaces. However, there is no natural isomorphism from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . (The map 
 
 
 
 
  is not an isomorphism, since it is antilinear.)
The double conjugate 
 
 
 
  is naturally isomorphic to 
 
 
 
 , with the isomorphism 
 
 
 
  defined by


 
  Usually the double conjugate of 
 
 
 
 
  is simply identified with 
 
 
 
 .
Complex conjugate of a Hilbert space
Given a Hilbert space

 
  (either finite or infinite dimensional), its complex conjugate 
 
 
 
  is the same vector space as its continuous dual space

 
 . There is one-to-one antilinear correspondence between continuous linear functionals and vectors. In other words, any continuous linear functional on 
 
 
 
 
  is an inner multiplication to some fixed vector, and vice versa.
Thus, the complex conjugate to a vector 
 
 
 
 , particularly in finite dimension case, may be denoted as 
 
 
 
  (v-star, a row vector which is the conjugate transpose to a column vector 
 
 
 
 ). In quantum mechanics, the conjugate to a ket vector 
 
 
 
  is denoted as 
 
 
 
 
  – a bra vector (see bra–ket notation).
