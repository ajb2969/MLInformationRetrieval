(R)-limonene synthase




(R)-limonene synthase

In enzymology, a (R)-limonene synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

geranyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  (+)-(4R)-limonene + diphosphate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, geranyl diphosphate, and two products, (+)-(4R)-limonene and diphosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on phosphates. The systematic name of this enzyme class is geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase [cyclizing, (+)-(4R)-limonene-forming]. Other names in common use include (+)-limonene synthase, and geranyldiphosphate diphosphate lyase [(+)-(R)-limonene-forming]. This enzyme participates in monoterpenoid biosynthesis.
