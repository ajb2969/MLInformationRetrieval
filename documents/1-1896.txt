   Absolute convergence      Absolute convergence   In mathematics , an infinite series of numbers is said to converge absolutely (or to be absolutely convergent ) if the sum of the absolute value of the summand is finite. More precisely, a real or complex series     ‚àë   n  =  0   ‚àû    a  n       superscript   subscript     n  0       subscript  a  n     \textstyle\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}   is said to converge absolutely if      ‚àë   n  =  0   ‚àû    |   a  n   |    =  L        superscript   subscript     n  0         subscript  a  n     L    \textstyle\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left|a_{n}\right|=L   for some real number   L   L   \textstyle L   . Similarly, an improper integral of a function ,     ‚à´  0  ‚àû    f   (  x  )   d  x       superscript   subscript   0       f  x  d  x     \textstyle\int_{0}^{\infty}f(x)\,dx   , is said to converge absolutely if the integral of the absolute value of the integrand is finite‚Äîthat is, if       ‚à´  0  ‚àû     |   f   (  x  )    |   d  x    =  L   .        superscript   subscript   0           f  x    d  x    L    \textstyle\int_{0}^{\infty}\left|f(x)\right|dx=L.     Absolute convergence is important for the study of infinite series because its definition is strong enough to have properties of finite sums that not all convergent series possess, yet is broad enough to occur commonly. (A convergent series that is not absolutely convergent is called conditionally convergent .)  Background  One may study the convergence of series     ‚àë   n  =  0   ‚àû    a  n       superscript   subscript     n  0       subscript  a  n     \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}   whose terms a n are elements of an arbitrary abelian topological group . The notion of absolute convergence requires more structure, namely a norm , which is a real-valued function    ‚à•  ‚ãÖ  ‚à•  :  G  ‚Üí  ‚Ñù     fragments  parallel-to  normal-‚ãÖ  parallel-to  normal-:  G  normal-‚Üí  R    \|\cdot\|:G\to\mathbb{R}   on abelian group G (written additively , with identity element 0) such that:   The norm of the identity element of G is zero     ‚à•  0  ‚à•   =  0.       norm  0   0.    \|0\|=0.     For every x in G ,     ‚à•  x  ‚à•   =  0       norm  x   0    \|x\|=0   implies    x  =  0.      x  0.    x=0.     For every x in G ,      ‚à•   -  x   ‚à•   =   ‚à•  x  ‚à•    .       norm    x     norm  x     \|-x\|=\|x\|.     For every x , y in G ,      ‚à•   x  +  y   ‚à•   ‚â§    ‚à•  x  ‚à•   +   ‚à•  y  ‚à•     .       norm    x  y       norm  x    norm  y      \|x+y\|\leq\|x\|+\|y\|.      In this case, the function     d   (  x  ,  y  )    =   ‚à•   x  -  y   ‚à•         d   x  y     norm    x  y      d(x,y)=\|x-y\|   induces on G the structure of a metric space (a type of topology ). We can therefore consider G -valued series and define such a series to be absolutely convergent if       ‚àë   n  =  0   ‚àû    ‚à•   a  n   ‚à•    <  ‚àû   .        superscript   subscript     n  0       norm   subscript  a  n        \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\|a_{n}\|<\infty.     In particular, these statements apply using the norm | x | ( absolute value ) in the space of real numbers or complex numbers.  Relation to convergence  If G is complete with respect to the metric d , then every absolutely convergent series is convergent. The proof is the same as for complex-valued series: use the completeness to derive the Cauchy criterion for convergence‚Äîa series is convergent if and only if its tails can be made arbitrarily small in norm‚Äîand apply the triangle inequality.  In particular, for series with values in any Banach space , absolute convergence implies convergence. The converse is also true: if absolute convergence implies convergence in a normed space, then the space is a Banach space.  If a series is convergent but not absolutely convergent, it is called conditionally convergent . An example of a conditionally convergent series is the alternating harmonic series . Many standard tests for divergence and convergence, most notably including the ratio test and the root test , demonstrate absolute convergence. This is because a power series is absolutely convergent on the interior of its disk of convergence.  Proof that any absolutely convergent series of complex numbers is convergent  Since a series of complex numbers converges if and only if both its real and imaginary parts converge, we may assume with equal generality that the    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   are real numbers. Suppose that    ‚àë   |   a  n   |          subscript  a  n      \sum|a_{n}|   is convergent. Then,    2   ‚àë   |   a  n   |        2       subscript  a  n       2\sum|a_{n}|   is convergent.  Since    0  ‚â§    a  n   +   |   a  n   |    ‚â§   2   |   a  n   |          0     subscript  a  n      subscript  a  n            2     subscript  a  n        0\leq a_{n}+|a_{n}|\leq 2|a_{n}|   , we have      0  ‚â§    ‚àë   n  =  1   m    (    a  n   +   |   a  n   |    )    ‚â§    ‚àë   n  =  1   m    2   |   a  n   |     ‚â§    ‚àë   n  =  1   ‚àû    2   |   a  n   |           0    superscript   subscript     n  1    m      subscript  a  n      subscript  a  n             superscript   subscript     n  1    m     2     subscript  a  n             superscript   subscript     n  1        2     subscript  a  n         0\leq\sum_{n=1}^{m}(a_{n}+|a_{n}|)\leq\sum_{n=1}^{m}2|a_{n}|\leq\sum_{n=1}^{%
 \infty}2|a_{n}|   . Thus,     ‚àë   n  =  1   m    (    a  n   +   |   a  n   |    )       superscript   subscript     n  1    m      subscript  a  n      subscript  a  n       \sum_{n=1}^{m}(a_{n}+|a_{n}|)   is a bounded monotonic sequence (in m ), which must converge.       ‚àë   a  n    =    ‚àë   (    a  n   +   |   a  n   |    )    -   ‚àë   |   a  n   |            subscript  a  n           subscript  a  n      subscript  a  n           subscript  a  n        \sum a_{n}=\sum(a_{n}+|a_{n}|)-\sum|a_{n}|   is a difference of convergent series; therefore, it is also convergent, as desired.  Proof that any absolutely convergent series in a Banach space is convergent  The above result can be easily generalized to every Banach space . Let be an absolutely convergent series in X . As     ‚àë   k  =  1   n    ‚à•   x  k   ‚à•       superscript   subscript     k  1    n    norm   subscript  x  k      \scriptstyle\sum_{k=1}^{n}\|x_{k}\|   is a Cauchy sequence of real numbers, for any  and large enough natural numbers  it holds:        |     ‚àë   k  =  1   m    ‚à•   x  k   ‚à•    -    ‚àë   k  =  1   n    ‚à•   x  k   ‚à•     |   =    ‚àë   k  =   n  +  1    m    ‚à•   x  k   ‚à•    <  Œµ   .              superscript   subscript     k  1    m    norm   subscript  x  k       superscript   subscript     k  1    n    norm   subscript  x  k         superscript   subscript     k    n  1     m    norm   subscript  x  k          Œµ     \left|\sum_{k=1}^{m}\|x_{k}\|-\sum_{k=1}^{n}\|x_{k}\|\right|=\sum_{k=n+1}^{m}%
 \|x_{k}\|<\varepsilon.     By the triangle inequality for the norm , one immediately gets:        ‚à•     ‚àë   k  =  1   m    x  k    -    ‚àë   k  =  1   n    x  k     ‚à•   =   ‚à•    ‚àë   k  =   n  +  1    m    x  k    ‚à•   ‚â§    ‚àë   k  =   n  +  1    m    ‚à•   x  k   ‚à•    <  Œµ   ,         norm      superscript   subscript     k  1    m    subscript  x  k      superscript   subscript     k  1    n    subscript  x  k       norm    superscript   subscript     k    n  1     m    subscript  x  k            superscript   subscript     k    n  1     m    norm   subscript  x  k          Œµ     \left\|\sum_{k=1}^{m}x_{k}-\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{k}\right\|=\left\|\sum_{k=n+1}^{m}%
 x_{k}\right\|\leq\sum_{k=n+1}^{m}\|x_{k}\|<\varepsilon,   which means that     ‚àë   k  =  1   n    x  k       superscript   subscript     k  1    n    subscript  x  k     \scriptstyle\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{k}   is a Cauchy sequence in X , hence the series is convergent in X . 1  Rearrangements and unconditional convergence  In the general context of a G -valued series, a distinction is made between absolute and unconditional convergence, and the assertion that a real or complex series which is not absolutely convergent is necessarily conditionally convergent (meaning not unconditionally convergent) is then a theorem, not a definition. This is discussed in more detail below.  Given a series     ‚àë   n  =  0   ‚àû    a  n       superscript   subscript     n  0       subscript  a  n     \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}   with values in a normed abelian group G and a permutation œÉ of the natural numbers, one builds a new series     ‚àë   n  =  0   ‚àû    a   œÉ   (  n  )         superscript   subscript     n  0       subscript  a    œÉ  n      \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{\sigma(n)}   , said to be a rearrangement of the original series. A series is said to be unconditionally convergent if all rearrangements of the series are convergent to the same value.  When G is complete, absolute convergence implies unconditional convergence:   Theorem. Let        ‚àë   i  =  1   ‚àû    a  i    =  A  ‚àà  G   ,     ‚àë   i  =  1   ‚àû    ‚à•   a  i   ‚à•    <  ‚àû      formulae-sequence        superscript   subscript     i  1       subscript  a  i    A       G        superscript   subscript     i  1       norm   subscript  a  i         \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}a_{i}=A\in G,\quad\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\|a_{i}\|<\infty      and let    œÉ  :   ùêç  ‚Üí  ùêç      normal-:  œÉ    ùêç  normal-‚Üí  ùêç     œÉ:\mathbf{N}‚Üí\mathbf{N}   be a permutation. Then:        ‚àë   i  =  1   ‚àû    a   œÉ   (  i  )      =  A   .        superscript   subscript     i  1       subscript  a    œÉ  i     A    \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}a_{\sigma(i)}=A.       The issue of the converse is interesting. For real series it follows from the Riemann rearrangement theorem that unconditional convergence implies absolute convergence. Since a series with values in a finite-dimensional normed space is absolutely convergent if each of its one-dimensional projections is absolutely convergent, it follows that absolute and unconditional convergence coincide for R n -valued series.  But there are unconditionally and non-absolutely convergent series with values in Hilbert space ‚Ñì 2 , for example:        a  n   =     1  n     e  n     ,       subscript  a  n       1  n    subscript  e  n      a_{n}=\tfrac{1}{n}e_{n},     where     {   e  n   }    n  =  1   ‚àû     superscript   subscript    subscript  e  n      n  1       \{e_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}   is an orthonormal basis. A theorem of A.¬†Dvoretzky and C.¬†A.¬†Rogers 2 asserts that every infinite-dimensional Banach space admits an unconditionally convergent series that is not absolutely convergent.  Proof of the theorem  For any Œµ > 0, we can choose some      Œ∫  Œµ   ,   Œª  Œµ    ‚àà  ùêç        subscript  Œ∫  Œµ    subscript  Œª  Œµ    ùêç    \kappa_{\varepsilon},\lambda_{\varepsilon}\in\mathbf{N}   , such that:       ‚àÄ  N   >   Œ∫  Œµ        for-all  N    subscript  Œ∫  Œµ     \displaystyle\forall N>\kappa_{\varepsilon}     Let      N  Œµ     subscript  N  Œµ    \displaystyle N_{\varepsilon}     Finally for any integer    N  >   M   œÉ  ,  Œµ        N   subscript  M   œÉ  Œµ      N>M_{\sigma,\varepsilon}   let      I   œÉ  ,  Œµ      subscript  I   œÉ  Œµ     \displaystyle I_{\sigma,\varepsilon}     Then      ‚à•      ‚àë   i  =  1   N     a   œÉ   (  i  )      -  A   ‚à•     norm      superscript   subscript     i  1    N    subscript  a    œÉ  i     A     \displaystyle\left\|\sum_{i=1}^{N}a_{\sigma(i)}-A\right\|     This shows that         ‚àÄ  Œµ   >   0  ,   ‚àÉ   M   œÉ  ,  Œµ       ,     ‚àÄ  N   >   M   œÉ  ,  Œµ       ‚à•     ‚àë   i  =  1   N    a   œÉ   (  i  )      -  A   ‚à•   <  Œµ     ,     formulae-sequence     for-all  Œµ    0     subscript  M   œÉ  Œµ        formulae-sequence     for-all  N    subscript  M   œÉ  Œµ        norm      superscript   subscript     i  1    N    subscript  a    œÉ  i     A    Œµ      \forall\varepsilon>0,\exists M_{\sigma,\varepsilon},\forall N>M_{\sigma,%
 \varepsilon}\quad\left\|\sum_{i=1}^{N}a_{\sigma(i)}-A\right\|<\varepsilon,     that is:        ‚àë   i  =  1   ‚àû    a   œÉ   (  i  )      =  A        superscript   subscript     i  1       subscript  a    œÉ  i     A    \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}a_{\sigma(i)}=A     Q.E.D.  Products of series  The Cauchy product of two series converges to the product of the sums if at least one of the series converges absolutely. That is, suppose that        ‚àë   n  =  0   ‚àû    a  n    =  A        superscript   subscript     n  0       subscript  a  n    A    \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}=A   and      ‚àë   n  =  0   ‚àû    b  n    =  B        superscript   subscript     n  0       subscript  b  n    B    \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_{n}=B   .  The Cauchy product is defined as the sum of terms c n where:        c  n   =    ‚àë   k  =  0   n     a  k    b   n  -  k       .       subscript  c  n     superscript   subscript     k  0    n      subscript  a  k    subscript  b    n  k        c_{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}a_{k}b_{n-k}.     Then, if either the a n or b n sum converges absolutely, then         ‚àë   n  =  0   ‚àû    c  n    =   A  B    .        superscript   subscript     n  0       subscript  c  n      A  B     \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{n}=AB.     Absolute convergence of integrals  The integral     ‚à´  A    f   (  x  )   d  x       subscript   A     f  x  d  x     \int_{A}f(x)\,dx   of a real or complex-valued function is said to converge absolutely if       ‚à´  A     |   f   (  x  )    |   d  x    <  ‚àû   .        subscript   A         f  x    d  x       \int_{A}\left|f(x)\right|\,dx<\infty.   One also says that f is absolutely integrable .  When A = [ a , b ] is a closed bounded interval, every continuous function is integrable, and since f continuous implies | f | continuous, similarly every continuous function is absolutely integrable. It is not generally true that absolutely integrable functions on [ a , b ] are integrable: let    S  ‚äÇ   [  a  ,  b  ]       S   a  b     S\subset[a,b]   be a nonmeasurable subset and take     f  =    œá  S   -   1  /  2     ,      f     subscript  œá  S     1  2      f=\chi_{S}-1/2,   where    œá  S     subscript  œá  S    \chi_{S}   is the characteristic function of S. Then f is not Lebesgue measurable but | f | is constant. However, it is a standard result that if f is Riemann integrable, so is | f |. This holds also for the Lebesgue integral; see below. On the other hand a function f may be Kurzweil-Henstock integrable (or "gauge integrable") while | f | is not. This includes the case of improperly Riemann integrable functions.  Similarly, when A is an interval of infinite length it is well known that there are improperly Riemann integrable functions f which are not absolutely integrable. Indeed, given any series     ‚àë   n  =  0   ‚àû    a  n       superscript   subscript     n  0       subscript  a  n     \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}   one can consider the associated step function     f  a   :    [  0  ,  ‚àû  )   ‚Üí  ùêë      normal-:   subscript  f  a    normal-‚Üí   0    ùêë     f_{a}:[0,\infty)\rightarrow\mathbf{R}   defined by      f  a    (   [  n  ,   n  +  1   )   )    =   a  n          subscript  f  a    n    n  1      subscript  a  n     f_{a}([n,n+1))=a_{n}   . Then     ‚à´  0  ‚àû      f  a    d  x       superscript   subscript   0        subscript  f  a   d  x     \int_{0}^{\infty}f_{a}\,dx   converges absolutely, converges conditionally or diverges according to the corresponding behavior of      ‚àë   n  =  0   ‚àû    a  n    .      superscript   subscript     n  0       subscript  a  n     \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}.     Another example of a convergent but not absolutely convergent improper Riemann integral is     ‚à´  ùêë       sin  x   x    d  x       subscript   ùêë         x   x   d  x     \int_{\mathbf{R}}\frac{\sin x}{x}\,dx   .  On any measure space A, the Lebesgue integral of a real-valued function is defined in terms of its positive and negative parts, so the facts:   f integrable implies | f | integrable  f measurable, | f | integrable implies f integrable   are essentially built into the definition of the Lebesgue integral. In particular, applying the theory to the counting measure on a set S , one recovers the notion of unordered summation of series developed by Moore‚ÄìSmith using (what are now called) nets. When S = N is the set of natural numbers, Lebesgue integrability, unordered summability and absolute convergence all coincide.  Finally, all of the above holds for integrals with values in a Banach space. The definition of a Banach-valued Riemann integral is an evident modification of the usual one. For the Lebesgue integral one needs to circumvent the decomposition into positive and negative parts with Daniell's more functional analytic approach, obtaining the Bochner integral .
