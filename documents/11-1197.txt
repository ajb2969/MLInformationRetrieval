   Aldose beta-D-fructosyltransferase      Aldose beta-D-fructosyltransferase   In enzymology , an aldose beta-D-fructosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   alpha-D-aldosyl 1 beta-D-fructoside + D-aldose 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-aldose 1 + alpha-D-aldosyl 2 beta-D-fructoside   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are alpha-D-aldosyl1 beta-D-fructoside and D-aldose2 , whereas its two products are D-aldose1 and alpha-D-aldosyl2 beta-D-fructoside .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alpha-D-aldosyl-beta-D-fructoside:aldose 1-beta-D-fructosyltransferase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
