   Cobalt-precorrin-5B (C1)-methyltransferase      Cobalt-precorrin-5B (C1)-methyltransferase   Cobalt-precorrin-5B (C 1 )-methyltransferase (, cobalt-precorrin-6A synthase , CbiD (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:cobalt-precorrin-5B (C 1 )-methyltransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   cobalt-precorrin-5B + S-adenosyl-L-methionine    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    cobalt-precorrin-6A + S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine    This enzyme catalyses the C-1 methylation of cobalt-precorrin-5B in the anaerobic pathway of adenosylcobalamin biosynthesis.
