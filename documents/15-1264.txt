Cobalt-precorrin-5B (C1)-methyltransferase

Cobalt-precorrin-5B (C1)-methyltransferase (, cobalt-precorrin-6A synthase, CbiD (gene)) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:cobalt-precorrin-5B (C1)-methyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

cobalt-precorrin-5B + S-adenosyl-L-methionine

cobalt-precorrin-6A + S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine


This enzyme catalyses the C-1 methylation of cobalt-precorrin-5B in the anaerobic pathway of adenosylcobalamin biosynthesis.
