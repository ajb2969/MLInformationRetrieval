   Saturated measure      Saturated measure   In mathematics , a measure is said to be saturated if every locally measurable set is also measurable . 1 A set   E   E   E   , not necessarily measurable, is said to be locally measurable if for every measurable set   A   A   A   of finite measure,    E  ∩  A      E  A    E\cap A   is measurable.   σ   σ   \sigma   -finite measures, and measures arising as the restriction of outer measures , are saturated.
