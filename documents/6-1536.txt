Saturated measure

In mathematics, a measure is said to be saturated if every locally measurable set is also measurable.1 A set 
 
 
 
 , not necessarily measurable, is said to be locally measurable if for every measurable set 
 
 
 
  of finite measure, 
 
 
 
  is measurable. 
 
 
 
 -finite measures, and measures arising as the restriction of outer measures, are saturated.
