   Localization of a category      Localization of a category   In mathematics , localization of a category consists of adding to a category inverse morphisms for some collection of morphisms, constraining them to become isomorphisms . This is formally similar to the process of localization of a ring ; it in general makes objects isomorphic that were not so before. In homotopy theory , for example, there are many examples of mappings that are invertible up to homotopy; and so large classes of homotopy equivalent spaces. Calculus of fractions is another name for working in a localized category.  Introduction and motivation  A category  C consists of objects and morphisms between these objects. The morphisms reflect relations between the objects. In many situations, it is meaningful to replace C by another category C ' in which certain morphisms are forced to be isomorphisms. This process is called localization.  For example, in the category of R - modules (for some fixed commutative ring R ) the multiplication by a fixed element r of R is typically (i.e., unless r is a unit ) not an isomorphism:        M  →  M    m  ↦   r  ⋅  m     .     formulae-sequence   normal-→  M  M    maps-to  m   normal-⋅  r  m      M\to M\quad m\mapsto r\cdot m.   The category that is most closely related to R -modules, but where this map is an isomorphism turns out to be the category of    R   [   S   -  1    ]       R   delimited-[]   superscript  S    1       R[S^{-1}]   -modules. Here    R   [   S   -  1    ]       R   delimited-[]   superscript  S    1       R[S^{-1}]   is the localization of R with respect to the (multiplicatively closed) subset S consisting of all powers of r ,    S  =   {  1  ,  r  ,   r  2   ,   r  3   ,  …  }       S   1  r   superscript  r  2    superscript  r  3   normal-…     S=\{1,r,r^{2},r^{3},\dots\}   The expression "most closely related" is formalized by two conditions: first, there is a functor      φ  :     Mod  R   →   Mod   R   [   S   -  1    ]       M  ↦   M   [   S   -  1    ]         normal-:  φ   formulae-sequence   normal-→   subscript  Mod  R    subscript  Mod    R   delimited-[]   superscript  S    1         maps-to  M    M   delimited-[]   superscript  S    1          \varphi:\text{Mod}_{R}\to\text{Mod}_{R[S^{-1}]}\quad M\mapsto M[S^{-1}]   sending any R -module to its localization with respect to S . Moreover, given any category C and any functor      F  :    Mod  R   →  C      normal-:  F   normal-→   subscript  Mod  R   C     F:\text{Mod}_{R}\to C   sending the multiplication map by r on any R -module (see above) to an isomorphism of C , there is a unique functor      G  :    Mod   R   [   S   -  1    ]     →  C      normal-:  G   normal-→   subscript  Mod    R   delimited-[]   superscript  S    1       C     G:\text{Mod}_{R[S^{-1}]}\to C   such that    F  =   G  ∘  φ       F    G  φ     F=G\circ\varphi   .  Localization of categories  The above examples of localization of R -modules is abstracted in the following definition. In this shape, it applies in many more examples, some of which are sketched below.  Given a category  C and some class W of morphisms in C , the localization C [ W −1 ] is another category which is obtained by inverting all the morphisms in W . More formally, it is characterized by a universal property : there is a natural localization functor C → C [ W −1 ] and given another category D , a functor F : C → D factors uniquely over C [ W −1 ] if and only if F sends all arrows in W to isomorphisms.  Thus, the localization of the category is unique provided that it exists. One construction of the localization is done by declaring that its objects are the same as those in C , but the morphisms are enhanced by adding a formal inverse for each morphism in W . Under suitable hypotheses on W , the morphisms between two objects X , Y are given by roofs      X   ←  f    X  ′   →  Y        superscript  normal-←  f   X   superscript  X  normal-′     normal-→    Y     X\stackrel{f}{\leftarrow}X^{\prime}\rightarrow Y   (where X ' is an arbitrary object of C and f is in the given class W of morphisms), modulo certain equivalence relations. These relations turn the map going in the "wrong" direction into an inverse of f . This procedure, however, in general yields a proper class of morphisms between them. Typically, the morphisms in a category are only allowed to form a set. Some authors simply ignore such set-theoretic issues.  Model categories  A rigorous construction of localization of categories, avoiding these set-theoretic issues, was one of the initial reasons for the development of the theory of model categories : a model category M is a category in which there are three classes of maps; one of classes is a class of weak equivalences . The homotopy category Ho( M ) is then the localization with respect to the weak equivalences. The axioms of a model category ensure that this localization can be defined without set-theoretical difficulties.  Alternative definition  Some authors also define a localization of a category C to be an idempotent and coaugmented functor. A coaugmented functor is a pair (L,l) where L:C → C is an endofunctor and l:Id → L is a natural transformation from the identity functor to L (called the coaugmentation). A coaugmented functor is idempotent if, for every X , both maps L(l X ),l L(X) :L(X) → LL(X) are isomorphisms. It can be proven that in this case, both maps are equal. 1  This definition is related to the one given above as follows: applying the first definition, there is, in many situations, not only a canonical functor    C  →   C   [   W   -  1    ]       normal-→  C    C   delimited-[]   superscript  W    1        C\to C[W^{-1}]   , but also a functor in the opposite direction,       C   [   W   -  1    ]    →  C     normal-→    C   delimited-[]   superscript  W    1      C    C[W^{-1}]\to C   For example, modules over the localization    R   [   S   -  1    ]       R   delimited-[]   superscript  S    1       R[S^{-1}]   of a ring are also modules over R itself, giving a functor         R   [   S   -  1    ]    -   M  o  d    →   R  -   M  o  d     .     normal-→      R   delimited-[]   superscript  S    1        M  o  d      R    M  o  d      R[S^{-1}]-Mod\to R-Mod.   In this case, the composition      L  :   C  →   C   [   W   -  1    ]    →  C      normal-:  L     normal-→  C    C   delimited-[]   superscript  W    1        normal-→    C      L:C\to C[W^{-1}]\to C   is a localization of C in the sense of an idempotent and coaugmented functor.  Examples  Serre's C -theory  Serre introduced the idea of working in homotopy theory  modulo some class C of abelian groups . This meant that groups A and B were treated as isomorphic, if for example A/B lay in C . Later Dennis Sullivan had the bold idea instead of using the localization of a topological space , which took effect on the underlying topological spaces .  Module theory  In the theory of modules over a commutative ring  R , when R has Krull dimension ≥ 2, it can be useful to treat modules M and N as pseudo-isomorphic if M/N has support of codimension at least two. This idea is much used in Iwasawa theory .  Derived categories  The derived category of an abelian category is much used in homological algebra . It is the localization of the category of chain complexes (up to homotopy) with respect to the quasi-isomorphisms .  Abelian varieties up to isogeny  An isogeny from an abelian variety  A to another one B is a surjective morphism with finite kernel . Some theorems on abelian varieties require the idea of abelian variety up to isogeny for their convenient statement. For example, given an abelian subvariety A 1 of A , there is another subvariety A 2 of A such that   A 1 × A 2    is isogenous to A (Poincaré's theorem: see for example Abelian Varieties by David Mumford ). To call this a direct sum decomposition, we should work in the category of abelian varieties up to isogeny.  Related concepts  The localization of a topological space produces another topological space whose homology is a localization of the homology of the original space.  A much more general concept from homotopical algebra , including as special cases both the localization of spaces and of categories, is the Bousfield localization of a model category . Bousfield localization forces certain maps to become weak equivalences , which is in general weaker than forcing them to become isomorphisms. 2  See also   Simplicial localization   References    "  Category:Category theory  Category:Localization (mathematics)     Idempotents in Monoidal Categories ↩  Philip S.
