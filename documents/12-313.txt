   First variation of area formula      First variation of area formula   In Riemannian geometry , the first variation of area formula relates the mean curvature of a hypersurface to the rate of change of its area as it evolves in the outward normal direction.  Let    Σ   (  t  )       normal-Σ  t    \Sigma(t)   be a smooth family of oriented hypersurfaces in a Riemannian manifold  M such that the velocity of each point is given by the outward unit normal at that point. The first variation of area formula is          d   d  t     d  A   =    H   d  A    ,          d    d  t    d  A     H  d  A     \frac{d}{dt}\,dA=H\,dA,     where dA is the area form on    Σ   (  t  )       normal-Σ  t    \Sigma(t)   induced by the metric of M , and H is the mean curvature of    Σ   (  t  )       normal-Σ  t    \Sigma(t)   . The normal vector is parallel to     D  α     e  →   β        subscript  D  α    subscript   normal-→  e   β     D_{\alpha}\vec{e}_{\beta}   where     e  →   β     subscript   normal-→  e   β    \vec{e}_{\beta}   is the tangent vector. The mean curvature is parallel to the normal vector.  References   Chow, Lu, and Ni, "Hamilton's Ricci Flow." AMS Science Press, GSM volume 77, 2006.   "  Category:Riemannian geometry
