   Semi-local ring      Semi-local ring   In mathematics , a semi-local ring is a ring for which R /J( R ) is a semisimple ring , where J( R ) is the Jacobson radical of R .  The above definition is satisfied if R has a finite number of maximal right ideals (and finite number of maximal left ideals). When R is a commutative ring , the converse implication is also true, and so the definition of semi-local for commutative rings is often taken to be "having finitely many maximal ideals ".  Some literature refers to a commutative semi-local ring in general as a quasi-semi-local ring , using semi-local ring to refer to a Noetherian ring with finitely many maximal ideals.  A semi-local ring is thus more general than a local ring , which has only one maximal (right/left/two-sided) ideal.  Examples   Any right or left Artinian ring , any serial ring , and any semiperfect ring is semi-local.  The quotient     ℤ  /  m   ℤ        ℤ  m   ℤ    \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}   is a semi-local ring. In particular, if   m   m   m   is a prime power, then     ℤ  /  m   ℤ        ℤ  m   ℤ    \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}   is a local ring.  A finite direct sum of fields     ⊕   i  =  1   n    F  i       superscript   subscript  direct-sum    i  1    n    subscript  F  i     \bigoplus_{i=1}^{n}{F_{i}}   is a semi-local ring.  In the case of commutative rings with unity, this example is prototypical in the following sense: the Chinese remainder theorem shows that for a semi-local commutative ring R with unit and maximal ideals m 1 , ..., m n        R  /    ⋂   i  =  1   n    m  i     ≅    ⊕   i  =  1   n    R  /    m  i            R    superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  m  i       superscript   subscript  direct-sum    i  1    n     R   subscript  m  i       R/\bigcap_{i=1}^{n}m_{i}\cong\bigoplus_{i=1}^{n}R/m_{i}\,   .   (The map is the natural projection). The right hand side is a direct sum of fields. Here we note that ∩ i m i =J( R ), and we see that R /J( R ) is indeed a semisimple ring.    The classical ring of quotients for any commutative Noetherian ring is a semilocal ring.  The endomorphism ring of an Artinian module is a semilocal ring.  Semi-local rings occur for example in algebraic geometry when a (commutative) ring R is localized with respect to the multiplicatively closed subset S = ∩ (R \ p i ) , where the p i are finitely many prime ideals .
