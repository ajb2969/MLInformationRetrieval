Semi-local ring

In mathematics, a semi-local ring is a ring for which R/J(R) is a semisimple ring, where J(R) is the Jacobson radical of R. 
The above definition is satisfied if R has a finite number of maximal right ideals (and finite number of maximal left ideals). When R is a commutative ring, the converse implication is also true, and so the definition of semi-local for commutative rings is often taken to be "having finitely many maximal ideals".
Some literature refers to a commutative semi-local ring in general as a quasi-semi-local ring, using semi-local ring to refer to a Noetherian ring with finitely many maximal ideals.
A semi-local ring is thus more general than a local ring, which has only one maximal (right/left/two-sided) ideal.
Examples

Any right or left Artinian ring, any serial ring, and any semiperfect ring is semi-local.
The quotient 
 
 
 
  is a semi-local ring. In particular, if 
 
 
 
  is a prime power, then 
 
 
 
  is a local ring.
A finite direct sum of fields 
 
 
 
  is a semi-local ring.
In the case of commutative rings with unity, this example is prototypical in the following sense: the Chinese remainder theorem shows that for a semi-local commutative ring R with unit and maximal ideals m1, ..., mn



 
 .

(The map is the natural projection). The right hand side is a direct sum of fields. Here we note that ∩i mi=J(R), and we see that R/J(R) is indeed a semisimple ring.
 


The classical ring of quotients for any commutative Noetherian ring is a semilocal ring.
The endomorphism ring of an Artinian module is a semilocal ring.
Semi-local rings occur for example in algebraic geometry when a (commutative) ring R is localized with respect to the multiplicatively closed subset S = ∩ (R \ pi), where the pi are finitely many prime ideals.
