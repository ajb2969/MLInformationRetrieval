Beatty sequence

In mathematics, a Beatty sequence (or homogeneous Beatty sequence) is the sequence of integers found by taking the floor of the positive multiples of a positive irrational number. Beatty sequences are named after Samuel Beatty, who wrote about them in 1926.
Rayleigh's theorem, named after Lord Rayleigh, states that the complement of a Beatty sequence, consisting of the positive integers that are not in the sequence, is itself a Beatty sequence generated by a different irrational number.
Beatty sequences can also be used to generate Sturmian words.
Definition
A positive irrational number 
 
 
 
  generates the Beatty sequence



If 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is also a positive irrational number. They naturally satisfy



and the sequences


 
  and


 
  form a pair of complementary Beatty sequences.
A more general non-homogeneous Beatty sequence takes the form



where 
 
 
 
  is a real number. For 
 
 
 
 , the complementary non-homogeneous Beatty sequences can be found by making 
 
 
 
  so that


 
  and


 
  form a pair of complementary Beatty sequences.
Examples
For r = the golden mean, we have s = r + 1. In this case, the sequence 
 
 
 
 , known as the lower Wythoff sequence, is

1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 29, ... .

and the complementary sequence 
 
 
 
 , the upper Wythoff sequence, is

2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15, 18, 20, 23, 26, 28, 31, 34, 36, 39, 41, 44, 47, ... .

These sequences define the optimal strategy for Wythoff's game, and are used in the definition of the Wythoff array
As another example, for r = √2, we have s = 2 + √2. In this case, the sequences are

1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, ...  and
3, 6, 10, 13, 17, 20, 23, 27, 30, 34, 37, 40, 44, 47, 51, 54, 58, ... .

And for r = π and s = π/(π - 1) the sequences are

3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 47, 50, 53, ...  and
1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 26, ... .

Notice that any number in the first sequence is lacking in the second, and vice versa.
History
Beatty sequences got their name from the problem posed in the American Mathematical Monthly by Samuel Beatty in 1926.12 It is probably one of the most often cited problems ever posed in the Monthly. However, even earlier, in 1894 such sequences were briefly mentioned by John W. Strutt (3rd Baron Rayleigh) in the second edition of his book The Theory of Sound.3
Rayleigh theorem
The Rayleigh theorem (also known as Beatty's theorem) states that given an irrational number 
 
 
 
  there exists 
 
 
 
  so that the Beatty sequences 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  partition the set of positive integers: each positive integer belongs to exactly one of the two sequences.4
First proof
Given 
 
 
 
  let 
 
 
 
 . We must show that every positive integer lies in one and only one of the two sequences 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . We shall do so by considering the ordinal positions occupied by all the fractions j/r and k/s when they are jointly listed in nondecreasing order for positive integers j and k.
To see that no two of the numbers can occupy the same position (as a single number), suppose to the contrary that 
 
 
 
  for some j and k. Then r/s = j/k, a rational number, but also, 
 
 
 
  not a rational number. Therefore no two of the numbers occupy the same position.
For any j/r, there are j numbers i/r ≤ j/r and 
 
 
 
  numbers 
 
 
 
 , so that the position of 
 
 
 
  in the list is 
 
 
 
 . The equation 
 
 
 
  implies



Likewise, the position of k/s in the list is 
 
 
 
 .
Conclusion: every positive integer (that is, every position in the list) is of the form 
 
 
 
  or of the form 
 
 
 
 , but not both. The converse statement is also true: if p and q are two real numbers such that every positive integer occurs precisely once in the above list, then p and q are irrational and the sum of their reciprocals is 1.
Second proof
Collisions: Suppose that, contrary to the theorem, there are integers j > 0 and k and m such that



This is equivalent to the inequalities



For non-zero j, the irrationality of r and s is incompatible with equality, so



which lead to



Adding these together and using the hypothesis, we get



which is impossible (one cannot have an integer between two adjacent integers). Thus the supposition must be false.
Anti-collisions: Suppose that, contrary to the theorem, there are integers j > 0 and k and m such that



Since j + 1 is non-zero and r and s are irrational, we can exclude equality, so



Then we get



Adding corresponding inequalities, we get






which is also impossible. Thus the supposition is false.

Relation with Sturmian sequences
The first difference


 
  of the Beatty sequence associated to the irrational number 
 
 
 
  is a characteristic Sturmian word over the alphabet 
 
 
 
 .
Generalizations
The Lambek–Moser theorem generalizes the Rayleigh theorem and shows that more general pairs of sequences defined from an integer function and its inverse have the same property of partitioning the integers.
Uspensky's theorem states that, if 
 
 
 
  are positive real numbers such that 
 
 
 
  contains all positive integers exactly once, then 
 
 
 
  That is, there is no equivalent of Rayleigh's theorem to three or more Beatty sequences.56
