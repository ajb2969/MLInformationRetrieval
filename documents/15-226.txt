   Molecular-scale temperature      Molecular-scale temperature   The molecular-scale temperature is the defining property of the U.S. Standard Atmosphere, 1962 . It is defined by the relationship:        T  m    (  z  )    =      M  0    M   (  z  )     ⋅  T    (  z  )           subscript  T  m   z      normal-⋅     subscript  M  0     M  z    T   z     T_{m}(z)=\frac{M_{0}}{M(z)}\cdot{T(z)}      T m (z) is molecular-scale temperature at altitude  z ;  M 0 is molecular weight of air at sea level ;  M(z) is molecular weight of air at altitude z ;  T(z) is absolute temperature at altitude z .
