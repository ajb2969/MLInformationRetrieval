Molecular-scale temperature

The molecular-scale temperature is the defining property of the U.S. Standard Atmosphere, 1962. It is defined by the relationship:




Tm(z) is molecular-scale temperature at altitude z;
 
M0 is molecular weight of air at sea level;
 
M(z) is molecular weight of air at altitude z;
 
T(z) is absolute temperature at altitude z.
