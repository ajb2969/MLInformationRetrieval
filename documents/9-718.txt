   Sz.-Nagy's dilation theorem      Sz.-Nagy's dilation theorem   The Sz.-Nagy dilation theorem (proved by Béla Szőkefalvi-Nagy ) states that every contraction T on a Hilbert space  H has a unitary dilation  U to a Hilbert space K , containing H , with        T  n   =      P  H    U  n    |   H    ,   n  ≥  0.      formulae-sequence     superscript  T  n    evaluated-at     subscript  P  H    superscript  U  n    H      n  0.     T^{n}=P_{H}U^{n}|_{H},\quad n\geq 0.   Moreover, such a dilation is unique (up to unitary equivalence) when one assumes K is minimal, in the sense that the linear span of ∪ n U n K is dense in K . When this minimality condition holds, U is called the minimal unitary dilation of T .  Proof  For a contraction  T (i.e., (     ∥  T  ∥   ≤  1       norm  T   1    \|T\|\leq 1   ), its defect operator  D T is defined to be the (unique) positive square root D T = ( I - T*T ) ½ . In the special case that S is an isometry, the following is an Sz. Nagy unitary dilation of S with the required polynomial functional calculus property:       U  =   [     S     D   S  *        0     -   S  *       ]    .      U    S   subscript  D   superscript  S       0     superscript  S         U=\begin{bmatrix}S&D_{S^{*}}\\
 0&-S^{*}\end{bmatrix}.     Also, every contraction T on a Hilbert space H has an isometric dilation, again with the calculus property, on       ⊕   n  ≥  0    H      subscript  direct-sum    n  0    H    \oplus_{n\geq 0}H     given by       S  =   [     T    0    0    ⋯          D  T     0    0            0    I    0    ⋱      0    0    I    ⋱      ⋮       ⋱    ⋱     ]    .      S    T  0  0  normal-⋯  absent     subscript  D  T   0  0  absent  absent    0  I  0  normal-⋱    0  0  I  normal-⋱    normal-⋮  absent  normal-⋱  normal-⋱      S=\par
 \begin{bmatrix}T&0&0&\cdots&\\
 D_{T}&0&0&&\\
 0&I&0&\ddots\\
 0&0&I&\ddots\\
 \vdots&&\ddots&\ddots\end{bmatrix}.     Applying the above two constructions successively gives a unitary dilation for a contraction T :        T  n   =      P  H    S  n    |   H   =      P  H     (      Q   H  ′    U   |    H  ′    )   n    |   H   =      P  H    U  n    |   H    .         superscript  T  n    evaluated-at     subscript  P  H    superscript  S  n    H         evaluated-at     subscript  P  H    superscript   evaluated-at     subscript  Q   superscript  H  normal-′    U    superscript  H  normal-′    n    H         evaluated-at     subscript  P  H    superscript  U  n    H      T^{n}=P_{H}S^{n}|_{H}=P_{H}(Q_{H^{\prime}}U|_{H^{\prime}})^{n}|_{H}=P_{H}U^{n}%
 |_{H}.     Schaffer form  The Schaffer form of a unitary Sz. Nagy dilation can be viewed as a beginning point for the characterization of all unitary dilations, with the required property, for a given contraction.  Remarks  A generalisation of this theorem, by Berger, Foias and Lebow, shows that if X is a spectral set for T , and      ℛ   (  X  )       ℛ  X    \mathcal{R}(X)     is a Dirichlet algebra , then T has a minimal normal δX dilation, of the form above. A consequence of this is that any operator with a simply connected spectral set X has a minimal normal δX dilation.  To see that this generalises Sz.-Nagy's theorem, note that contraction operators have the unit disc D as a spectral set, and that normal operators with spectrum in the unit circle δ D are unitary.
