Material implication (rule of inference)

In propositional logic, material implication 12 is a valid rule of replacement that allows for a conditional statement to be replaced by a disjunction if and only if the antecedent is negated. The rule states that P implies Q is logically equivalent to not-P or Q and can replace each other in logical proofs.



Where "
 
 
 
 " is a metalogical symbol representing "can be replaced in a proof with."
Formal notation
The material implication rule may be written in sequent notation:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a metalogical symbol meaning that 
 
 
 
  is a syntactic consequence of 
 
 
 
  in some logical system;
or in rule form:


 
  where the rule is that wherever an instance of "
 
 
 
 " appears on a line of a proof, it can be replaced with "
 
 
 
 ";
or as the statement of a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are propositions expressed in some formal system.
Example

If it is a bear, then it can swim.
 
Thus, it is not a bear or it can swim.
 

where 
 
 
 
  is the statement "it is a bear" and 
 
 
 
  is the statement "it can swim".
If it was found that the bear could not swim, written symbolically as 
 
 
 
 , then both sentences are false but otherwise they are both true.
