   Material implication (rule of inference)      Material implication (rule of inference)   In propositional logic , material implication  1 2 is a valid  rule of replacement that allows for a conditional statement to be replaced by a disjunction  if and only if the antecedent is negated . The rule states that P implies Q is logically equivalent to not-P or Q and can replace each other in logical proofs .       P  →  Q   ⇔   ¬  P  Q      normal-⇔   normal-→  P  Q      P  Q     P\to Q\Leftrightarrow\neg PQ     Where "   ⇔   normal-⇔   \Leftrightarrow   " is a metalogical  symbol representing "can be replaced in a proof with."  Formal notation  The material implication rule may be written in sequent notation:       (  P  →  Q  )   ⊢   (  ¬  P  Q  )      fragments   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-→  Q  normal-)   proves   fragments  normal-(   P  Q  normal-)     (P\to Q)\vdash(\neg PQ)   where   ⊢   proves   \vdash   is a metalogical symbol meaning that    (   ¬  P  Q   )       P  Q    (\neg PQ)   is a syntactic consequence of    (   P  →  Q   )     normal-→  P  Q    (P\to Q)   in some logical system;  or in rule form :       P  →  Q    ¬  P  Q        normal-→  P  Q      P  Q     \frac{P\to Q}{\neg PQ}   where the rule is that wherever an instance of "    P  →  Q     normal-→  P  Q    P\to Q   " appears on a line of a proof, it can be replaced with "    ¬  P  Q       P  Q    \neg PQ   ";  or as the statement of a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:       (  P  →  Q  )   →   (  ¬  P  Q  )      fragments   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-→  Q  normal-)   normal-→   fragments  normal-(   P  Q  normal-)     (P\to Q)\to(\neg PQ)     where   P   P   P   and   Q   Q   Q   are propositions expressed in some formal system .  Example   If it is a bear, then it can swim.  Thus, it is not a bear or it can swim.   where   P   P   P   is the statement "it is a bear" and   Q   Q   Q   is the statement "it can swim".  If it was found that the bear could not swim, written symbolically as    P  and  ¬  Q      P  italic- and   Q    P\and\neg Q   , then both sentences are false but otherwise they are both true.
