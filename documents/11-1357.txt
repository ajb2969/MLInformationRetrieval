   Pyridoxine 5'-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase      Pyridoxine 5'-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a pyridoxine 5'-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + pyridoxine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + 5'-O-beta-D-glucosylpyridoxine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and pyridoxine , whereas its two products are UDP and 5'-O-beta-D-glucosylpyridoxine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:pyridoxine 5'-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include UDP-glucose:pyridoxine 5'-O-beta-glucosyltransferase , uridine diphosphoglucose-pyridoxine 5'-beta-glucosyltransferase , and UDP-glucose-pyridoxine glucosyltransferase .
