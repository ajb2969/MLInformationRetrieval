   Ambient isotopy      Ambient isotopy   In the mathematical subject of topology , an ambient isotopy , also called an h-isotopy , is a kind of continuous distortion of an "ambient space", a manifold , taking a submanifold to another submanifold. For example in knot theory , one considers two knots the same if one can distort one knot into the other without breaking it. Such a distortion is an example of an ambient isotopy. More precisely, let N and M be manifolds and g and h be embeddings of N in M . A continuous map      F  :    M  ×   [  0  ,  1  ]    →  M      normal-:  F   normal-→    M   0  1    M     F:M\times[0,1]\rightarrow M   is defined to be an ambient isotopy taking g to h if F 0 is the identity map , each map F t is a homeomorphism from M to itself, and F 1 ∘ g = h . This implies that the orientation must be preserved by ambient isotopies. For example, two knots which are mirror images of each other are in general not equivalent.
