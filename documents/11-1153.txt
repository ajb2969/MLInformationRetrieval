   Darboux's formula      Darboux's formula   In mathematical analysis , Darboux's formula is a formula introduced by  for summing  infinite series by using integrals or evaluating integrals using infinite series. It is a generalization to the complex plane of the Euler–Maclaurin summation formula , which is used for similar purposes and derived in a similar manner (by repeated integration by parts of a particular choice of integrand ). Darboux's formula can also be used to derive the Taylor series of the calculus .  Statement  If φ( t ) is a polynomial of degree n and f an analytic function then        ∑   m  =  0   n       (   -  1   )   m     (   z  -  a   )   m    [     ϕ   (   n  -  m   )     (  1  )    f   (  m  )     (  z  )    -    ϕ   (   n  -  m   )     (  0  )    f   (  m  )     (  a  )     ]        superscript   subscript     m  0    n      superscript    1   m    superscript    z  a   m    delimited-[]       superscript  ϕ    n  m    1   superscript  f  m   z      superscript  ϕ    n  m    0   superscript  f  m   a        \displaystyle\sum_{m=0}^{n}(-1)^{m}(z-a)^{m}\left[\phi^{(n-m)}(1)f^{(m)}(z)-%
 \phi^{(n-m)}(0)f^{(m)}(a)\right]     The formula can be proved by repeated integration by parts.  Special cases  Taking φ to be a Bernoulli polynomial in Darboux's formula gives the Euler–Maclaurin summation formula . Taking φ to be ( t − 1) n gives the formula for a Taylor series .
