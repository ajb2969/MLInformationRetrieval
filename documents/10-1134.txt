   Stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase      Stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase   In enzymology , a stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase () is an enzyme used to produce the monounsaturated  fatty acid  oleic acid from the saturated fatty acid stearic acid . It catalyzes the chemical reaction   stearoyl-CoA + 2 ferrocytochrome b 5 + O 2 + 2 H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   oleoyl-CoA + 2 ferricytochrome b 5 + 2 H 2 O   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are stearoyl-CoA , ferrocytochrome b5 , O 2 , and H + , whereas its 3 products are oleoyl-CoA , ferricytochrome b5 , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 with oxidation of a pair of donors resulting in the reduction of O to two molecules of water. The systematic name of this enzyme class is stearoyl-CoA,ferrocytochrome-b5:oxygen oxidoreductase (9,10-dehydrogenating) . Other names in common use include Delta9-desaturase , acyl-CoA desaturase , fatty acid desaturase , and stearoyl-CoA, hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and ppar signaling pathway . It employs one cofactor , iron .
