   Jacobi operator      Jacobi operator   A Jacobi operator , also known as Jacobi matrix , is a symmetric linear operator acting on sequences which is given by a tridiagonal matrix in the standard basis given by Kronecker deltas . This operator is named after Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi .  Self-adjoint Jacobi operators  The most important case is the one of self-adjoint Jacobi operators acting on the Hilbert space of square summable sequences over the positive integers      ℓ  2    (  ℕ  )        superscript  normal-ℓ  2   ℕ    \ell^{2}(\mathbb{N})   . In this case it is given by          J   f   (  1  )    =    a   (  1  )   f   (  2  )    +   b   (  1  )   f   (  1  )      ,      J   f   (  n  )    =    a   (  n  )   f   (   n  +  1   )    +   a   (   n  -  1   )   f   (   n  -  1   )    +   b   (  n  )   f   (  n  )      ,   n  >  1     ,     formulae-sequence      J  f  1       a  1  f  2     b  1  f  1      formulae-sequence      J  f  n       a  n  f    n  1      a    n  1   f    n  1      b  n  f  n       n  1      J\,f(1)=a(1)f(2)+b(1)f(1),\quad J\,f(n)=a(n)f(n+1)+a(n-1)f(n-1)+b(n)f(n),\quad

 >1,     where the coefficients are assumed to satisfy         a   (  n  )    >  0   ,    b   (  n  )    ∈  ℝ    .     formulae-sequence      a  n   0       b  n   ℝ     a(n)>0,\quad b(n)\in\mathbb{R}.     The operator will be bounded if and only if the coefficients are.  There are close connections with the theory of orthogonal polynomials . In fact, the solution p ( z , n ) of the recurrence relation          J   p   (  z  ,  n  )    =    z   p   (  z  ,  n  )     ,    p   (  z  ,  1  )    =   1  and  p   (  z  ,  0  )    =  0    ,     formulae-sequence      J  p   z  n      z  p   z  n           p   z  1      1  and  p   z  0         0      J\,p(z,n)=z\,p(z,n),\qquad p(z,1)=1\text{ and }p(z,0)=0,     is a polynomial of degree n − 1 and these polynomials are orthonormal with respect to the spectral measure corresponding to the first basis vector      δ  1    (  n  )    =   δ   1  ,  n           subscript  δ  1   n    subscript  δ   1  n      \delta_{1}(n)=\delta_{1,n}   .  Applications  It arises in many areas of mathematics and physics. The case a ( n ) = 1 is known as the discrete one-dimensional Schrödinger operator . It also arises in:   the Lax pair of the Toda lattice .  three-term recurrence relationship of orthogonal polynomials, which is the basis of a set of algorithms devised to calculate Gaussian quadrature rules . 1   References     External links   Jacobi matrix at Encyclopedia of Mathematics   "  Category:Operator theory  Category:Hilbert space  Category:Recurrence relations     Fast variants of the Golub and Welsch algorithm for symmetric weight functions - Gérard Meurant ↩
