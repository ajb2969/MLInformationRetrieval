   23S rRNA (guanine2445-N2)-methyltransferase      23S rRNA (guanine2445-N2)-methyltransferase   23S rRNA (guanine 2445 -N 2 )-methyltransferase (, ycbY (gene) , rlmL (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (guanine 2445 -N 2 )-methyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine 2445 in 23S rRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 2 -methylguanine 2445 in 23S rRNA   The enzyme methylates 23S rRNA  in vitro .
