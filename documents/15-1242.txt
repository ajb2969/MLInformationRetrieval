23S rRNA (guanine2445-N2)-methyltransferase

23S rRNA (guanine2445-N2)-methyltransferase (, ycbY (gene), rlmL (gene)) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (guanine2445-N2)-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine2445 in 23S rRNA 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N2-methylguanine2445 in 23S rRNA
 

The enzyme methylates 23S rRNA in vitro.
