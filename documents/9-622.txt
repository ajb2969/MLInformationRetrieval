Self-diffusion

According to IUPAC definition,1 self-diffusion coefficient is the diffusion coefficient 
 
 
 
  of species 
 
 
 
  when the chemical potential gradient equals zero. It is linked to the diffusion coefficient 
 
 
 
  by the equation:



Here, 
 
 
 
  is the activity of the species 
 
 
 
  in the solution and 
 
 
 
  is the concentration of 
 
 
 
 . This term is commonly assumed to be equal to the tracer diffusion determined by watching the movement of an isotope in the material of interest.
