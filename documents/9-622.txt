   Self-diffusion      Self-diffusion   According to IUPAC definition, 1  self-diffusion coefficient is the diffusion coefficient    D  i  *     superscript   subscript  D  i      D_{i}^{*}   of species   i   i   i   when the chemical potential  gradient equals zero. It is linked to the diffusion coefficient    D  i     subscript  D  i    D_{i}   by the equation:        D  i  *   =    D  i      ∂  ln    c  i      ∂  ln    a  i       .       superscript   subscript  D  i        subscript  D  i           subscript  c  i          subscript  a  i        D_{i}^{*}=D_{i}\frac{\partial\ln c_{i}}{\partial\ln a_{i}}.     Here,    a  i     subscript  a  i    a_{i}   is the activity of the species   i   i   i   in the solution and    c  i     subscript  c  i    c_{i}   is the concentration of   i   i   i   . This term is commonly assumed to be equal to the tracer diffusion determined by watching the movement of an isotope in the material of interest.
