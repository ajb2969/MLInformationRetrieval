   Isoorientin 3'-O-methyltransferase      Isoorientin 3'-O-methyltransferase   In enzymology , an isoorientin 3'-O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + isoorientin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + isoscoparin   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and isoorientin , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and isoscoparin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:isoorientin 3'-O-methyltransferase . This enzyme is also called isoorientin 3'-methyltransferase .
