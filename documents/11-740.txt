   Methylguanidinase      Methylguanidinase   In enzymology , a methylguanidinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   methylguanidine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   methylamine + urea   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are methylguanidine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are methylamine and urea .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is methylguanidine amidinohydrolase . This enzyme is also called methylguanidine hydrolase .
