   Category:Properties of groups      Category:Properties of groups   A group property is something that every group either satisfies or does not satisfy. Group properties must satisfy the condition of isomorphism invariance: if    G  1     subscript  G  1    G_{1}   and    G  2     subscript  G  2    G_{2}   are two isomorphic groups, they either both have the property or both do not have the property.
