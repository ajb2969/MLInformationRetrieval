Fourier sine and cosine series

In mathematics, particularly the field of calculus and Fourier analysis, the Fourier sine and cosine series are two mathematical series named after Joseph Fourier.
Notation
In this article, f denotes a real valued function on 
 
 
 
 .
Sine series
The Fourier sine series of f is defined to be


 
  where


 
 .
If f is continuous and 
 
 
 
 , then the Fourier sine series of f is equal to f on 
 
 
 
 , odd, and periodic with period 
 
 
 
 .
Cosine series
The Fourier cosine series is defined to be


 
  where


 
 .
If f is continuous, then the Fourier cosine series of f is equal to f on 
 
 
 
 , even, and periodic with period 
 
 
 
 .
Remarks
This notion can be generalized to functions which are not continuous.
