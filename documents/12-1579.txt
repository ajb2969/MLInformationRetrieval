   Fourier sine and cosine series      Fourier sine and cosine series   In mathematics, particularly the field of calculus and Fourier analysis , the Fourier sine and cosine series are two mathematical series named after Joseph Fourier .  Notation  In this article, f denotes a real valued function on    [  0  ,  L  ]     0  L    [0,L]   .  Sine series  The Fourier sine series of f is defined to be       ∑   n  =  1   ∞     c  n    sin    n  π  x   L         superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  c  n         n  π  x   L       \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}c_{n}\sin\frac{n\pi x}{L}   where        c  n   =    2  L     ∫  0  L    f   (  x  )    sin      n  π  x   L    d  x        ,   n  ∈  ℕ      formulae-sequence     subscript  c  n       2  L     superscript   subscript   0   L     f  x          n  π  x   L   d  x          n  ℕ     c_{n}=\frac{2}{L}\int_{0}^{L}f(x)\sin\frac{n\pi x}{L}\,dx,n\in\mathbb{N}   .  If f is continuous and     f   (  0  )    =   f   (  L  )    =  0          f  0     f  L        0     f(0)=f(L)=0   , then the Fourier sine series of f is equal to f on    [  0  ,  L  ]     0  L    [0,L]   , odd, and periodic with period    2  L      2  L    2L   .  Cosine series  The Fourier cosine series is defined to be        c  0   2   +    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     c  n    cos    n  π  x   L             subscript  c  0   2     superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  c  n         n  π  x   L        \frac{c_{0}}{2}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}c_{n}\cos\frac{n\pi x}{L}   where        c  n   =    2  L     ∫  0  L    f   (  x  )    cos      n  π  x   L    d  x        ,   n  ∈   ℕ  0       formulae-sequence     subscript  c  n       2  L     superscript   subscript   0   L     f  x          n  π  x   L   d  x          n   subscript  ℕ  0      c_{n}=\frac{2}{L}\int_{0}^{L}f(x)\cos\frac{n\pi x}{L}\,dx,n\in\mathbb{N}_{0}   .  If f is continuous, then the Fourier cosine series of f is equal to f on    [  0  ,  L  ]     0  L    [0,L]   , even, and periodic with period    2  L      2  L    2L   .  Remarks  This notion can be generalized to functions which are not continuous.  See also   Fourier series  Fourier analysis   References  "  Category:Fourier series
