Bargmann–Wigner equations


''This article uses the Einstein summation convention for tensor/spinor indices, and uses hats for quantum operators.
 

In relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, the Bargmann–Wigner equations (or BW equations or BWE) are relativistic wave equations which describe free particles of arbitrary spin

 
 , an integer for bosons (
 
 
 
 ) or half-integer for fermions (
 
 
 
 ). The solutions to the equations are wavefunctions, mathematically in the form of multi-component spinor fields. The spin quantum number is usually denoted by 
 
 
 
  in quantum mechanics, however in this context 
 
 
 
  is more typical in the literature (see references).
They were proposed by Valentine Bargmann and Eugene Wigner in 1948,1 using Lorentz group theory,2 and building on the work of those who pioneered quantum theory within the first half of the twentieth century.34
Origin from the Dirac equation
For reference, the Dirac equation is summarized below. It is the basis for building relativistic wave equations with wavefunctions of higher spin.
The covariant form of the Dirac equation for an uncharged particle is:5
where 
 
 
 
  is a rank-1 4-component spinor field, a function of the particle's position

 
  and time 
 
 
 
 , with components  ψα(r, t)}} in which 
 
 
 
  is a bispinor index that takes values 1, 2, 3, 4. Further,  (γ0, γ)}} are the gamma matrices, and



is the 4-momentum operator. The operator constituting the entire equation,  (−iħγμ∂μ + mc)}}, is a  matrix, because of the  matrices, and the 
 
 
 
  term scalar-multiplies the  identity matrix (usually not written for simplicity). Explicitly, in the Dirac representation of the gamma matrices:6



where  (σ1, σ2, σ3) {{=}} (σx, σy, σz)}} is a vector of the Pauli matrices, E is the energy operator,  (p1, p2, p3) {{=}} (px, py, pz)}} is the 3-momentum operator,  denotes the  identity matrix, the zeros (in the second line) are actually  blocks of zero matrices.
The Dirac equation () can be written as a coupled set of equations:
)\psi_{3,4} |1A}} )\psi_{1,2} |1B}}
where



One 2-component spinor  describes the spin-1/2 fermion, the other  describes the antifermion.
For a charged particle moving in an electromagnetic field, minimal coupling can be introduced:
where 
 
 
 
  is the electric charge of the particle and  (A0, A)}} is the electromagnetic four-potential.
BW equations
For a free particle of spin 
 
 
 
 
 , the BW equations are a set of 
 
 
 
  coupled linear partial differential equations, each with a similar mathematical form to the Dirac equation.
Uncharged massive particles
For a free particle with zero electric charge, the full set of equations are:789



which follow the pattern;
|2}}
for 
 
 
 
 . Again, the operator  is a  matrix. The wavefunction 
 
 
 
 
  has components



and is now a rank-2j 4-component spinor field, usually symmetric in all bispinor indices, but not necessarily; for example, the spin-0 case is antisymmetric. Each index takes the values 1, 2, 3, or 4, so there are  components of the entire spinor field 
 
 
 
 , although a completely symmetric wavefunction reduces the number of independent components to 
 
 
 
 .
Some authors (for example Loide and Saar10) use 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 
  is a non-negative integer (thereby 
 
 
 
  is a half-integer or integer), because this helps remove factors of 2.
The above matrix operator contracts with one bispinor index of 
 
 
 
  at a time (analogous but not equivalent to matrix multiplication), so some properties of the Dirac equation also apply to the BW equations:

the equations are Lorentz covariant,
all components of the solutions 
 
 
 
  also satisfy the Klein–Gordon equation, and hence fulfil the relativistic energy–momentum relation,










second quantization is still possible, but the equations become much more complicated, methods of propagators and S-matrices have been developed, without using a Lagrangian (see below).

The components for a totally symmetric wavefunction are explicitly:11



where the indices are selected so that: .
Unlike the Dirac equation, which can incorporate the electromagnetic field via minimal coupling (), the B–W formalism comprises intrinsic contradictions and difficulties when the electromagnetic field interaction is incorporated. In other words, it is not possible to make the change .1213 An indirect approach to investigate electromagnetic influences of the particle is to derive the electromagnetic four-currents currents and multipole moments for the particle, rather than include the interactions in the wave equations themselves.1415
Coupled equations
Analogous to () and (), the BW equations can be written as a set of coupled equations:
)^{[2j]} \psi_{3,4}^{[2j]} |2A}} )^{[2j]} \psi_{1,2}^{[2j]}  |2B}}
where the notation 
 
 
 
  denotes the 
 
 
induced spinor or matrix (defined in the next section). Each of  and  has 
 
 
 
  independent components.
These can be recombined:16
^2)^{2j}]\begin{pmatrix} \psi_{1,2}^{[2j]} \\ \psi_{3,4}^{[2j]} \end{pmatrix}
= 0
|2C}}
which upon expanding by the binomial theorem, then factorizing;
^2)]\left( (E^2 - (mc^2)^2)^{2j-1} + (E^2 - (mc^2)^2)^{2j-2}\hat{\mathbf{p}}^2 + \cdots (\hat{\mathbf{p}}^2)^{2j-1} \right)\begin{pmatrix} \psi_{1,2}^{[2j]} \\ \psi_{3,4}^{[2j]} \end{pmatrix}
= 0
|2C}}
shows that each component of the BW wavefunction also satisfies the Klein–Gordon equation, uniquely. Conversely, the solutions to the Klein–Gordon equation satisfy the BW equations but are not unique.
Modified gamma matrices
If we define the following Kronecker product (denoted ⊗) of  identity matrices (denoted ), with the  matrix in the 
 
 
 
 
 th place of the product,17



for 
 
 
 
 , these equations () can also be written:
The  matrices have dimension . The equations are linear, so adding () with respect to the 
 
 
 
  values gives:
where the factor of 
 
 
 
  is inserted because the matrix elements 
 
 
 
 
  are added 
 
 
 
  times. Subtracting (), one 
 
 
 
  from the next 
 
 
 
 ; the wavefunction satisfies:
for

Joos-Weinberg equation
Introducing a 
 
 
 
 
  matrix;18



symmetric in any two tensor indices, which generalizes the gamma matrices in the Dirac equation,1920 the BW equation takes the form:2122

This is also known as the Joos-Weinberg equation (or JW or JWE), after H. Joos and Steven Weinberg, found in the early 1960s.2324
Induced matrices
Definition
The induced matrices25 arise from the spinor transformation:
that is:



The 
 
 
 
  induced matrix arises by expanding:



for 
 
 
 
 , simplifying, then writing the set of equations in matrix form.
Properties
Two reasons for introducing the induced matrices is the simple correspondence between induced matrices and powers of eigenvalues, and ease of diagonalization.

Eigenvalues

If 
 
 
 
  is a  matrix, the 2j induced matrix  has eigenvalues  for the same 
 
 
 
  values as above.

Diagonalization

If the transformation  holds, then  will diagonalize .
Use in the BW formalism
In the above equations (), (), (), ():
)^{[2j]} = (i |\hat{\mathbf{p}}|)^{2j}e^{-i\pi\mathbf{J}^{(j)}\cdot\mathbf{n}} |6}}
where matrix indices on the left side are understood to be 
 
 
 
 . The 
 
 
 
  element of the 
 
 
 
  matrix contains the energy–momentum operators and are given by:
)^{[2j]}_{mm'} = (-1)^{m'-m}\sum_{r=-\infty}^\infty\frac{(-1)^rp_{-}^j(-\hat{p}_z)^{j-m'-r}\hat{p}_z^{j+m-r}(-p_{+})^{m'-m+r}}{r!(j-m'-r)!(j+m-r)!(m'-m+r)!}\sqrt{(j+m)!(j-m)!(j+m')!(j-m')!}} |7}}
where 
 
 
 
  is a unit vector and  (J(j)1, J(j)2, J(j)3)}} is the vector of the Pauli matrices for spin s.26
The matrix  has eigenvalues p{{!}}2j}}. The degeneracy of the eigenvalues are as follows:

Lorentz group structure
Under a proper orthochronous Lorentz transformation

 
  in Minkowski space, all one-particle quantum states  of spin 
 
 
 
  with spin z-component 
 
 
 
  locally transform under some representation

 
  of the Lorentz group:2728



where 
 
 
 
  is some finite-dimensional representation, i.e. a matrix. Here 
 
 
 
  is thought of as a column vector containing components with the allowed values of 
 
 
 
 . The quantum numbers

 
  and 
 
 
 
  as well as other labels, continuous or discrete, representing other quantum numbers are suppressed. One value of 
 
 
 
  may occur more than once depending on the representation. Representations with several possible values for 
 
 
 
  are considered below.
The irreducible representations are labeled by a pair of half-integers or integers 
 
 
 
 . From these all other representations can be built up using a variety of standard methods, like taking tensor products and direct sums. In particular, space-time itself constitutes a 4-vector representation 
 
 
 
  so that . To put this into context; Dirac spinors transform under the 
 
 
 
  representation. In general, the 
 
 
 
  representation space has subspaces that under the subgroup of spatial rotations, SO(3), transform irreducibly like objects of spin j, where each allowed value:



occurs exactly once.29 In general, tensor products of irreducible representations are reducible; they decompose as direct sums of irreducible representations.
The representation for the BW equations is the choice:30



where each  is an irreducible representation. This representation does not have definite spin unless 
 
 
 
  equals 1/2 or 0. One may perform a Clebsch–Gordan decomposition to find the irreducible 
 
 
 
  terms and hence the spin content. This redundancy necessitates that a particle of definite spin 
 
 
 
  that transforms under the  representation satisfies field equations.
For the JW equations the choice is:31



This representation has definite spin 
 
 
 
 . It turns out that a spin 
 
 
 
  particle in this representation satisfy field equations too. These equations are very much like the Dirac equations. It is suitable when the symmetries of charge conjugation, time reversal symmetry, and parity are good.
The representations  and  can each separately represent particles of spin 
 
 
 
 . A state or quantum field in such a representation would satisfy no field equation except the Klein-Gordon equation.
Lagrangian
The Lagrangian which generates equations () through the Euler–Lagrange equation (for fields) is not easily found. Methods have been introduced by Guralnik and Kibble, and Larsen and Repko.32
One method proposed by Kamefuchi and Takahashi in 1966 was to expand the wavefunctions in terms of  matrices with a required symmetry (conserved properties of the quantum system), then substitute back into the BW equations to yield field equations with that symmetry. From then a Lagrangian can be found by working backwards from the Euler–Lagrange field equations.
D.S. Kaparulin, S.L. Lyakhovich, and A.A. Sharapov take this fundamental approach by starting from symmetries directly, by means of a Poincaré invariant Lagrange anchor.33 A Lagrange anchor geometrically defines a mapping between fiber bundles, comprising vector bundles, tangent bundles, and the configuration space for the quantum fields. This is less restrictive than a variational formulation (based on the principle of least action) to obtain the equations for the quantum fields.
Formulation in curved spacetime
Following M. Kenmoku,34 in local Minkowski space, the gamma matrices satisfy the anticommutation relations:



where  diag(−1, 1, 1, 1)}} is the Minkowski metric. For the Latin indices here, 
 
 
 
 . In curved spacetime they are similar:



where the spatial gamma matrices are contracted with the vierbein  to obtain  biμ γi}}, and  biμbiν}} is the metric tensor. For the Greek indices; 
 
 
 
 .
A covariant derivative for spinors is given by



with the connection

 
  given in terms of the spin connection

 
  by:



The covariant derivative transforms like 
 
 
 
 :



With this setup, equation () becomes:
