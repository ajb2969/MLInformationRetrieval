   Predicate abstraction      Predicate abstraction   In logic , predicate abstraction is the result of creating a predicate from a sentence . If Q is any formula then the predicate abstract formed from that sentence is (λy.Q), where λ is an abstraction operator and in which every occurrence of y occurs bound by λ in (λy.Q). The resultant predicate (λx.Q(x)) is a monadic predicate capable of taking a term t as argument as in (λx.Q(x))(t), which says that the object denoted by 't' has the property of being such that Q.  The law of abstraction states ( λx.Q(x) )(t) ≡ Q(t/x) where Q(t/x) is the result of replacing all free occurrences of x in Q by t. This law is shown to fail in general in at least two cases: (i) when t is irreferential and (ii) when Q contains modal operators .  In modal logic the " de re / de dicto distinction" is stated as  1. (DE DICTO)    □  A   (  t  )       normal-□  A  t    \Box A(t)     2. (DE RE)     (  λ  x  .  □  A   (  x  )   )    (  t  )      fragments   fragments  normal-(  λ  x  normal-.  □  A   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)   normal-)    fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)     (\lambda x.\Box A(x))(t)   .  In (1) the modal operator applies to the formula A(t) and the term t is within the scope of the modal operator. In (2) t is not within the scope of the modal operator.
