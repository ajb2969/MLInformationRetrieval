It is usually represented by the symbol Q .   Volumetric heat capacity   Volumetric heat capacity (VHC) is the ability of a given volume of a substance to store internal energy while undergoing a given temperature change, but without undergoing a phase transition .   W  Water   Water (H 2 O) in typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or state , but the substance also has a solid state, ice , and a gaseous state, water vapor or steam .   Water gas shift reaction   The water gas shift reaction (WGS) is a chemical reaction in which carbon monoxide reacts with water to form carbon dioxide and hydrogen    Water purification   Water purification is the process of removing contaminants and other harmful microorganisms from a raw water source.   Water vapor   Water vapor or water vapour (see spelling differences ), also aqueous vapor , is the gas phase of water .   Watt   The watt (symbol: W ) is the SI  derived unit of power , equal to one joule of energy per second . It measures a rate of energy use or production.   Wet basis   It is customary to report the product composition data in steam reforming reactions on a steam free basis ( dry basis ) since the steam is not a constituent in any of the synthesis gases produced or in the reformed gas when used as a fuel; 2 however, if steam is to be considered in the product composition data as well, then the calculation would be wet basis .   W/kg   Kilowatts per kilogram (generally, W / kg ).The power per unit of mass in relation to the power-to-weight ratio .   Wt.%   In hydrogen storage research, weight percent (wt.%, also called mass percent ) is the amount of hydrogen stored on a weight basis. This can apply to materials that store hydrogen or for the entire storage system (e.g., material or compressed/liquid hydrogen as well as the tank and other equipment required to contain the hydrogen such as insulation, valves, regulators , etc.). For example, 6 wt.% on a system-basis means that 6% of the entire system by weight is hydrogen. On a material basis, the wt.% is the mass of hydrogen divided by the mass of material plus hydrogen.   X  Y  Yttria-stabilized zirconia   Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is a zirconium-oxide based ceramic   Z  Zinc-air battery   A Zinc-air battery (non-rechargeable), and zinc-air fuel cells , (mechanically-rechargeable) are electro-chemical batteries powered by the oxidation of zinc with oxygen from the air.   Zinc oxide   Zinc oxide is a chemical compound with the formula ZnO.
