   Major seventh chord      Major seventh chord     In music , a major seventh chord is a seventh chord where the " third " note is a major third above the root , and the " seventh " note is a major seventh above the root (a fifth above the third note) . The major seventh chord, sometimes also called a Delta chord , can be written as maj7, M7, , ⑦, 7+, etc. It can be represented by the integer notation {0, 4, 7, 11}. In the case where the seventh note is a minor seventh above the root, it is instead called a dominant seventh chord .  Examples of tonic major seventh chords include Bread 's " Make It With You ", America 's " Tin Man ", Blood Sweat & Tears ' " You've Made Me So Very Happy ", third and main part of Paul McCartney and Wings ' " Band On The Run ", Carly Simon 's " The Right Thing To Do ", Rupert Holmes ' Him and, most famously, Chicago 's " Colour My World ". 1  Moving in the seventies to replace the prominence of the dominant seventh as a stable tonic more common in the first fifteen years of the rock era, the major seventh was common in all styles, "pervading soul , country rock , soft rock , MOR (middle-of-the-road styles), jazz rock , funk , and disco ." 2 "In soul and disco , a tonic minor seventh harmony often alternated with a dominant seventh or dominant ninth chord on    4  ^     normal-^  4    \hat{4}   ['Lady Marmalade' & 'Le Freak']...In other styles, major seventh and minor seventh chords generally mix (usually with eleventh chords ...) to create a diatonic composite in either major or minor mode ....The most famous major seventh chord in the history of music, [is] the one that opens...'Colour My World', even though the song departs from the usual pattern described above by 'colouring' the harmonic succession with several chromatic chords . Still, seven of that song's fourteen chords, including the tonic, are major sevenths or ninths, demonstrating the primacy of that chord type." 3  According to Forte , the major seventh chord is exemplified by IV 7 , which originates melodically. 4  The just major seventh chord is tuned in the ratios 8:10:12:15, as a just major chord is tuned 4:5:6 and a just major seventh is tuned 15:8.
