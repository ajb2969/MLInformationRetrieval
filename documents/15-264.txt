   Partially ordered space      Partially ordered space   In mathematics, a partially ordered space (or pospace ) is a topological space    X   X   X   equipped with a closed partial order    ≤     \leq   , i.e. a partial order whose graph    {    (  x  ,  y  )   ∈   X  2    |   x  ≤  y   }     conditional-set     x  y    superscript  X  2      x  y     \{(x,y)\in X^{2}|x\leq y\}   is a closed subset of    X  2     superscript  X  2    X^{2}   .  From pospaces, one can define dimaps , i.e. continuous maps between pospaces which preserve the order relation.  Equivalences  For a topological space   X   X   X   equipped with a partial order   ≤     \leq   , the following are equivalent:      X   X   X   is a partially ordered space.  For all     x  ,  y   ∈  X       x  y   X    x,y\in X   with    x  ≰  y     not-less-than-or-equals  x  y    x\not\leq y   , there are open sets     U  ,  V   ⊂  X       U  V   X    U,V\subset X   with     x  ∈  U   ,   y  ∈  V      formulae-sequence    x  U     y  V     x\in U,y\in V   and    u  ≰  v     not-less-than-or-equals  u  v    u\not\leq v   for all     u  ∈  U   ,   v  ∈  V      formulae-sequence    u  U     v  V     u\in U,v\in V   .  For all     x  ,  y   ∈  X       x  y   X    x,y\in X   with    x  ≰  y     not-less-than-or-equals  x  y    x\not\leq y   , there are disjoint neighbourhoods   U   U   U   of   x   x   x   and   V   V   V   of   y   y   y   such that   U   U   U   is an upper set and   V   V   V   is a lower set.   The order topology is a special case of this definition, since a total order is also a partial order. Every pospace is a Hausdorff space . If we take equality   =     =   as the partial order, this definition becomes the definition of a Hausdorff space.
