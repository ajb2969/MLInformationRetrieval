Partially ordered space

In mathematics, a partially ordered space (or pospace) is a topological space

 
  equipped with a closed partial order

 
 , i.e. a partial order whose graph 
 
 
 
  is a closed subset of 
 
 
 
 .
From pospaces, one can define dimaps, i.e. continuous maps between pospaces which preserve the order relation.
Equivalences
For a topological space 
 
 
 
  equipped with a partial order 
 
 
 
 , the following are equivalent:



 
  is a partially ordered space.
For all 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , there are open sets 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .
For all 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , there are disjoint neighbourhoods 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is an upper set and 
 
 
 
  is a lower set.

The order topology is a special case of this definition, since a total order is also a partial order. Every pospace is a Hausdorff space. If we take equality 
 
 
 
  as the partial order, this definition becomes the definition of a Hausdorff space.
