Sum rule in quantum mechanics

In quantum mechanics, a sum rule is a formula for transitions between energy levels, in which the sum of the transition strengths is expressed in a simple form. Sum rules are used to describe the properties of many physical systems, including solids, atoms, atomic nuclei, and nuclear constituents such as protons and neutrons.
The sum rules are derived from general principles, and are useful in situations where the behavior of individual energy levels is too complex to be described by a precise quantum-mechanical theory. In general, sum rules are derived by using Heisenberg's quantum-mechanical algebra to construct operator equalities, which are then applied to the particles or energy levels of a system.
Derivation of sum rules1
Assume that the Hamiltonian

 
  has a complete set of eigenfunctions 
 
 
 
  with eigenvalues 
 
 
 
 :


 
  For the Hermitian operator

 
  we define the repeated commutator 
 
 
 
  by:


 
 
  The operator 
 
 
 
  is Hermitian since 
 
 
 
  is defined to be Hermitian. The operator 
 
 
 
  is anti-Hermitian:


 
  By induction one finds:


 
  and also


 
  For a Hermitian operator we have


 
  Using this relation we derive:


 
 
  The result can be written as



For 
 
 
 
  this gives:
