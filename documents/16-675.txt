   Alexandros Chapsiadis      Alexandros Chapsiadis   Dr. Alexandros Chapsiadis (, 1946–1992) was a mathematician and physicist . He was born and raised in Alexandroupolis , Greece .  Academic career  Dr A. Chapsiadis graduated from the Department of Mathematics , Aristotle University of Thessaloniki , Greece , in 1973. In 1975 he received an MSc in Mathematics at the Imperial College London , UK. In 1980 he joined the Technological University of Kavala, Greece , as an Assistant Professor in Mathematics . In 1988 Dr A. Chapsiadis received a PhD in Physics , from the Astrophysics Group, Department of Physics , Aristotle University of Thessaloniki , Greece .  Contribution to Knowledge  In his doctoral Thesis, 1 under the supervision of Prof. M. Michalodimitrakis, he studied the fundamental problem, in Mechanics, of a two–body system consisting of a solid body and a material point. He was the first to prove the existence of bounded motions for an isolated system, consisting of a solid body    B  1     subscript  B  1    B_{1}   and a material point    B  2     subscript  B  2    B_{2}   , moving under their mutual gravitational attraction. Chapsiadis and Michalodimitrakis also found the necessary and sufficient condition for a configuration of the system to be compatible with the given values of the energy   E   E   E   and the angular momentum vector    L  ^     normal-^  L    \hat{L}   (or the    L  2     superscript  L  2    L^{2}   ). They showed that this condition is also valid for a system of    N  ≥  2      N  2    N\geq 2   solids. This fundamental result was published in the Celestial Mechanics Journal. 2  References  Bibliography      "  Category:Greek mathematicians  Category:1946 births  Category:1992 deaths  Category:20th-century mathematicians
