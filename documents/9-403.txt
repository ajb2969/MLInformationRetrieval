   Satellite knot      Satellite knot  In the [[knot theory|mathematical theory of knots]], a '''satellite knot''' is a [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] that contains an [[incompressible surface|incompressible]], non [[boundary-parallel]] [[torus]] in its [[knot complement|complement]]. Colin Adams, ''The Knot Book: An Elem entary Introduction to the Mathematical Theory of Knots , (2001), ISBN 0-7167-4219-5 Every knot is either hyperbolic, a torus, or a satellite knot. The class of satellite knots include composite knots, cable knots and Whitehead doubles. ( See'' Basic families , below for definitions of the last two classes.) A satellite link is one that orbits a companion knot K in the sense that it lies inside a regular neighborhood of the companion. 1  A satellite knot   K   K   K   can be picturesquely described as follows: start by taking a nontrivial knot    K  ′     superscript  K  normal-′    K^{\prime}   lying inside an unknotted solid torus   V   V   V   . Here "nontrivial" means that the knot    K  ′     superscript  K  normal-′    K^{\prime}   is not allowed to sit inside of a 3-ball in   V   V   V   and    K  ′     superscript  K  normal-′    K^{\prime}   is not allowed to be isotopic to the central core curve of the solid torus. Then tie up the solid torus into a nontrivial knot.  This means there is a non-trivial embedding    f  :   V  →   S  3       normal-:  f   normal-→  V   superscript  S  3      f\colon V\to S^{3}   and    K  =   f   (   K  ′   )        K    f   superscript  K  normal-′      K=f(K^{\prime})   . The central core curve of the solid torus   V   V   V   is sent to a knot   H   H   H   , which is called the "companion knot" and is thought of as the planet around which the "satellite knot"   K   K   K   orbits.The construction ensures that    f   (   ∂  V   )       f    V     f(\partial V)   is a non-boundary parallel incompressible torus in the complement of   K   K   K   . Composite knots contain a certain kind of incompressible torus called a swallow-follow torus , which can be visualized as swallowing one summand and following another summand.  Since   V   V   V   is an unknotted solid torus,     S  3   ∖  V       superscript  S  3   V    S^{3}\setminus V   is a tubular neighbourhood of an unknot   J   J   J   . The 2-component link     K  ′   ∪  J       superscript  K  normal-′   J    K^{\prime}\cup J   together with the embedding   f   f   f   is called the pattern associated to the satellite operation.  A convention: people usually demand that the embedding    f  :   V  →   S  3       normal-:  f   normal-→  V   superscript  S  3      f\colon V\to S^{3}   is untwisted in the sense that   f   f   f   must send the standard longitude of   V   V   V   to the standard longitude of    f   (  V  )       f  V    f(V)   . Said another way, given two disjoint curves      c  1   ,   c  2    ⊂  V        subscript  c  1    subscript  c  2    V    c_{1},c_{2}\subset V   ,   f   f   f   must preserve their linking numbers i.e.     l  k   (   f   (   c  1   )    ,   f   (   c  2   )    )    =   l  k   (   c  1   ,   c  2   )          l  k     f   subscript  c  1      f   subscript  c  2        l  k    subscript  c  1    subscript  c  2       lk(f(c_{1}),f(c_{2}))=lk(c_{1},c_{2})   .  Basic families  When     K  ′   ⊂   ∂  V        superscript  K  normal-′     V     K^{\prime}\subset\partial V   is a torus knot , then   K   K   K   is called a cable knot. Examples 3 and 4 are cable knots.  If    K  ′     superscript  K  normal-′    K^{\prime}   is a non-trivial knot in    S  3     superscript  S  3    S^{3}   and if a compressing disc for   V   V   V   intersects    K  ′     superscript  K  normal-′    K^{\prime}   in precisely one point, then   K   K   K   is called a connect-sum. Another way to say this is that the pattern     K  ′   ∪  J       superscript  K  normal-′   J    K^{\prime}\cup J   is the connect-sum of a non-trivial knot    K  ′     superscript  K  normal-′    K^{\prime}   with a Hopf link.  If the link     K  ′   ∪  J       superscript  K  normal-′   J    K^{\prime}\cup J   is the Whitehead link ,   K   K   K   is called a Whitehead double. If   f   f   f   is untwisted,   K   K   K   is called an untwisted Whitehead double.  Examples  Example 1: The connect-sum of a figure-8 knot and trefoil.  Example 2: Untwisted Whitehead double of a figure-8.  Example 3: Cable of a connect-sum.  Example 4: Cable of trefoil.  Examples 5 and 6 are variants on the same construction. They both have two non-parallel, non-boundary-parallel incompressible tori in their complements, splitting the complement into the union of three manifolds. In Example 5 those manifolds are: the Borromean rings complement, trefoil complement and figure-8 complement. In Example 6 the figure-8 complement is replaced by another trefoil complement.    Origins  In 1949 2  Horst Schubert proved that every oriented knot in    S  3     superscript  S  3    S^{3}   decomposes as a connect-sum of prime knots in a unique way, up to reordering, making the monoid of oriented isotopy-classes of knots in    S  3     superscript  S  3    S^{3}   a free commutative monoid on countably-infinite many generators. Shortly after, he realized he could give a new proof of his theorem by a close analysis of the incompressible tori present in the complement of a connect-sum. This led him to study general incompressible tori in knot complements in his epic work Knoten und Vollringe , 3 where he defined satellite and companion knots.  Follow-up work  Schubert's demonstration that incompressible tori play a major role in knot theory was one several early insights leading to the unification of 3-manifold theory and knot theory. It attracted Waldhausen's attention, who later used incompressible surfaces to show that a large class of 3-manifolds are homeomorphic if and only if their fundamental groups are isomorphic. 4 Waldhausen conjectured what is now the Jaco–Shalen–Johannson-decomposition of 3-manifolds, which is a decomposition of 3-manifolds along spheres and incompressible tori. This later became a major ingredient in the development of geometrization , which can be seen as a partial-classification of 3-dimensional manifolds. The ramifications for knot theory were first described in the long-unpublished manuscript of Bonahon and Siebenmann. 5  Uniqueness of satellite decomposition  In Knoten und Vollringe , Schubert proved that in some cases, there is essentially a unique way to express a knot as a satellite. But there are also many known examples where the decomposition is not unique. 6 With a suitably enhanced notion of satellite operation called splicing, the JSJ decomposition gives a proper uniqueness theorem for satellite knots. 7 8  See also   Hyperbolic knot  Torus knot   References    "       ↩  Schubert, H.
