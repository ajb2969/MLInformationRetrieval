Mass point geometry
'''Mass point geometry''', colloquially known as '''mass points''', is a geometry problem-solving technique which applies the physical principle of the [[center of mass]] to geometry problems involving triangles and intersecting [[cevian]]s.Rhoad, R., Milauskas, G., and Whipple, R.  ''Geometry for 
 Enjoyment and Challenge''. McDougal, Littell & Company, 1991. All problems that can be solved using mass point geometry can also be solved using either similar triangles, vectors, or area ratios,1 but mass point geometry is far quicker than those methods2 and thus is used more often on math competitions in which time is an important factor. Though modern mass point geometry was developed in the 1960s by New York high school students,3 the concept has been found to have been used as early as 1827 by August Ferdinand MÃ¶bius in his theory of homogeneous coordinates.4
Definitions
 The theory of mass points is rigorously defined according to the following definitions:5

Mass Point - A mass point is a pair 
 
 
 
 , also written as 
 
 
 
 , including a mass, 
 
 
 
 , and an ordinary point, 
 
 
 
  on a plane.
Coincidence - We say that two points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  coincide if and only if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Addition - The sum of two mass points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  has mass 
 
 
 
  and point 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the point on 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . In other words, 
 
 
 
  is the fulcrum point that perfectly balances the points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . An example of mass point addition is shown at right. Mass point addition is closed, idempotent, commutative, and associative.
Scalar Multiplication - Given a mass point 
 
 
 
  and a positive real scalar 
 
 
 
 , we define multiplication to be 
 
 
 
 . Mass point scalar multiplication is distributive over mass point addition.

Methods
Concurrent cevians
First, a point is assigned with a mass (often a whole number, but it depends on the problem) in the way that other masses are also whole numbers. The principle of calculation is that the foot of a cevian is the addition (defined above) of the two vertices (they are the endpoints of the side where the foot lie). For each cevian, the point of concurrency is the sum of the vertex and the foot. Each length ratio may then be calculated from the masses at the points. See Problem One for an example.
Splitting masses
Splitting masses is the slightly more complicated method necessary when a problem contains transversals in addition to cevians. Any vertex that is on both sides the transversal crosses will have a split mass. A point with a split mass may be treated as a normal mass point, except that it has three masses: one used for each of the two sides it is on, and one that is the sum of the other two split masses and is used for any cevians it may have. See Problem Two for an example.
Other methods

Routh's theorem - Many problems involving triangles with cevians will ask for areas, and mass points does not provide a method for calculating areas. However, Routh's theorem, which goes hand in hand with mass points, uses ratios of lengths to calculate the ratio of areas between a triangle and a triangle formed by three cevians.
Special cevians - When given cevians with special properties, like an angle bisector or an altitude, other theorems may be used alongside mass point geometry that determine length ratios. One very common theorem used likewise is the angle bisector theorem.
Stewart's theorem - When asked not for the ratios of lengths but for the actual lengths themselves, Stewart's theorem may be used to determine the length of the entire segment, and then mass points may be used to determine the ratios and therefore the necessary lengths of parts of segments.
Higher dimensions - The methods involved in mass point geometry are not limited to two dimensions; the same methods may be used in problems involving tetrahedra, or even higher-dimensional shapes, though it is rare that a problem involving four or more dimensions will require use of mass points.

Examples
 
Problem One
Problem. In triangle 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is on 
 
 
 
  so that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is on 
 
 
 
  so that 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  intersect at 
 
 
 
  and line 
 
 
 
  intersects 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 , compute 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Solution. We may arbitrarily assign the mass of point 
 
 
 
  to be 
 
 
 
 . By ratios of lengths, the masses at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  must both be 
 
 
 
 . By summing masses, the masses at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are both 
 
 
 
 . Furthermore, the mass at 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , making the mass at 
 
 
 
  have to be 
 
 
 
  Therefore 
 
 

 
  and 
 
 
 
 . See diagram at right.
Problem Two
Problem. In triangle 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  are on 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , respectively, so that 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  intersect at 
 
 
 
 , compute 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Solution. As this problem involves a transversal, we must use split masses on point 
 
 
 
 . We may arbitrarily assign the mass of point 
 
 
 
  to be 
 
 
 
 . By ratios of lengths, the mass at 
 
 
 
  must be 
 
 
 
  and the mass at 
 
 
 
  is split 
 
 
 
  towards 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  towards 
 
 
 
 . By summing masses, we get the masses at 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  to be 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , respectively. Therefore 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Problem Three
Problem. In triangle 
 
 
 
 , points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are on sides 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively, and points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are on side 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  intersects 
 
 
 
  at point 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  intersects 
 
 
 
  at point 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , compute 
 
 
 
 .
Solution. This problem involves two central intersection points, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , so we must use multiple systems.

System One. For the first system, we will choose 
 
 
 
  as our central point, and we may therefore ignore segment 
 
 
 
  and points 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . We may arbitrarily assign the mass at 
 
 
 
  to be 
 
 
 
 , and by ratios of lengths the masses at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively. By summing masses, we get the masses at 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  to be 10, 9, and 13, respectively. Therefore, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .


System Two. For the second system, we will choose 
 
 
 
  as our central point, and we may therefore ignore segment 
 
 
 
  and points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . As this system involves a transversal, we must use split masses on point 
 
 
 
 . We may arbitrarily assign the mass at 
 
 
 
  to be 
 
 
 
 , and by ratios of lengths, the mass at 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  and the mass at 
 
 
 
  is split 
 
 
 
  towards 
 
 
 
  and 2 towards 
 
 
 
 . By summing masses, we get the masses at 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  to be 4, 6, and 10, respectively. Therefore, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .


Original System. We now know all the ratios necessary to put together the ratio we are asked for. The final answer may be found as follows:
