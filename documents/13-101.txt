   Theorem of Bertini      Theorem of Bertini   In mathematics , the theorem of Bertini is an existence and genericity theorem for smooth connected hyperplane sections for smooth projective varieties over algebraically closed fields , introduced by Eugenio Bertini . This is the simplest and broadest of the "Bertini theorems" applying to a linear system of divisors ; simplest because there is no restriction on the characteristic of the underlying field, while the extensions require characteristic 0. 1 2  Statement for hyperplane sections of smooth varieties  Let X be a smooth quasi-projective variety over an algebraically closed field, embedded in a projective space     𝐏  n     superscript  𝐏  n    \mathbf{P}^{n}   . Let    |  H  |      H    |H|   denote the complete system of hyperplane divisors in    𝐏  n     superscript  𝐏  n    \mathbf{P}^{n}   . Recall that it is the dual space      (   𝐏  n   )   ⋆     superscript   superscript  𝐏  n   normal-⋆    (\mathbf{P}^{n})^{\star}   of    𝐏  n     superscript  𝐏  n    \mathbf{P}^{n}   and is isomorphic to    𝐏  n     superscript  𝐏  n    \mathbf{P}^{n}   .  The theorem of Bertini states that the set of hyperplanes not containing X and with smooth intersection with X contains an open dense subset of the total system of divisors    |  H  |      H    |H|   . The set itself is open if X is projective. If dim( X ) ≥ 2, then these intersections (called hyperplane sections of X ) are connected, hence irreducible.  The theorem hence asserts that a general hyperplane section not equal to X is smooth, that is: the property of smoothness is generic.  Over an arbitrary field k , there is a dense open subset of the dual space     (   𝐏  n   )   ⋆     superscript   superscript  𝐏  n   normal-⋆    (\mathbf{P}^{n})^{\star}   whose rational points define hyperplanes smooth hyperplane sections of X . When k is infinite, this open subset then has infinitely many rational points and there are infinitely many smooth hyperplane sections in X .  Over a finite field, the above open subset may not contain rational points and in general there is no hyperplanes with smooth intersection with X . However, if we take hypersurfaces of sufficientely big degrees, then the theorem of Bertini holds. 3  Outline of a proof  We consider the subfibration of the product variety    X  ×   |  H  |       X    H     X\times|H|   with fiber above    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   the linear system of hyperplanes that intersect X non- transversally at x .  The rank of the fibration in the product is one less than the codimension of    X  ⊂   𝐏  n       X   superscript  𝐏  n     X\subset\mathbf{P}^{n}   , so that the total space has lesser dimension than   n   n   n   and so its projection is contained in a divisor of the complete system    |  H  |      H    |H|   .  General statement  Over   ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   (or an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0), if X is a smooth quasi-projective variety, a general member of a linear system of divisors on X is smooth away from the base locus of the system. This property fails in positive characteristics.  Generalizations  The theorem of Bertini has been generalized in various ways. For example, a result due to Steven Kleiman asserts the following: for a connected algebraic group  G , and any homogeneous G -variety X , and two varieties Y and Z mapping to X , let Y σ be the variety obtained by letting σ ∈ G act on Y . Then, there is an open dense subscheme H of G such that for σ ∈ H ,     Y  σ    ×  X   Z      subscript   X    superscript  Y  σ   Z    Y^{\sigma}\times_{X}Z   is either empty or purely of the (expected) dimension dim Y + dim Z − dim X . If, in addition, Y and Z are smooth , then H may be taken such that     Y  σ    ×  X   Z      subscript   X    superscript  Y  σ   Z    Y^{\sigma}\times_{X}Z   is smooth for all    σ  ∈  H      σ  H    \sigma\in H   , as well. The above theorem of Bertini is the special case where    X  =   ℙ  n       X   superscript  ℙ  n     X=\mathbb{P}^{n}   is expressed as the quotient of SL n by the parabolic subgroup of upper triangular matrices, Z is a subvariety and Y is a hyperplane. 4  Theorem of Bertini has also been generalized to discrete valuation domains or finite fields, or for étale coverings of X .  The theorem is often used for induction steps.  Notes  References    Bertini and his two fundamental theorems by Steven L.
