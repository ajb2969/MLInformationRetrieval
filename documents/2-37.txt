   Residue theorem      Residue theorem   In complex analysis , a field in mathematics, the residue theorem , sometimes called Cauchy's residue theorem (one of many things named after  Augustin-Louis Cauchy ), is a powerful tool to evaluate line integrals of analytic functions over closed curves; it can often be used to compute real integrals as well. It generalizes the Cauchy integral theorem and Cauchy's integral formula . From a geometrical perspective, it is a special case of the generalized Stokes' theorem .  (Figure)  Illustration of the setting.   The statement is as follows:  Suppose U is a simply connected  open subset of the complex plane , and a 1 ,..., a n are finitely many points of U and f is a function which is defined and holomorphic on U \ { a 1 ,..., a n }. If γ is a closed rectifiable curve in U which does not meet any of the a k ,         ∮  γ    f   (  z  )   d  z    =   2  π  i    ∑   k  =  1   n     I   (  γ  ,   a  k   )     Res   (  f  ,   a  k   )        .        subscript  contour-integral  γ     f  z  d  z      2  π  i    superscript   subscript     k  1    n      normal-I  γ   subscript  a  k     Res  f   subscript  a  k         \oint_{\gamma}f(z)\,dz=2\pi i\sum_{k=1}^{n}\operatorname{I}(\gamma,a_{k})%
 \operatorname{Res}(f,a_{k}).     If γ is a positively oriented  simple closed curve , I(γ, a k ) = 1 if a k is in the interior of γ, and 0 if not, so        ∮  γ    f   (  z  )   d  z    =   2  π  i   ∑   Res   (  f  ,   a  k   )            subscript  contour-integral  γ     f  z  d  z      2  π  i     Res  f   subscript  a  k        \oint_{\gamma}f(z)\,dz=2\pi i\sum\operatorname{Res}(f,a_{k})   with the sum over those k for which a k is inside γ.  Here, Res( f , a k ) denotes the residue of f at a k , and I(γ, a k ) is the winding number of the curve γ about the point a k . This winding number is an integer which intuitively measures how many times the curve γ winds around the point a k ; it is positive if γ moves in a counter clockwise ("mathematically positive") manner around a k and 0 if γ doesn't move around a k at all.  The relationship of the residue theorem to Stokes' theorem is given by the Jordan curve theorem . The general plane curve γ must first be reduced to a set of simple closed curves {γ i } whose total is equivalent to γ for integration purposes; this reduces the problem to finding the integral of f  dz along a Jordan curve γ i with interior V . The requirement that f be holomorphic on U 0 = U \ { a k } is equivalent to the statement that the exterior derivative  d ( f  dz ) = 0 on U 0 . Thus if two planar regions V and W of U enclose the same subset { a j } of { a k }, the regions V \ W and W \ V lie entirely in U 0 , and hence      ∫   V  \  W     d   (    f   d  z   )     -    ∫   W  \  V     d   (    f   d  z   )           subscript    normal-\  V  W      d    f  d  z       subscript    normal-\  W  V      d    f  d  z       \scriptstyle\int_{V\backslash W}d(f\,dz)-\int_{W\backslash V}d(f\,dz)   is well-defined and equal to zero. Consequently, the contour integral of f  dz along γ j = ∂V is equal to the sum of a set of integrals along paths λ j , each enclosing an arbitrarily small region around a single a j —the residues of f (up to the conventional factor 2π i ) at { a j }. Summing over {γ j }, we recover the final expression of the contour integral in terms of the winding numbers {I(γ, a k )}.  In order to evaluate real integrals, the residue theorem is used in the following manner: the integrand is extended to the complex plane and its residues are computed (which is usually easy), and a part of the real axis is extended to a closed curve by attaching a half-circle in the upper or lower half-plane, forming a semicircle. The integral over this curve can then be computed using the residue theorem. Often, the half-circle part of the integral will tend towards zero as the radius of the half-circle grows, leaving only the real-axis part of the integral, the one we were originally interested in.  Example  The integral       ∫   -  ∞   ∞       e   i  t  x      x  2   +  1     d  x       superscript   subscript               superscript  e    i  t  x       superscript  x  2   1    d  x     \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{e^{itx}\over x^{2}+1}\,dx     (Figure)  The contour C.   arises in probability theory when calculating the characteristic function of the Cauchy distribution . It resists the techniques of elementary calculus but can be evaluated by expressing it as a limit of contour integrals .  Suppose t > 0 and define the contour C that goes along the real line from − a to a and then counterclockwise along a semicircle centered at 0 from a to − a . Take a to be greater than 1, so that the imaginary unit i is enclosed within the curve. The contour integral is         ∫  C    f   (  z  )   d  z    =    ∫  C       e   i  t  z      z  2   +  1     d  z     .        subscript   C     f  z  d  z      subscript   C        superscript  e    i  t  z       superscript  z  2   1    d  z      \int_{C}{f(z)}\,dz=\int_{C}{e^{itz}\over z^{2}+1}\,dz.     Since e itz is an entire function (having no singularities at any point in the complex plane), this function has singularities only where the denominator z 2 + 1 is zero. Since z 2 + 1 = ( z + i )( z − i ), that happens only where z = i or z = − i . Only one of those points is in the region bounded by this contour. Because f ( z ) is        e   i  t  z      z  2   +  1         superscript  e    i  t  z       superscript  z  2   1     \displaystyle\frac{e^{itz}}{z^{2}+1}     the residue of f ( z ) at z = i is          Res   z  =  i    f    (  z  )    =    e   -  t     2  i     .          subscript  Res    z  i    f   z      superscript  e    t      2  i      \operatorname{Res}\limits_{z=i}f(z)={e^{-t}\over 2i}.     According to the residue theorem, then, we have         ∫  C    f   (  z  )   d  z    =     2  π  i   ⋅    Res   z  =  i    f     (  z  )    =   2  π  i    e   -  t     2  i     =   π   e   -  t      .          subscript   C     f  z  d  z       normal-⋅    2  π  i     subscript  Res    z  i    f    z          2  π  i     superscript  e    t      2  i            π   superscript  e    t        \int_{C}f(z)\,dz=2\pi i\cdot\operatorname{Res}\limits_{z=i}f(z)=2\pi i{e^{-t}%
 \over 2i}=\pi e^{-t}.     The contour C may be split into a "straight" part and a curved arc, so that         ∫  straight    f   (  z  )   d  z    +    ∫  arc    f   (  z  )   d  z     =   π    e   -  t              subscript   straight     f  z  d  z      subscript   arc     f  z  d  z       π   superscript  e    t       \int_{\mathrm{straight}}f(z)\,dz+\int_{\mathrm{arc}}f(z)\,dz=\pi e^{-t}\,     and thus         ∫   -  a   a    f   (  z  )   d  z    =    π   e   -  t     -    ∫  arc    f   (  z  )   d  z      .        superscript   subscript     a    a     f  z  d  z        π   superscript  e    t       subscript   arc     f  z  d  z       \int_{-a}^{a}f(z)\,dz=\pi e^{-t}-\int_{\mathrm{arc}}f(z)\,dz.     Using some estimations , we have        |    ∫  arc       e   i  t  z      z  2   +  1     d  z    |   ≤    ∫  arc     |    e   i  t  z      z  2   +  1    |   d  z    ≤    ∫  arc     1   |    z  2   +  1   |    d  z    ≤    ∫  arc     1    a  2   -  1    d  z    =    π  a     a  2   -  1     .            subscript   arc        superscript  e    i  t  z       superscript  z  2   1    d  z       subscript   arc          superscript  e    i  t  z       superscript  z  2   1     d  z           subscript   arc       1       superscript  z  2   1     d  z           subscript   arc       1     superscript  a  2   1    d  z             π  a      superscript  a  2   1       \left|\int_{\mathrm{arc}}{e^{itz}\over z^{2}+1}\,dz\right|\leq\int_{\mathrm{%
 arc}}\left|{e^{itz}\over z^{2}+1}\right|dz\leq\int_{\mathrm{arc}}{1\over|z^{2}%
 +1|}dz\leq\int_{\mathrm{arc}}{1\over a^{2}-1}dz=\frac{\pi a}{a^{2}-1}.     and        lim   a  →  ∞      π  a     a  2   -  1     =  0.        subscript    normal-→  a         π  a      superscript  a  2   1     0.    \lim_{a\to\infty}\frac{\pi a}{a^{2}-1}=0.     Note that, since t > 0 and for complex numbers in the upper halfplane the argument lies between 0 and π, one can estimate       |   e   i  t  z    |   =   |   e   i  t   |  z  |    (    cos  ϕ   +   i   sin  ϕ     )     |   =   |   e    -   t   |  z  |    sin  ϕ     +   i  t   |  z  |    cos  ϕ      |   =   e   -   t   |  z  |    sin  ϕ      ≤  1.           superscript  e    i  t  z        superscript  e    i  t    z       ϕ     i    ϕ                superscript  e        t    z     ϕ       i  t    z     ϕ             superscript  e      t    z     ϕ           1.     \left|e^{itz}\right|=\left|e^{it|z|(\cos\phi+i\sin\phi)}\right|=\left|e^{-t|z|%
 \sin\phi+it|z|\cos\phi}\right|=e^{-t|z|\sin\phi}\leq 1.     Therefore         ∫   -  ∞   ∞       e   i  t  z      z  2   +  1     d  z    =   π   e   -  t      .        superscript   subscript               superscript  e    i  t  z       superscript  z  2   1    d  z      π   superscript  e    t       \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{e^{itz}\over z^{2}+1}\,dz=\pi e^{-t}.     If t \int_{-\infty}^\infty{e^{itz} \over z^2+1}\,dz=\pi e^t,  and finally we have         ∫   -  ∞   ∞       e   i  t  z      z  2   +  1     d  z    =   π   e   -   |  t  |       .        superscript   subscript               superscript  e    i  t  z       superscript  z  2   1    d  z      π   superscript  e      t        \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{e^{itz}\over z^{2}+1}\,dz=\pi e^{-\left|t\right|}.     (If t = 0 then the integral yields immediately to elementary calculus methods and its value is π.)  Example 2  The fact that    π   cot   (   π  z   )        π   cot    π  z      \pi\operatorname{cot}(\pi z)   has simple poles with residue one at each integer can be used to compute the sum      ∑   -  ∞   ∞     f   (  n  )        superscript   subscript            f  n     \displaystyle\sum_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(n)   .  Consider, for example,     f   (  z  )    =   z   -  2          f  z    superscript  z    2      f(z)=z^{-2}   . Let    Γ  N     subscript  normal-Γ  N    \Gamma_{N}   be the rectangle that is the boundary of     [    -  N   -   1  /  2    ,   N  +   1  /  2    ]   2     superscript       N     1  2      N    1  2     2    [-N-1/2,N+1/2]^{2}   with positive orientation, with an integer N . By the residue formula,        1   2  π  i      ∫   Γ  N     f   (  z  )   π    cot   (   π  z   )     d  z       =    Res   z  =  0    +    ∑    n  =   -  N    ,   n  ≠  0    N    n   -  2              1    2  π  i      subscript    subscript  normal-Γ  N      f  z  π    cot    π  z      d  z          subscript  Res    z  0      superscript   subscript    formulae-sequence    n    N      n  0     N    superscript  n    2        {1\over 2\pi i}\int_{\Gamma_{N}}f(z)\pi\operatorname{cot}(\pi z)\,dz=%
 \operatorname{Res}_{z=0}+\sum_{n=-N,n\neq 0}^{N}n^{-2}   . The left-hand side goes to zero as    N  →  ∞     normal-→  N     N\to\infty   since the integrand has order    O   (   N   -  2    )       O   superscript  N    2      O(N^{-2})   . On the other hand,         z  /  2    cot   (   z  /  2   )     =    1  -    B  2     z  2    2  !      +  ⋯    ,    B  2   =   1  6       formulae-sequence        z  2    cot    z  2         1     subscript  B  2      superscript  z  2     2      normal-⋯       subscript  B  2     1  6      {z/2}\operatorname{cot}(z/2)=1-B_{2}{z^{2}\over 2!}+\cdots,\,B_{2}={1\over 6}   . 1 (In fact,      z  /  2    cot   (   z  /  2   )     =     i  z   /   (   1  -   e   -   i  z      )    -    i  z   /  2            z  2    cot    z  2           i  z     1   superscript  e      i  z           i  z   2      {z/2}\operatorname{cot}(z/2)={iz/(1-e^{-iz}})-iz/2   .) Thus, the residue    Res   z  =  0      subscript  Res    z  0     \operatorname{Res}_{z=0}   at    z  =  0      z  0    z=0   is    -    π  2   /  3          superscript  π  2   3     -{\pi^{2}/3}   . We conclude:        ∑   n  =  1   ∞    1   n  2     =    π  2   6         superscript   subscript     n  1        1   superscript  n  2        superscript  π  2   6     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{1\over n^{2}}={\pi^{2}\over 6}   (cf. Basel problem .)  The same trick can be used to establish       π   cot   (   π  z   )     =    lim   N  →  ∞      ∑   n  =   -  N    N     (   z  -  n   )    -  1            π   cot    π  z       subscript    normal-→  N       superscript   subscript     n    N     N    superscript    z  n     1        \pi\operatorname{cot}(\pi z)=\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{n=-N}^{N}(z-n)^{-1}   (cf. Eisenstein series .) We take     f   (  z  )    =    (   w  -  z   )    -  1          f  z    superscript    w  z     1      f(z)=(w-z)^{-1}   with w a non-integer and we shall show the above for w . The difficulty in this case is to show the vanishing of the contour integral at infinity. We have      ∫   Γ  N        π   cot   (   π  z   )     z    d  z    =  0        subscript    subscript  normal-Γ  N          π   cot    π  z     z   d  z    0    \int_{\Gamma_{N}}{\pi\operatorname{cot}(\pi z)\over z}\,dz=0   since the integrad is an even function and so the contributions from the contour in the left-half plane and the contour in the right cancel each other out. Thus,        ∫   Γ  N     f   (  z  )   π    cot   (   π  z   )     d  z      =    ∫   Γ  N      (    1   w  -  z    +   1  z    )   π    cot   (   π  z   )     d  z            subscript    subscript  normal-Γ  N      f  z  π    cot    π  z      d  z        subscript    subscript  normal-Γ  N          1    w  z      1  z    π    cot    π  z      d  z        \int_{\Gamma_{N}}f(z)\pi\operatorname{cot}(\pi z)\,dz=\int_{\Gamma_{N}}\left({%
 1\over w-z}+{1\over z}\right)\pi\operatorname{cot}(\pi z)\,dz   goes to zero as    N  →  ∞     normal-→  N     N\to\infty   .
