Coomber's relationship

Coomber's relationship can be used to describe how the internal pressure and dielectric constant of a non-polar liquid are related.
As 
 
 
 
 , which defines the internal pressure of a liquid, it can be found that:



where 
 
 
 
  is equal to the number of molecules


 
  is the ionization potential of the liquid


 
  is a temperature dependent relation based on numerical constants of the pair summation from inter-particle geometry


 
  is the polarizability


 
  is the volume of the liquid
where for most non-polar liquids
