Valine—tRNA ligase




Valine—tRNA ligase

In enzymology, a valine-tRNA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + L-valine + tRNAVal 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + L-valyl-tRNAVal
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, L-valine, and tRNA(Val), whereas its 3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and L-valyl-tRNA(Val).
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, to be specific those forming carbon-oxygen bonds in aminoacyl-tRNA and related compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-valine:tRNAVal ligase (AMP-forming). Other names in common use include valyl-tRNA synthetase, valyl-transfer ribonucleate synthetase, valyl-transfer RNA synthetase, valyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase, valine transfer ribonucleate ligase, and valine translase. This enzyme participates in valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis.
