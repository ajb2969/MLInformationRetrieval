   Alkanesulfonate monooxygenase      Alkanesulfonate monooxygenase   In enzymology , an alkanesulfonate monooxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   an alkanesulfonate (R-CH 2 -SO 3 H) + FMNH 2 + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   an aldehyde (R-CHO) + FMN + sulfite + H 2 O   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are alkanesulfonate (R-CH 2 -SO 3 H), FMNH 2 , and O 2 , whereas its 4 products are aldehyde , FMN , sulfite , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 with reduced flavin or flavoprotein as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alkanesulfonate, reduced-FMN:oxygen oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include SsuD , and sulfate starvation-induced protein 6 .
