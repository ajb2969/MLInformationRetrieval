   Syntractrix      Syntractrix   A syntractrix is a curve of the form        x  +     b  2   -   y  2      =   a   ln    b  +     b  2   -   y  2      y      .        x       superscript  b  2    superscript  y  2        a        b       superscript  b  2    superscript  y  2      y       x+\sqrt{b^{2}-y^{2}}=a\ln\frac{b+\sqrt{b^{2}-y^{2}}}{y}.    1   It is the locus of a point on the tangent of a tractrix at a constant distance from the point of tangency, as the point of tangency is moved along the curve. 2  References  "  Category:Curves     George Salmon (1879).
