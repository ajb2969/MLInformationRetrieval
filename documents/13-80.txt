   Pseudoideal      Pseudoideal   In the theory of partially ordered sets , a pseudoideal is a subset characterized by a bounding operator LU.  Basic definitions  LU( A ) is the set of all lower bounds of the set of all upper bounds of the subset A of a partially ordered set .  A subset I of a partially ordered set ( P ,≤) is a Doyle pseudoideal , if the following condition holds:  For every finite subset S of P that has a supremum in P , S    ⊆     \subseteq    I implies that LU( S )   ⊆     \subseteq    I .  A subset I of a partially ordered set ( P ,≤) is a pseudoideal , if the following condition holds:  For every subset S of P having at most two elements that has a supremum in P , S    ⊆     \subseteq    I implies that LU( S )   ⊆     \subseteq    I .  Remarks   Every Frink ideal  I is a Doyle pseudoideal.  A subset I of a lattice ( P ,≤) is a Doyle pseudoideal if and only if it is a lower set that is closed under finite joins ( suprema ).
