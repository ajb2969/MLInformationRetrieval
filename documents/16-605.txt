Rayleigh dissipation function

In physics, the Rayleigh dissipation function, named for Lord Rayleigh, is a function used to handle the effects of velocity-proportional frictional forces in Lagrangian mechanics. It is defined for a system of 
 
 
 
  particles as



The force of friction is negative the velocity gradient of the dissipation function, 
 
 
 
 . The function is half the rate at which energy is being dissipated by the system through friction.
