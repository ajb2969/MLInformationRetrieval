   Amoroso–Robinson relation      Amoroso–Robinson relation   The Amoroso–Robinson relation , named after economists Luigi Amoroso and Joan Robinson , describes the relation between price, marginal revenue , and elasticity of demand .        ∂  R    ∂  x    =   p   (   1  +   1   ϵ   x  ,  p      )            R     x      p    1    1   subscript  ϵ   x  p         \frac{\partial R}{\partial x}=p\left(1+\frac{1}{\epsilon_{x,p}}\right)   ,  where         ∂  R    ∂  x          R     x     \scriptstyle\frac{\partial R}{\partial x}   is the marginal revenue ,     x   x   x   is the particular good ,     p   p   p   is the good's price ,       ϵ   x  ,  p    <  0       subscript  ϵ   x  p    0    \epsilon_{x,p}<0   is the price elasticity of demand .
