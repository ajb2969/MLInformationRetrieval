   Highly accelerated stress test      Highly accelerated stress test   The highly accelerated stress test (HAST) method was invented by Nihal Sinnadurai while working as a Research Engineer at British Telecommunications Research Laboratories in 1968 in order to perform highly accelerated reliability testing of electronics components that are likely to encounter humid environments during normal (ambient) operation. The method uses the principle of a non-saturating autoclave designed and engineered with no moving parts, to deliver close temperature (AF_{H} = e^{(Constant*(RH_{s}^n-RH_{o}^n)}  Where RH s is the stressed humidity, RH o is the operating environment humidity and n is an empirically derived constant (usually 1  Where E a is the activation energy for the temperature induced failure (most often 0.7eV for electronics), k is Boltzmann's Constant , T o is the operating temperature in Kelvin , and T s is the stressed temperature.  Therefore the total acceleration factor for unbiased HAST testing is       A   F   H  A  S  T     =     A   F  H    *  A    F  T    =    e   (  C  o  n  s  t  a  n  t  *   (  R   H  s  n   -  R   H  o  n   )     *   e    (    E  a   /  k   )   *   (    1  /   T  o    -   1  /   T  s     )              A   subscript  F    H  A  S  T           A   subscript  F  H    A    subscript  F  T            superscript  e   fragments  normal-(  C  o  n  s  t  a  n  t    fragments  normal-(  R   superscript   subscript  H  s   n    R   superscript   subscript  H  o   n   normal-)      superscript  e       subscript  E  a   k       1   subscript  T  o      1   subscript  T  s           AF_{HAST}=AF_{H}*AF_{T}=e^{(Constant*(RH_{s}^{n}-RH_{o}^{n})}*e^{(E_{a}/k)*(1/%
