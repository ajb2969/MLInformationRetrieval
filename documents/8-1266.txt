   Impedance of free space      Impedance of free space   The impedance of free space , Z 0 , is a physical constant relating the magnitudes of the electric and magnetic fields of electromagnetic radiation travelling through free space . That is, Z 0 = | E |/| H |, where | E | is the electric field strength and | H | magnetic field strength . It has an exact irrational value, given approximately as 376.73031... ohms . 1  The impedance of free space (more correctly, the wave-impedance of a plane wave  in free space) equals the product of the vacuum permeability or magnetic constant μ 0 and the speed of light in vacuum  c 0 . Since the numerical values of the magnetic constant and of the speed of light are fixed by the definitions of the ampere and the metre respectively, the exact value of the impedance of free space is likewise fixed by definition relative to the S.I. base units.  Terminology  The analogous quantity for a plane wave travelling through a dielectric  medium is called the intrinsic impedance of the medium, and designated η ( eta ). Hence Z 0 is sometimes referred to as the intrinsic impedance of free space , 2 and given the symbol η 0 . 3 It has numerous other synonyms, including:  :* wave impedance of free space , 4  :* the vacuum impedance , 5  :* intrinsic impedance of vacuum , 6  :* characteristic impedance of vacuum , 7  :* wave resistance of free space . 8  Relation to other constants  From the above definition, and the plane wave solution to Maxwell's equations ,       Z  0   =   E  H   =    μ  0    c  0    =     μ  0    ε  0     =   1    ε  0    c  0            subscript  Z  0     E  H           subscript  μ  0    subscript  c  0              subscript  μ  0    subscript  ε  0            1     subscript  ε  0    subscript  c  0        Z_{0}=\frac{E}{H}=\mu_{0}c_{0}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu_{0}}{\varepsilon_{0}}}=\frac{1}%
 {\varepsilon_{0}c_{0}}   where       μ  0   =        subscript  μ  0   absent    \mu_{0}=   the magnetic constant       ε  0   =        subscript  ε  0   absent    \varepsilon_{0}=   the electric constant and       c  0   =        subscript  c  0   absent    c_{0}=   the speed of light in free space . 9 10  The reciprocal of    Z  0     subscript  Z  0    Z_{0}   is sometimes referred to as the admittance of free space , and represented by the symbol    Y  0     subscript  Y  0    Y_{0}   .  Exact value  Since 1948, the SI unit ampere has been defined by choosing the numerical value of μ 0 to be exactly 4 π ×10 −7  H /m. Similarly, since 1983 the SI metre has been defined by choosing the value of c 0 to be 299 792 458 m/s. Consequently       Z  0   =    μ  0    c  0    =    119.9169832    π   Ω          subscript  Z  0      subscript  μ  0    subscript  c  0           119.9169832  π  normal-Ω      Z_{0}=\mu_{0}c_{0}=119.9169832\;\pi\ \Omega    exactly , or       Z  0   ≈   376.730 313 461 77  …  Ω        subscript  Z  0     376.730 313 461 77  normal-…  normal-Ω     Z_{0}\approx 376.730\ 313\ 461\ 77\ldots\Omega   . This situation may change if the ampere is redefined in 2015. See New SI definitions .  120π-approximation  It is very common in textbooks and learned papers written before about 1990 to substitute the approximate value    120  π      120  π    120\pi   for    Z  0     subscript  Z  0    Z_{0}   . This is equivalent to taking the speed of light to be 3×10 8 m/s. For example, Cheng 1989 states 11 that the radiation resistance of a Hertzian dipole is       R  r   ≈   80   π  2     (   ℓ  λ   )   2         subscript  R  r     80   superscript  π  2    superscript    normal-ℓ  λ   2      R_{r}\approx 80\pi^{2}\left(\frac{\ell}{\lambda}\right)^{2}   [ not exact ]  This practice may be recognized from the resulting discrepancy in the units of the given formula. Consideration of the units, or more formally dimensional analysis , may be used to restore the formula to a more exact form—in this case to       R  r   =     2  π   3    Z  0     (   ℓ  λ   )   2         subscript  R  r         2  π   3    subscript  Z  0    superscript    normal-ℓ  λ   2      R_{r}=\frac{2\pi}{3}Z_{0}\left(\frac{\ell}{\lambda}\right)^{2}     See also   Electric constant  Electromagnetic wave equation  Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field  Near and far field  Planck impedance  Sinusoidal plane-wave solutions of the electromagnetic wave equation  Space cloth  Vacuum  Wave impedance   References and notes   12   Further reading     "  Category:Electromagnetism  Category:Physical constants     ↩  ↩   ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  With ISO 31-5 , NIST and the BIPM have adopted the notation c 0 for the speed of light in free space . ↩  "Current practice is to use c 0 to denote the speed of light in vacuum according to ISO 31 .
