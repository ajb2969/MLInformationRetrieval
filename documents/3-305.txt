   Submersion (mathematics)      Submersion (mathematics)   In mathematics , a submersion is a differentiable map between differentiable manifolds whose differential is everywhere surjective . This is a basic concept in differential topology . The notion of a submersion is dual to the notion of an immersion .  Definition  Let M and N be differentiable manifolds and f : M → N be a differentiable map between them. The map f is a submersion at a point  p ∈ M if its differential       D   f  p    :     T  p   M   →    T   f   (  p  )      N        normal-:    D   subscript  f  p     normal-→     subscript  T  p   M      subscript  T    f  p    N      Df_{p}:T_{p}M\to T_{f(p)}N\,     is a surjective  linear map . 1 In this case p is called a regular point of the map f , otherwise, p is a critical point . A point q ∈ N is a regular value of f if all points p in the pre-image f −1 ( q ) are regular points. A differentiable map f that is a submersion at each point is called a submersion . Equivalently, f is a submersion if its differential Df p has constant rank equal to the dimension of N .  A word of warning: some authors use the term "critical point" to describe a point where the rank of the Jacobian matrix of f at p is not maximal. 2 Indeed this is the more useful notion in singularity theory . If the dimension of M is greater than or equal to the dimension of N then these two notions of critical point coincide. But if the dimension of M is less than the dimension of N , all points are critical according to the definition above (the differential cannot be surjective) but the rank of the Jacobian may still be maximal (if it is equal to dim M ). The definition given above is more commonly used, e.g. in the formulation of Sard's theorem .  Examples   Any projection    π  :    ℝ   m  +  n    →   ℝ  n   ⊂   ℝ   m  +  n        normal-:  π     normal-→   superscript  ℝ    m  n     superscript  ℝ  n         superscript  ℝ    m  n        \pi:\mathbb{R}^{m+n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}\subset\mathbb{R}^{m+n}       Local diffeomorphisms    Riemannian submersions    The projection in a smooth vector bundle or a more general smooth fibration . The surjectivity of the differential is a necessary condition for the existence of a local trivialization .   Local normal form  If f : M → N is a submersion at p and f ( p ) = q ∈ N then there exist an open neighborhood  U of p in M , an open neighborhood V of q in N , and local coordinates ( x 1 ,…, x m ) at p and ( x 1 ,…, x n ) at q such that f ( U ) = V and the map f in these local coordinates is the standard projection        f   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   ,   x   n  +  1    ,  …  ,   x  m   )    =   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    .        f    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n    subscript  x    n  1    normal-…   subscript  x  m       subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n      f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n},x_{n+1},\ldots,x_{m})=(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}).     It follows that the full pre-image f −1 ( q ) in M of a regular value q ∈ N under a differentiable map f : M → N is either empty or is a differentiable manifold of dimension dim M − dim N , possibly disconnected. This is the content of the regular value theorem (also known as the submersion theorem ). In particular, the conclusion holds for all q ∈ N if the map f is a submersion.  Topological manifold submersions  Submersions are also well defined for general topological manifolds . 3 A topological manifold submersion is a continuous surjection f : M → N such that for all p ∈ M , for some continuous charts ψ at p and φ at f(p) , the map ψ -1 ∘ f ∘ φ is equal to the projection map from R m to R n , where m =dim( M ) ≥ n =dim( N ).
