Quercetin-3-sulfate 3'-sulfotransferase

In enzymology, a quercetin-3-sulfate 3'-sulfotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + quercetin 3-sulfate 
 
 
 
  adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + quercetin 3,3'-bissulfate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and quercetin 3-sulfate, whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and quercetin 3,3'-bissulfate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:quercetin-3-sulfate 3'-sulfotransferase. Other names in common use include flavonol 3'-sulfotransferase, 3'-Sulfotransferase, and PAPS:flavonol 3-sulfate 3'-sulfotransferase.
