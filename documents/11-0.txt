Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase

In enzymology, a phosphatidylserine decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

phosphatidyl-L-serine 
 
 
 
  phosphatidylethanolamine + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, phosphatidyl-L-serine, and two products, phosphatidylethanolamine and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phosphatidyl-L-serine carboxy-lyase (phosphatidylethanolamine-forming). Other names in common use include PS decarboxylase, and phosphatidyl-L-serine carboxy-lyase. This enzyme participates in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism. It has 2 cofactors: pyridoxal phosphate, and Pyruvate.
