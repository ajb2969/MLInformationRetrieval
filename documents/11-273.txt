CDP-diacylglycerol diphosphatase




CDP-diacylglycerol diphosphatase

In enzymology, a CDP-diacylglycerol diphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

CDP-diacylglycerol + H2O 
 
 
 
  CMP + phosphatidate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CDP-diacylglycerol and H2O, whereas its two products are CMP and phosphatidate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is CDP-diacylglycerol phosphatidylhydrolase. Other names in common use include cytidine diphosphodiacylglycerol pyrophosphatase, and CDP diacylglycerol hydrolase. This enzyme participates in glycerophospholipid metabolism.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
