   Mimic function      Mimic function   A mimic function changes a file   A   A   A   so it assumes the statistical properties of another file   B   B   B   . That is, if    p   (  t  ,  A  )       p   t  A     p(t,A)   is the probability of some substring   t   t   t   occurring in   A   A   A   , then a mimic function   f   f   f   , recodes   A   A   A   so that    p   (  t  ,   f   (  A  )    )       p   t    f  A      p(t,f(A))   approximates    p   (  t  ,  B  )       p   t  B     p(t,B)   for all strings   t   t   t   of length less than some   n   n   n   . It is commonly considered to be one of the basic techniques for hiding information , often called steganography .  The simplest mimic functions use simple statistical models to pick the symbols in the output. If the statistical model says that item   x   x   x   occurs with probability     p   (  x  ,  A  )       p   x  A     p(x,A)   and item   y   y   y   occurs with probability    p   (  y  ,  A  )       p   y  A     p(y,A)   , then a random number is used to choose between outputting   x   x   x   or   y   y   y   with probability    p   (  x  ,  A  )       p   x  A     p(x,A)   or    p   (  y  ,  A  )       p   y  A     p(y,A)   respectively.  More sophisticated mimic functions use grammar-based models of   B   B   B   to structure the output. One example, "SpamMimic" , uses a context free grammar to model the structure of a typical spam email message. It will convert the input file A to read like a spam message.  Even more sophisticated models use reversible Turing machines .  References   Peter Wayner. "Mimic Functions"  Peter Wayner.
