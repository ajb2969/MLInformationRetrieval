Mimic function

A mimic function changes a file 
 
 
 
  so it assumes the statistical properties of another file 
 
 
 
 . That is, if 
 
 
 
  is the probability of some substring 
 
 
 
  occurring in 
 
 
 
 , then a mimic function 
 
 
 
 , recodes 
 
 
 
  so that 
 
 
 
  approximates 
 
 
 
  for all strings 
 
 
 
  of length less than some 
 
 
 
 . It is commonly considered to be one of the basic techniques for hiding information, often called steganography.
The simplest mimic functions use simple statistical models to pick the symbols in the output. If the statistical model says that item 
 
 
 
  occurs with probability

 
  and item 
 
 
 
  occurs with probability 
 
 
 
 , then a random number is used to choose between outputting 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  with probability 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  respectively.
More sophisticated mimic functions use grammar-based models of 
 
 
 
  to structure the output. One example, "SpamMimic", uses a context free grammar to model the structure of a typical spam email message. It will convert the input file A to read like a spam message.
Even more sophisticated models use reversible Turing machines.
