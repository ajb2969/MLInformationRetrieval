   Noether normalization lemma      Noether normalization lemma   In mathematics , the Noether normalization lemma is a result of commutative algebra , introduced by Emmy Noether in 1926. 1 A simple version states that for any field  k , and any finitely generated commutative k -algebra  A , there exists a nonnegative integer d and algebraically independent elements y 1 , y 2 , ..., y d in A such that A is a finitely generated module over the polynomial ring S := k [ y 1 , y 2 , ..., y d ].  The integer d is uniquely determined; it is the Krull dimension of the ring A . When A is an integral domain , d is also the transcendence degree of the field of fractions of A over k .  The theorem has a geometric interpretation. Suppose A is integral. Let S be the coordinate ring of the d -dimensional affine space     𝔸  k  d     subscript   superscript  𝔸  d   k    \mathbb{A}^{d}_{k}   , and A as the coordinate ring of some other d -dimensional affine variety  X . Then the inclusion map  S → A induces a surjective finite morphism of affine varieties     X  →   𝔸  k  d      normal-→  X   subscript   superscript  𝔸  d   k     X\to\mathbb{A}^{d}_{k}   . The conclusion is that any affine variety is a branched covering of affine space. When k is infinite, such a branched covering map can be constructed by taking a general projection from an affine space containing X to a d -dimensional subspace.  More generally, in the language of schemes, the theorem can equivalently be stated as follows: every affine k -scheme (of finite type) X is finite over an affine n -dimensional space. The theorem can be refined to include a chain of ideals of R (equivalently, closed subsets of X ) that are finite over the affine coordinate subspaces of the appropriate dimensions. 2  The form of the Noether normalization lemma stated above can be used as an important step in proving Hilbert's Nullstellensatz . This gives it further geometric importance, at least formally, as the Nullstellensatz underlies the development of much of classical algebraic geometry . The theorem is also an important tool in establishing the notions of Krull dimension for k -algebras.  Proof  The following proof is due to Nagata and is taken from Mumford's red book. A proof in the geometric flavor is also given in the page 127 of the red book and this mathoverflow thread .  The ring A in the lemma is generated as k -algebra by elements, say,     y  1   ,  …  ,   y  m       subscript  y  1   normal-…   subscript  y  m     y_{1},...,y_{m}   such that     y  1   ,  …  ,   y  d       subscript  y  1   normal-…   subscript  y  d     y_{1},...,y_{d}   (some d ) are algebraically independent over k and the rest are algebraic over    k   [   y  1   ,  …  ,   y  d   ]       k    subscript  y  1   normal-…   subscript  y  d      k[y_{1},...,y_{d}]   . 3 We shall induct on m . If    m  =  d      m  d    m=d   , then the assertion is trivial. Assume now    m  >  d      m  d    m>d   . It is enough to show that there is a subring S of A that is generated by    m  -  1      m  1    m-1   elements and is such that A is finite over S , for, by inductive hypothesis, we can find algebraically independent elements     x  1   ,  …  ,   x  d       subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  d     x_{1},...,x_{d}   of S such that S is finite over    k   [   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  d   ]       k    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  d      k[x_{1},...,x_{d}]   . Since    m  >  d      m  d    m>d   , there is a nonzero polynomial f in m variables over k such that       f   (   y  1   ,  …  ,   y  m   )    =  0        f    subscript  y  1   normal-…   subscript  y  m     0    f(y_{1},...,y_{m})=0   . Given an integer r which is determined later, set         z  i   =    y  i   -   y  1   r   i  -  1       ,   2  ≤  i  ≤  m    .     formulae-sequence     subscript  z  i      subscript  y  i    superscript   subscript  y  1    superscript  r    i  1           2  i       m      z_{i}=y_{i}-y_{1}^{r^{i-1}},\quad 2\leq i\leq m.   Then the preceding reads:       f   (   y  1   ,    z  2   +   y  1  r    ,    z  3   +   y  1   r  2     ,  …  ,    z  m   +   y  1   r   m  -  1      )    =  0        f    subscript  y  1      subscript  z  2    superscript   subscript  y  1   r       subscript  z  3    superscript   subscript  y  1    superscript  r  2     normal-…     subscript  z  m    superscript   subscript  y  1    superscript  r    m  1        0    f(y_{1},z_{2}+y_{1}^{r},z_{3}+y_{1}^{r^{2}},...,z_{m}+y_{1}^{r^{m-1}})=0   . Now, the highest term in    y  1     subscript  y  1    y_{1}   of       a   y  1   α  1      ∏  2  m     (    z  i   +   y  1   r   i  -  1      )    α  i      ,  a   ∈  k   ,         a   superscript   subscript  y  1    subscript  α  1      superscript   subscript  product  2   m    superscript     subscript  z  i    superscript   subscript  y  1    superscript  r    i  1       subscript  α  i      a   k    ay_{1}^{\alpha_{1}}\prod_{2}^{m}(z_{i}+y_{1}^{r^{i-1}})^{\alpha_{i}},a\in k,   looks       a   y  1    α  1   +   r   α  2    +  …  +    α  m    r   m  -  1        .      a   superscript   subscript  y  1      subscript  α  1     r   subscript  α  2    normal-…     subscript  α  m    superscript  r    m  1         ay_{1}^{\alpha_{1}+r\alpha_{2}+...+\alpha_{m}r^{m-1}}.   Thus, if r is larger than any exponent    α  i     subscript  α  i    \alpha_{i}   appearing in f , then the highest term of    f   (   y  1   ,    z  2   +   y  1  r    ,    z  3   +   y  1   r  2     ,  …  ,    z  m   +   y  1   r   m  -  1      )       f    subscript  y  1      subscript  z  2    superscript   subscript  y  1   r       subscript  z  3    superscript   subscript  y  1    superscript  r  2     normal-…     subscript  z  m    superscript   subscript  y  1    superscript  r    m  1         f(y_{1},z_{2}+y_{1}^{r},z_{3}+y_{1}^{r^{2}},...,z_{m}+y_{1}^{r^{m-1}})   in    y  1     subscript  y  1    y_{1}   also has the form as above. In other words,    y  1     subscript  y  1    y_{1}   is integral over    S  =   k   [   z  2   ,  …  ,   z  m   ]        S    k    subscript  z  2   normal-…   subscript  z  m       S=k[z_{2},...,z_{m}]   . Since     y  i   =    z  i   +   y  1   r   i  -  1           subscript  y  i      subscript  z  i    superscript   subscript  y  1    superscript  r    i  1        y_{i}=z_{i}+y_{1}^{r^{i-1}}   are also integral over that ring, A is integral over S . It follows A is finite over S .  If A is an integral domain, then d is the transcendence degree of its field of fractions. Indeed, A and    S  =   k   [   y  1   ,  …  ,   y  d   ]        S    k    subscript  y  1   normal-…   subscript  y  d       S=k[y_{1},...,y_{d}]   have the same transcendence degree (i.e., the degree of the field of fractions) since the field of fractions of A is algebraic over that of S (as A is integral over S ) and S obviously has transcendence degree d . Thus, it remains to show the Krull dimension of the polynomial ring S is d . (this is also a consequence of dimension theory .) We induct on d ,    d  =  0      d  0    d=0   being trivial. Since    0  ⊊   (   y  1   )   ⊊   (   y  1   ,   y  2   )   ⊊  ⋯  ⊊   (   y  1   ,  …  ,   y  d   )         0   subscript  y  1          subscript  y  1    subscript  y  2         normal-⋯         subscript  y  1   normal-…   subscript  y  d       0\subsetneq(y_{1})\subsetneq(y_{1},y_{2})\subsetneq\cdots\subsetneq(y_{1},%
 \dots,y_{d})   is a chain of prime ideals, the dimension is at least d . To get the reverse estimate, let    0  ⊊   𝔭  1   ⊊  ⋯  ⊊   𝔭  m         0   subscript  𝔭  1        normal-⋯        subscript  𝔭  m      0\subsetneq\mathfrak{p}_{1}\subsetneq\cdots\subsetneq\mathfrak{p}_{m}   be a chain of prime ideals. Let    0  ≠  u  ∈   𝔭  1         0  u        subscript  𝔭  1      0\neq u\in\mathfrak{p}_{1}   . We apply the noether normalization and get    T  =   k   [  u  ,   z  2   ,  …  ,   z  d   ]        T    k   u   subscript  z  2   normal-…   subscript  z  d       T=k[u,z_{2},\dots,z_{d}]   (in the normalization process, we're free to choose the first variable) such that S is integral over T . By inductive hypothesis,    T  /   (  u  )       T  u    T/(u)   has dimension d - 1. By incomparability ,     𝔭  i   ∩  T       subscript  𝔭  i   T    \mathfrak{p}_{i}\cap T   is a chain of length   m   m   m   and then, in    T  /   (    𝔭  1   ∩  T   )       T     subscript  𝔭  1   T     T/(\mathfrak{p}_{1}\cap T)   , it becomes a chain of length    m  -  1      m  1    m-1   . Since      dim  T   /   (    𝔭  1   ∩  T   )    ≤    dim  T   /   (  u  )           dim  T      subscript  𝔭  1   T       dim  T   u     \operatorname{dim}T/(\mathfrak{p}_{1}\cap T)\leq\operatorname{dim}T/(u)   , we have     m  -  1   ≤   d  -  1         m  1     d  1     m-1\leq d-1   . Hence,     dim  S   ≤  d       dimension  S   d    \dim S\leq d   .  Refinement  The following refinement appears in Eisenbud's book, which builds on Nagata's idea: 4   Geometrically speaking, the last part of the theorem says that for    X  =   Spec  A   ⊂   𝐀  m         X   Spec  A         superscript  𝐀  m      X=\operatorname{Spec}A\subset\mathbf{A}^{m}   any general linear projection     𝐀  m   →   𝐀  d      normal-→   superscript  𝐀  m    superscript  𝐀  d     \mathbf{A}^{m}\to\mathbf{A}^{d}   induces a finite morphism     X  →   𝐀  d      normal-→  X   superscript  𝐀  d     X\to\mathbf{A}^{d}   (cf. the lede); besides Eisenbud, see also 1 .
