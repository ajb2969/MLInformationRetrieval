Polygalacturonate 4-alpha-galacturonosyltransferase




Polygalacturonate 4-alpha-galacturonosyltransferase

In enzymology, a polygalacturonate 4-alpha-galacturonosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-D-galacturonate + (1,4-alpha-D-galacturonosyl)n 
 
 
 
  UDP + (1,4-alpha-D-galacturonosyl)n+1
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-D-galacturonate and (1,4-alpha-D-galacturonosyl)n, whereas its two products are UDP and (1,4-alpha-D-galacturonosyl)n+1.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-D-galacturonate:1,4-alpha-poly-D-galacturonate 4-alpha-D-galacturonosyltransferase. Other names in common use include UDP galacturonate-polygalacturonate alpha-galacturonosyltransferase, uridine diphosphogalacturonate-polygalacturonate, and alpha-galacturonosyltransferase. This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism and nucleotide sugars metabolism.
Indications
Polygalacturonate salts can be used clinically to treat the GI reactions that are due to Quinidine.
