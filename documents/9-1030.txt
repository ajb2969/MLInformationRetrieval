   Lagrange multipliers on Banach spaces      Lagrange multipliers on Banach spaces   In the field of calculus of variations in mathematics , the method of Lagrange multipliers on Banach spaces can be used to solve certain infinite-dimensional constrained  optimization problems . The method is a generalization of the classical method of Lagrange multipliers as used to find extrema of a function of finitely many variables.  The Lagrange multiplier theorem for Banach spaces  Let X and Y be real  Banach spaces . Let U be an open subset of X and let f : U → R be a continuously differentiable function . Let g : U → Y be another continuously differentiable function, the constraint : the objective is to find the extremal points (maxima or minima) of f subject to the constraint that g is zero.  Suppose that u 0 is a constrained extremum of f , i.e. an extremum of f on         g   -  1     (  0  )    =   {   x  ∈  U   ∣    g   (  x  )    =  0  ∈  Y   }   ⊆  U   .           superscript  g    1    0    conditional-set    x  U         g  x   0       Y          U     g^{-1}(0)=\{x\in U\mid g(x)=0\in Y\}\subseteq U.     Suppose also that the Fréchet derivative D g ( u 0 ) : X → Y of g at u 0 is a surjective  linear map . Then there exists a Lagrange multiplier  λ : Y → R in Y ∗ , the dual space to Y , such that      D  f   (   u  0   )   =  λ  ∘  D  g   (   u  0   )   .  (L)     fragments  D  f   fragments  normal-(   subscript  u  0   normal-)    λ   D  g   fragments  normal-(   subscript  u  0   normal-)   normal-.   (L)    \mathrm{D}f(u_{0})=\lambda\circ\mathrm{D}g(u_{0}).\quad\mbox{(L)}     Since D f ( u 0 ) is an element of the dual space X ∗ , equation (L) can also be written as        D  f   (   u  0   )    =     (   D  g   (   u  0   )    )   *    (  λ  )     ,        normal-D  f   subscript  u  0       superscript    normal-D  g   subscript  u  0      λ     \mathrm{D}f(u_{0})=\left(\mathrm{D}g(u_{0})\right)^{*}(\lambda),     where (D g ( u 0 )) ∗ ( λ ) is the pullback of λ by D g ( u 0 ), i.e. the action of the adjoint map (D g ( u 0 )) ∗ on λ , as defined by          (   D  g   (   u  0   )    )   *    (  λ  )    =    λ  ∘  D   g   (   u  0   )     .         superscript    normal-D  g   subscript  u  0      λ       λ  normal-D   g   subscript  u  0      \left(\mathrm{D}g(u_{0})\right)^{*}(\lambda)=\lambda\circ\mathrm{D}g(u_{0}).     Connection to the finite-dimensional case  In the case that X and Y are both finite-dimensional (i.e. linearly isomorphic to R m and R n for some natural numbers  m and n ) then writing out equation (L) in matrix form shows that λ is the usual Lagrange multiplier vector; in the case n = 1, λ is the usual Lagrange multiplier, a real number.  Application  In many optimization problems, one seeks to minimize a functional defined on an infinite-dimensional space such as a Banach space.  Consider, for example, the Sobolev space  X = H 0 1 ([−1, +1]; R ) and the functional f : X → R given by        f   (  u  )    =    ∫   -  1    +  1      u  ′      (  x  )   2    d  x     .        f  u     superscript   subscript     1      1       superscript  u  normal-′    superscript  x  2   normal-d  x      f(u)=\int_{-1}^{+1}u^{\prime}(x)^{2}\,\mathrm{d}x.     Without any constraint, the minimum value of f would be 0, attained by u 0 ( x ) = 0 for all x between −1 and +1. One could also consider the constrained optimization problem, to minimize f among all those u ∈ X such that the mean value of u is +1. In terms of the above theorem, the constraint g would be given by       g   (  u  )    =     1  2     ∫   -  1    +  1     u   (  x  )   d  x     -  1.         g  u         1  2     superscript   subscript     1      1      u  x  normal-d  x     1.     g(u)=\frac{1}{2}\int_{-1}^{+1}u(x)\,\mathrm{d}x-1.     However this problem can be solved as in the finite dimensional case since the Lagrange multiplier   λ   λ   \lambda   is only a scalar.
