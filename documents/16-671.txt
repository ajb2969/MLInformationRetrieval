   Gromov boundary      Gromov boundary   (Figure)  The Cayley graph of a free group with two generators. This is a hyperbolic group whose Gromov boundary is a Cantor set . Hyperbolic groups and their boundaries are important topics in geometric group theory , as are Cayley graphs.   (Figure)  The (6,4,2) triangular hyperbolic tiling. The triangle group corresponding to this tiling has a circle as its Gromov boundary.   In mathematics, the Gromov boundary of a δ-hyperbolic space (especially a hyperbolic group ) is an abstract concept generalizing the boundary sphere of hyperbolic space . Conceptually, the Gromov boundary is the set of all points at infinity . For instance, the Gromov boundary of the real line is two points, corresponding to positive and negative infinity.  Definition  There are several equivalent definitions of the Gromov boundary. One of the most common uses equivalence classes of geodesic rays. 1  Pick some point   O   O   O   of a hyperbolic metric space   X   X   X   to be the origin. A geodesic ray is a path given by an isometry     γ  :    [  0  ,  ∞  )   →  X      normal-:  γ   normal-→   0    X     \gamma:[0,\infty)\rightarrow X   such that each segment    γ   (   [  0  ,  t  ]   )       γ   0  t     \gamma([0,t])   is a path of shortest length from   O   O   O   to    γ   (  t  )       γ  t    \gamma(t)   .  We say that two geodesics     γ  1   ,   γ  2       subscript  γ  1    subscript  γ  2     \gamma_{1},\gamma_{2}   are equivalent if there is a constant   K   K   K   such that     d   (    γ  1    (  t  )    ,    γ  2    (  t  )    )    ≤  K        d      subscript  γ  1   t      subscript  γ  2   t     K    d(\gamma_{1}(t),\gamma_{2}(t))\leq K   for all   t   t   t   . The equivalence class of   γ   γ   \gamma   is denoted    [  γ  ]     delimited-[]  γ    [\gamma]   .  The Gromov boundary of a hyperbolic metric space   X   X   X   is the set    ∂  X  =   {   [  γ  ]   |  γ      fragments   X    fragments  normal-{   fragments  normal-[  γ  normal-]   normal-|  γ     \partial X=\{[\gamma]|\gamma   is a geodesic ray in    X  }     fragments  X  normal-}    X\}   .  Topology  It is useful to use the Gromov product of three points. The Gromov product of three points    x  ,  y  ,  z     x  y  z    x,y,z   in a metric space is      (  x  ,  y  )   z   =    1  /  2    (     d   (  x  ,  z  )    +   d   (  y  ,  z  )     -   d   (  x  ,  y  )     )         subscript   x  y   z       1  2         d   x  z      d   y  z       d   x  y        (x,y)_{z}=1/2(d(x,z)+d(y,z)-d(x,y))   . In a tree (graph theory) , this measures how long the paths from   z   z   z   to   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   stay together before diverging. Since hyperbolic spaces are tree-like, the Gromov product measures how long geodesics from   z   z   z   to   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   stay close before diverging.  Given a point   p   p   p   in the Gromov boundary, we define the sets    V   (  p  ,  r  )   =   {  q  ∈  ∂  X  |      fragments  V   fragments  normal-(  p  normal-,  r  normal-)     fragments  normal-{  q    X  normal-|     V(p,r)=\{q\in\partial X|   there are geodesic rays     γ  1   ,   γ  2       subscript  γ  1    subscript  γ  2     \gamma_{1},\gamma_{2}   with      [   γ  1   ]   =  p   ,    [   γ  2   ]   =  q      formulae-sequence     delimited-[]   subscript  γ  1    p      delimited-[]   subscript  γ  2    q     [\gamma_{1}]=p,[\gamma_{2}]=q   and    lim   inf    s  ,  t   →  ∞      (   γ  1    (  s  )   ,   γ  2    (  t  )   )   O   ≥  r  }     fragments    subscript  infimum   normal-→   s  t       subscript   fragments  normal-(   subscript  γ  1    fragments  normal-(  s  normal-)   normal-,   subscript  γ  2    fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)   normal-)   O    r  normal-}    \lim\inf_{s,t\rightarrow\infty}(\gamma_{1}(s),\gamma_{2}(t))_{O}\geq r\}   . These open sets form a basis for the topology of the Gromov boundary.  These open sets are just the set of geodesic rays which follow one fixed geodesic ray up to a distance   r   r   r   before diverging.  This topology makes the Gromov boundary into a compact  metrizable space.  The number of ends of a hyperbolic group is the number of components of the Gromov boundary.  Properties of the Gromov boundary  The Gromov boundary has several important properties. One of the most frequently used properties in group theory is the following: if a group   G   G   G    acts geometrically on a δ-hyperbolic space , then   G   G   G   is hyperbolic group and   G   G   G   and   X   X   X   have homeomorphic Gromov boundaries. 2  One of the most important properties is that it is a quasi-isometry invariant; that is, if two hyperbolic metric spaces are quasi-isometric, then the quasi-isometry between them gives a homeomorphism between their boundaries homeomorphic. 3 4 This is important because homeomorphisms of compact spaces are much easier to understand than quasi-isometries of spaces.  Examples   The Gromov boundary of a tree is a Cantor set .  The Gromov boundary of hyperbolic n-space is an (n-1) -dimensional sphere .  The Gromov boundary of most hyperbolic groups is a Menger sponge  5   Generalizations  Visual boundary of CAT(0) space  Cannon's Conjecture  Cannon's conjecture concerns the classification of groups with a 2-sphere at infinity:  Cannon's conjecture : Every Gromov  hyperbolic group with a 2-sphere at infinity acts geometrically on hyperbolic 3-space . 6  The analog to this conjecture is known to be true for 1-spheres and false for spheres of all dimension greater than 2.
