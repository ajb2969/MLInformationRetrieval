Presheaf of spaces

In mathematics, a presheaf of spaces on an ∞-category C is a contravariant functor from C to the ∞-category of spaces (for example, the nerve of the category of CW-complexes.)1 It is an ∞-category version of a sheaf of sets, as a "set" is replaced by a "space". The notion is used, among other things, in the ∞-category formulation of Yoneda's lemma that says
 
 
 
  is fully faithful (here C can be just a simplicial set.)2
