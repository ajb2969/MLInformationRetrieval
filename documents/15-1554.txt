Xanthan ketal pyruvate transferase

Xanthan ketal pyruvate transferase (, KPT) is an enzyme with system name phosphoenolpyruvate:D-Man-beta-(1->4)-GlcA-beta-(1->2)-D-Man-alpha-(1->3)-D-Glc-beta-(1->4)-D-Glc-alpha-1-diphospho-ditrans,octacis-undecaprenol 4,6-O-(1-carboxyethan-1,1-diyl)transferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

phosphoenolpyruvate + D-Man-beta-(1->4)-D-GlcA-beta-(1->2)-D-Man-alpha-(1->3)-D-Glc-beta-(1->4)-D-Glc-alpha-1-diphospho-ditrans,octacis-undecaprenol 
 
 
 
  4,6-CH3(COO-)C-D-Man-beta-(1->4)-D-GlcA-beta-(1->2)-D-Man-alpha-(1->3)-D-Glc-beta-(1->4)-D-Glc-alpha-1-diphospho-ditrans,octacis-undecaprenol + phosphate


This enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of the polysaccharide xanthan.
