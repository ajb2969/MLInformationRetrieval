   Cauchy–Euler operator      Cauchy–Euler operator   In mathematics a Cauchy–Euler operator is a differential operator of the form     p   (  x  )    ⋅   d   d  x       normal-⋅    p  x     d    d  x      p(x)\cdot{d\over dx}    1 for a polynomial p . It is named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy and Leonhard Euler . The simplest example is that in which p ( x ) = x , which has eigenvalues n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... and corresponding eigenfunctions x n .
