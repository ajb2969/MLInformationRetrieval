Proportionality for Solid Coalitions

Proportionality for Solid Coalitions (PSC) is a voting system criterion relating to ranked voting systems. It's the essential requirement1 to guarantee a proportional representation of voters in multiple winner ranked voting systems.
Solid Coalitions
A set of voters 
 
 
 
  is a solid coalition for a set of candidates 
 
 
 
 , if every voter in 
 
 
 
  ranks every candidate in 
 
 
 
 
  ahead of every candidate that is not in 
 
 
 
 .
In the following let 
 
 
 
  be the number of voters, 
 
 
 
  be the number of seats to be filled and 
 
 
 
  be some positive integer.


 
 
 –PSC


 
 –PSC is defined with respect to the Hare quota

 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is a solid coalition for 
 
 
 
  and the number of Voters in 
 
 
 
 
  is at least 
 
 
 
  Hare quotas, then at least 
 
 
 
  candidates from 
 
 
 
  must be elected (if 
 
 
 
  has less than 
 
 
 
 
  candidates at all, then all of them have to be elected).2 This criterion was proposed by Michael Dummett.3


 
 –PSC


 
 –PSC is defined like 
 
 
 
 –PSC, but with respect to the Hagenbach-Bischoff quota

 
  instead of the Hare quota: the number of voters in 
 
 
 
 
  must exceed 
 
 
 
  Hagenbach-Bischoff quotas.4 It is a generalization of the majority criterion in the sense that it relates to groups of supported candidates (solid coalitions) instead of just one candidate, and there may be more than one seat to be filled. Because some authors call the fraction 
 
 
Droop Quota, 
 
 
 
 –PSC is also known as Droop proportionality criterion.5
