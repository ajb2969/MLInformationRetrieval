   Tyrosine decarboxylase      Tyrosine decarboxylase   In enzymology , a tyrosine decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-tyrosine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   tyramine + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , L-tyrosine , and two products , tyramine and carbon dioxide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-tyrosine carboxy-lyase (tyramine-forming) . Other names in common use include L-tyrosine decarboxylase , L-(−)-tyrosine apodecarboxylase , and L-tyrosine carboxy-lyase . This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism and alkaloid biosynthesis. It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .
