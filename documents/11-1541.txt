   Myosin-heavy-chain kinase      Myosin-heavy-chain kinase   In enzymology , a myosin-heavy-chain kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + [myosin heavy-chain]   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + [myosin heavy-chain] phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and myosin heavy-chain , whereas its two products are ADP and myosin heavy-chain phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring a phosphate group to the sidechain oxygen atom of serine or threonine residues in proteins ( protein-serine/threonine kinases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:[myosin heavy-chain] O-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include   ATP:myosin-heavy-chain O-phosphotransferase  calmodulin-dependent myosin heavy chain kinase  MHCK  MIHC kinase  myosin heavy chain kinase  myosin I heavy-chain kinase  myosin II heavy-chain kinase  [myosin-heavy-chain] kinase  myosin heavy chain kinase A  STK6.
