   Direction cosine      Direction cosine   In analytic geometry , the direction cosines (or directional cosines ) of a vector are the cosines of the angles between the vector and the three coordinate axes. Or equivalently it is the component contributions of the basis to the unit vector.  Three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates    If v is a Euclidean vector in three-dimensional  Euclidean space , ℝ 3 ,      𝐯  =     v  x    𝐞  x    +    v  y    𝐞  y    +    v  z    𝐞  z         𝐯       subscript  v  x    subscript  𝐞  x       subscript  v  y    subscript  𝐞  y       subscript  v  z    subscript  𝐞  z       {\mathbf{v}}=v_{\text{x}}\mathbf{e}_{\text{x}}+v_{\text{y}}\mathbf{e}_{\text{y%
 }}+v_{\text{z}}\mathbf{e}_{\text{z}}     where e x , e y , e z are the standard basis in Cartesian notation, then the direction cosines are     α   α   \displaystyle\alpha     It follows that by squaring each equation and adding the results:         cos  2   a   +    cos  2   b   +    cos  2   c    =  1 .          superscript   2   a     superscript   2   b     superscript   2   c    1 .    \cos^{2}a+\cos^{2}b+\cos^{2}c=1\,.     Here, α , β and γ are the direction cosines and the Cartesian coordinates of the unit vector  v /| v |, and a , b and c are the direction angles of the vector v .  The direction angles a , b and c are acute or obtuse angles , i.e., 0 ≤ a ≤ π, 0 ≤ b ≤ π and 0 ≤ c ≤ π and they denote the angles formed between v and the unit basis vectors, e x , e y and e z .  General meaning  More generally, direction cosine refers to the cosine of the angle between any two vectors . They are useful for forming direction cosine matrices that express one set of orthonormal  basis vectors in terms of another set, or for expressing a known vector in a different basis.
