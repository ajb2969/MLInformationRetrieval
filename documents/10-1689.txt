Phosphoglucosamine mutase




Phosphoglucosamine mutase

In enzymology, a phosphoglucosamine mutase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

alpha-D-glucosamine 1-phosphate 
 
 
 
  D-glucosamine 6-phosphate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, alpha-D-glucosamine 1-phosphate, and one product, D-glucosamine 6-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically the phosphotransferases (phosphomutases), which transfer phosphate groups within a molecule. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alpha-D-glucosamine 1,6-phosphomutase. This enzyme participates in aminosugars metabolism.
