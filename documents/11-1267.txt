Globotriaosylceramide 3-beta-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase




Globotriaosylceramide 3-beta-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase

In enzymology, a globotriaosylceramide 3-beta-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine + alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucosyl- (11)-ceramide 
 
 
 
  UDP + N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl-(1->3)-alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->4)- beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucosyl-(11)-ceramide
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucosyl-, and (11)-ceramide, whereas its 3 products are UDP, N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl-(1->3)-alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-, and beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucosyl-(11)-ceramide.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine:alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-galact osyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucosyl-(11)-ceramide III3-beta-N-acetyl-D-galactosaminyltransferase. Other names in common use include uridine, diphosphoacetylgalactosamine-galactosylgalactosylglucosylceramide, acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, globoside synthetase, UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine:globotriaosylceramide, beta-3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, galactosylgalactosylglucosylceramide, beta-D-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine:globotriaosylceramide, beta1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, globoside synthase, galactosylgalactosylglucosylceramide, beta-D-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine:D-galactosyl-1,4-D-galactosyl-1,4-D-, glucosylceramide beta-N-acetyl-D-galactosaminyltransferase, beta3GalNAc-T1, UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine:alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-, galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucosylceramide, 3III-beta-N-acetyl-D-galactosaminyltransferase, UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine:alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-, galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucosyl-(11)-ceramide, and 3III-beta-N-acetyl-D-galactosaminyltransferase. This enzyme participates in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis - globoseries and glycan structures - biosynthesis 2.
