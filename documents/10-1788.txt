   S-carboxymethylcysteine synthase      S-carboxymethylcysteine synthase   In enzymology , a S-carboxymethylcysteine synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-chloro-L-alanine + thioglycolate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-carboxymethyl-L-cysteine + chloride   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-chloro-L-alanine and thioglycolate , whereas its two products are S-carboxymethyl-L-cysteine and chloride .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the class of carbon-halide lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-chloro-L-alanine chloride-lyase (adding thioglycolate S-carboxymethyl-L-cysteine-forming) . This enzyme is also called S-carboxymethyl-L-cysteine synthase . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .
