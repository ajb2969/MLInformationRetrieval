   Korn's inequality      Korn's inequality   In mathematical analysis , Korn's inequality is an inequality concerning the gradient of a vector field that generalizes the following classical theorem: if the gradient of a vector field is skew-symmetric at every point, then the gradient must be equal to a constant skew-symmetric matrix. Korn's theorem is a quantitative version of this statement, which intuitively says that if the gradient of a vector field is on average not far from the space of skew-symmetric matrices, then the gradient must not be far from a particular skew-symmetric matrix. The statement that Korn's inequality generalizes thus arises as a special case of rigidity .  In (linear) elasticity theory , the symmetric part of the gradient is a measure of the strain that an elastic body experiences when it is deformed by a given vector-valued function. The inequality is therefore an important tool as an a priori estimate in linear elasticity theory.  Statement of the inequality  Let   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   be an open , connected domain in   n   n   n   - dimensional  Euclidean space  ,    n  ≥   2      n  normal-≥  normal-  2    n≥ 2   . Let be the Sobolev space of all vector fields  on   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   that, along with their weak derivatives, lie in the Lebesgue space  . Denoting the partial derivative with respect to the i th component by , the norm in is given by         ∥  v  ∥     H  1    (  Ω  )     :=    (     ∫  Ω     ∑   i  =  1   n       |    v  i    (  x  )    |   2    d  x     +    ∫  Ω     ∑    i  ,  j   =  1   n       |     ∂  j    v  i     (  x  )    |   2    d  x      )    1  /  2     .     assign   subscript   norm  v      superscript  H  1   normal-Ω     superscript      subscript   normal-Ω     superscript   subscript     i  1    n      superscript       superscript  v  i   x    2   normal-d  x       subscript   normal-Ω     superscript   subscript      i  j   1    n      superscript        subscript   j    superscript  v  i    x    2   normal-d  x        1  2      \|v\|_{H^{1}(\Omega)}:=\left(\int_{\Omega}\sum_{i=1}^{n}|v^{i}(x)|^{2}\,%
 \mathrm{d}x+\int_{\Omega}\sum_{i,j=1}^{n}|\partial_{j}v^{i}(x)|^{2}\,\mathrm{d%
 }x\right)^{1/2}.     Then there is a constant    C  ≥   0      C  normal-≥  normal-  0    C≥ 0   , known as the Korn constant of   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   , such that, for all ,  where   e   e   e   denotes the symmetrized gradient given by         e   i  j    v   =    1  2    (     ∂  i    v  j    +    ∂  j    v  i     )     .         subscript  e    i  j    v       1  2       subscript   i    superscript  v  j      subscript   j    superscript  v  i        e_{ij}v=\frac{1}{2}(\partial_{i}v^{j}+\partial_{j}v^{i}).
