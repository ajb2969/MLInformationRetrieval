   Tapering (mathematics)      Tapering (mathematics)   In mathematics , physics , and theoretical computer graphics , tapering is a kind of shape deformation. 1 2 Just as an affine transformation, such as scaling or shearing, is a first-order model of shape deformation, there also exist higher-order deformations such as tapering, twisting, and bending. Tapering can be thought of as non-constant scaling by a given tapering function. The resultant deformations can be linear or nonlinear.  To create a nonlinear taper, instead of scaling in x and y for all z with constants as in:       q  =    [     a    0    0      0    b    0      0    0    1     ]   p    ,      q      a  0  0    0  b  0    0  0  1    p     q=\begin{bmatrix}a&0&0\\
 0&b&0\\
 0&0&1\end{bmatrix}p,     let a and b be functions of z so that:       q  =    [      a   (   p  z   )      0    0      0     b   (   p  z   )      0      0    0    1     ]   p    .      q        a   subscript  p  z    0  0    0    b   subscript  p  z    0    0  0  1    p     q=\begin{bmatrix}a(p_{z})&0&0\\
 0&b(p_{z})&0\\
 0&0&1\end{bmatrix}p.     An example of a linear taper is     a   (  z  )    =    α  0   +    α  1   z          a  z      subscript  α  0      subscript  α  1   z      a(z)=\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1}z   , and a quadratic taper     a   (  z  )    =    α  0   +    α  1   z   +    α  2    z  2           a  z      subscript  α  0      subscript  α  1   z      subscript  α  2    superscript  z  2       a(z)={\alpha}_{0}+{\alpha}_{1}z+{\alpha}_{2}z^{2}   .  As another example, if the parametric equation of a cube were given by ƒ ( t ) = ( x ( t ), y ( t ), z ( t )), a nonlinear taper could be applied so that the cube's volume slowly decreases (or tapers) as the function moves in the positive z direction. For the given cube, an example of a nonlinear taper along z would be if, for instance, the function T ( z ) = 1/( a + bt ) were applied to the cube's equation such that ƒ ( t ) = ( T ( z ) x ( t ), T ( z ) y ( t ), T ( z ) z ( t )), for some real constants a and b .
