Trudinger's theorem

In mathematical analysis, Trudinger's theorem or the Trudinger inequality (also sometimes called the Moser–Trudinger inequality) is a result of functional analysis on Sobolev spaces. It is named after Neil Trudinger (and Jürgen Moser).
It provides an inequality between a certain Sobolev space norm and an Orlicz space norm of a function. The inequality is a limiting case of Sobolev imbedding and can be stated as the following theorem:
Let 
 
 
 
  be a bounded domain in 
 
 
 
  satisfying the cone condition. Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Set



Then there exists the imbedding



where



The space



is an example of an Orlicz space.
