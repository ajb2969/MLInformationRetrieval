Methanogen homoaconitase

Methanogen homoaconitase (, methanogen HACN) is an enzyme with system name (R)-2-hydroxybutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate hydro-lyase ((1R,2S)-1-hydroxybutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(R)-2-hydroxybutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate 
 
 
 
  (1R,2S)-1-hydroxybutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate (overall reaction)
 
(1a) (R)-2-hydroxybutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate 
 
 
 
  (Z)-but-1-ene-1,2,4-tricarboxylate + H2O
 
(1b) (Z)-but-1-ene-1,2,4-tricarboxylate + H2O 
 
 
 
  (1R,2S)-1-hydroxybutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate
 

This enzyme catalyses several reactions in the pathway of coenzyme-B biosynthesis in methanogenic archaea.
