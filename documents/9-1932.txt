Bergman metric

In differential geometry, the Bergman metric is a Hermitian metric that can be defined on certain types of complex manifold. It is so called because it is derived from the Bergman kernel, both of which are named for Stefan Bergman.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a domain and let 
 
 
 
  be the Bergman kernel on G. We define a Hermitian metric on the tangent bundle

 
  by


 
  for 
 
 
 
 . Then the length of a tangent vector 
 
 
 
  is given by



This metric is called the Bergman metric on G.
The length of a (piecewise) C1 curve

 
  is then computed as



The distance 
 
 
 
  of two points 
 
 
 
  is then defined as



The distance dG is called the Bergman distance.
The Bergman metric is in fact a positive definite matrix at each point if G is a bounded domain. More importantly, the distance dG is invariant under biholomorphic mappings of G to another domain 
 
 
 
 . That is if f is a biholomorphism of G and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 .
