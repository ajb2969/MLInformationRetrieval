   Closed category      Closed category   In category theory , a branch of mathematics , a closed category is a special kind of category .  In a locally small category , the external hom ( x , y ) takes two objects to the set of morphisms. So in the category of sets, this is an object of the category itself. In the same vein, in a closed category, the morphisms from one object to another can be seen as lying inside the category. This is the internal hom [ x , y ].  Every closed category has a forgetful functor to the category of sets , which in particular takes the internal hom to the external hom.  Definition  A closed category can be defined as a category V with a so-called internal Hom functor       [  -  -  ]   :   V   o  p    ×  V  →  V     fragments   fragments  normal-[    normal-]   normal-:   superscript  V    o  p     V  normal-→  V    \left[-\ -\right]:V^{op}\times V\to V   ,  left Yoneda arrows  natural in   B   B   B   and   C   C   C   and dinatural in   A   A   A         L  :    [    B   C   ]   →   [    [    A   B   ]    [    A   C   ]    ]       normal-:  L   normal-→   delimited-[]    B  C     delimited-[]     delimited-[]    A  B     delimited-[]    A  C         L:\left[B\ C\right]\to\left[\left[A\ B\right]\left[A\ C\right]\right]     and a fixed object I of V such that there is a natural isomorphism       i  A   :   A  ≅   [    I   A   ]       normal-:   subscript  i  A     A   delimited-[]    I  A       i_{A}:A\cong\left[I\ A\right]     and a dinatural transformation        j  A   :   I  →   [    A   A   ]     .     normal-:   subscript  j  A    normal-→  I   delimited-[]    A  A       j_{A}:I\to\left[A\ A\right].\,     Examples   Cartesian closed categories are closed categories. In particular, any topos is closed. The canonical example is the category of sets .    Compact closed categories are closed categories. The canonical example is the category  FdVect with finite-dimensional vector spaces as objects and linear maps as morphisms.    More generally, any monoidal closed category is a closed category. In this case, the object   I   I   I   is the monoidal unit.   References   Eilenberg, S. & Kelly, G.M. Closed categories Proceedings of the Conference on Categorical Algebra.
