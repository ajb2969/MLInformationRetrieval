   Ternary relation      Ternary relation   In mathematics , a ternary relation or triadic relation is a finitary relation in which the number of places in the relation is three. Ternary relations may also be referred to as 3-adic , 3-ary , 3-dimensional , or 3-place .  Just as a binary relation is formally defined as a set of pairs , i.e. a subset of the Cartesian product of some sets A and B , so a ternary relation is a set of triples, forming a subset of the Cartesian product  of three sets A , B and C .  An example of a ternary relation in elementary geometry is the collinearity of points .  Examples  Binary functions  A function  in two variables, taking values in two sets A and B , respectively, is formally a function that associates to every pair ( a , b ) in  an element ƒ ( a , b ) in C . Therefore its graph consists of pairs of the form . Such pairs in which the first element is itself a pair are often identified with triples. This makes the graph of ƒ a ternary relation between A , B and C , consisting of all triples , for all a in A and b in B .  Cyclic orders  Given any set A whose elements are arranged on a circle, one can define a ternary relation R on A , i.e. a subset of A 3 = , by stipulating that  holds if and only if the elements a , b and c are pairwise different and when going from a to c in a clockwise direction one passes through b . For example if A = {  } represents the hours on a clock face , then  holds and  does not hold.  Betweenness relations  Congruence relation  The ordinary congruence of arithmetics      a  ≡   b     (   mod  m   )        a   annotated  b   pmod  m      a\equiv b\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}m)   which holds for three integers a , b , and m if and only if m divides a - b , formally may be considered as a ternary relation. However, usually, this instead is considered as a family of binary relations between the a and the b , indexed by the modulus  m . For each fixed m , indeed this binary relation has some natural properties, like being an equivalence relation ; while the combined ternary relation in general is not studied as one relation.  Typing relation  A typing relation     Γ  ⊢   e   :  σ       proves  normal-Γ  e    normal-:    σ     \Gamma\vdash e\!:\!\sigma   indicates that   e   e   e   is a term of type   σ   σ   \sigma   in context   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   , and is thus a ternary relation between contexts, terms and types.
