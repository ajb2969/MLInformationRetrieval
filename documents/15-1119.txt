1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate hydroxylase

1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate hydroxylase (, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid hydroxylase) is an enzyme with system name 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate,NAD(P)H:oxygen oxidoreductase (2-hydroxylating, decarboxylating).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate + NAD(P)H + H+ + O2

 
  1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene + NAD(P)+ + H2O + CO2


1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate hydroxylase is involved in chrysene degradation in some bacteria.
