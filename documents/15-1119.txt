   1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate hydroxylase      1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate hydroxylase   1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate hydroxylase (, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid hydroxylase ) is an enzyme with system name 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate,NAD(P)H:oxygen oxidoreductase (2-hydroxylating, decarboxylating) . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate + NAD(P)H + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene + NAD(P)+ + H 2 O + CO 2    1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate hydroxylase is involved in chrysene degradation in some bacteria .
