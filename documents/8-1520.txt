   SABR volatility model      SABR volatility model   In mathematical finance , the SABR model is a stochastic volatility model, which attempts to capture the volatility smile in derivatives markets. The name stands for " stochastic  alpha , beta , rho ", referring to the parameters of the model. The SABR model is widely used by practitioners in the financial industry, especially in the interest rate derivative markets. It was developed by Patrick Hagan , Deep Kumar , Andrew Lesniewski , and Diana Woodward .  Dynamics  The SABR model describes a single forward   F   F   F   , such as a LIBOR  forward rate , a forward swap rate, or a forward stock price. The volatility of the forward   F   F   F   is described by a parameter   σ   σ   \sigma   . SABR is a dynamic model in which both   F   F   F   and   σ   σ   \sigma   are represented by stochastic state variables whose time evolution is given by the following system of stochastic differential equations :        d   F  t    =    σ  t     F  t  β    d   W  t     ,        d   subscript  F  t       subscript  σ  t    subscript   superscript  F  β   t   d   subscript  W  t      dF_{t}=\sigma_{t}F^{\beta}_{t}\,dW_{t},           d   σ  t    =   α    σ  t    d   Z  t     ,        d   subscript  σ  t      α   subscript  σ  t   d   subscript  Z  t      d\sigma_{t}=\alpha\sigma_{t}\,dZ_{t},     with the prescribed time zero (currently observed) values    F  0     subscript  F  0    F_{0}   and    σ  0     subscript  σ  0    \sigma_{0}   . Here,    W  t     subscript  W  t    W_{t}   and    Z  t     subscript  Z  t    Z_{t}   are two correlated Wiener processes with correlation coefficient     -  1   <  ρ  <  1          1   ρ       1     -1<\rho<1   :       d   W  t   d   Z  t    =   ρ  d  t         d   subscript  W  t   d   subscript  Z  t      ρ  d  t     dW_{t}dZ_{t}=\rho dt     The constant parameters    β  ,  α     β  α    \beta,\;\alpha   satisfy the conditions     0  ≤  β  ≤  1   ,   α  ≥  0      formulae-sequence      0  β       1      α  0     0\leq\beta\leq 1,\;\alpha\geq 0   .  The above dynamics is a stochastic version of the CEV model with the skewness parameter   β   β   \beta   : in fact, it reduces to the CEV model if    α  =  0      α  0    \alpha=0   The parameter   α   α   \alpha   is often referred to as the volvol , and its meaning is that of the lognormal volatility of the volatility parameter   σ   σ   \sigma   .  Asymptotic solution  We consider a European option (say, a call) on the forward   F   F   F   struck at   K   K   K   , which expires   T   T   T   years from now. The value of this option is equal to the suitably discounted expected value of the payoff    max   (    F  T   -  K   ,  0  )          subscript  F  T   K   0    \max\left(F_{T}-K,\;0\right)   under the probability distribution of the process    F  t     subscript  F  t    F_{t}   .  Except for the special cases of    β  =  0      β  0    \beta=0   and    β  =  1      β  1    \beta=1   , no closed form expression for this probability distribution is known. The general case can be solved approximately by means of an asymptotic expansion in the parameter    ε  =   T   α  2        ε    T   superscript  α  2      \varepsilon=T\alpha^{2}   . Under typical market conditions, this parameter is small and the approximate solution is actually quite accurate. Also significantly, this solution has a rather simple functional form, is very easy to implement in computer code, and lends itself well to risk management of large portfolios of options in real time.  It is convenient to express the solution in terms of the implied volatility of the option. Namely, we force the SABR model price of the option into the form of the Black model valuation formula. Then the implied volatility, which is the value of the lognormal volatility parameter in Black's model that forces it to match the SABR price, is approximately given by:        σ  impl   =    α      log   (    F  0   /  K   )     D   (  ζ  )       {   1  +    [         2   γ  2    -   γ  1  2    +   1  /   F  mid  2     24      (     σ  0   C   (   F  mid   )    α   )   2    +      ρ   γ  1    4       σ  0   C   (   F  mid   )    α    +    2  -   3   ρ  2     24    ]   ε    }     ,       subscript  σ  impl     α         subscript  F  0   K      D  ζ       1     delimited-[]              2   subscript  γ  2     superscript   subscript  γ  1   2      1   superscript   subscript  F  mid   2     24    superscript       subscript  σ  0   C   subscript  F  mid    α   2          ρ   subscript  γ  1    4        subscript  σ  0   C   subscript  F  mid    α        2    3   superscript  ρ  2     24     ε        \sigma_{\text{impl}}=\alpha\;\frac{\log\left(F_{0}/K\right)}{D\left(\zeta%

 \frac{\rho\gamma_{1}}{4}\;\frac{\sigma_{0}C\left(F_{\text{mid}}\right)}{\alpha%
 }+\frac{2-3\rho^{2}}{24}\right]\varepsilon\right\},     where, for clarity, we have set     C   (  F  )    =   F  β         C  F    superscript  F  β     C\left(F\right)=F^{\beta}   . The value    F  mid     subscript  F  mid    F_{\text{mid}}   denotes a conveniently chosen midpoint between    F  0     subscript  F  0    F_{0}   and   K   K   K   (such as the geometric average      F  0   K          subscript  F  0   K     \sqrt{F_{0}K}   or the arithmetic average     (    F  0   +  K   )   /  2         subscript  F  0   K   2    \left(F_{0}+K\right)/2   ). We have also set       ζ  =     α   σ  0       ∫  K   F  0      d  x    C   (  x  )       =     α    σ  0    (   1  -  β   )       (    F  0   1  -  β    -   K   1  -  β     )     ,        ζ      α   subscript  σ  0      superscript   subscript   K    subscript  F  0        d  x     C  x               α     subscript  σ  0     1  β        superscript   subscript  F  0     1  β     superscript  K    1  β         \zeta=\frac{\alpha}{\sigma_{0}}\;\int_{K}^{F_{0}}\frac{dx}{C\left(x\right)}=%
 \frac{\alpha}{\sigma_{0}\left(1-\beta\right)}\;\left(F_{0}^{1-\beta}-K^{1-%
 \beta}\right),     and        γ  1   =     C  ′    (   F  mid   )     C   (   F  mid   )     =    β   F  mid      ,         subscript  γ  1        superscript  C  normal-′    subscript  F  mid      C   subscript  F  mid            β   subscript  F  mid       \gamma_{1}=\frac{C^{\prime}\left(F_{\text{mid}}\right)}{C\left(F_{\text{mid}}%
 \right)}=\frac{\beta}{F_{\text{mid}}}\;,           γ  2   =     C  ′′    (   F  mid   )     C   (   F  mid   )     =   -     β   (   1  -  β   )     F  mid  2       .         subscript  γ  2        superscript  C  ′′    subscript  F  mid      C   subscript  F  mid                β    1  β     superscript   subscript  F  mid   2        \gamma_{2}=\frac{C^{\prime\prime}\left(F_{\text{mid}}\right)}{C\left(F_{\text{%
 mid}}\right)}=-\frac{\beta\left(1-\beta\right)}{F_{\text{mid}}^{2}}\;.     The function    D   (  ζ  )       D  ζ    D\left(\zeta\right)   entering the formula above is given by        D   (  ζ  )    =   log   (        1  -   2  ρ  ζ    +   ζ  2     +  ζ   -  ρ    1  -  ρ    )     .        D  ζ                 1    2  ρ  ζ     superscript  ζ  2     ζ   ρ     1  ρ       D\left(\zeta\right)=\log\left(\frac{\sqrt{1-2\rho\zeta+\zeta^{2}}+\zeta-\rho}{%
 1-\rho}\right).     Alternatively, one can express the SABR price in terms of the normal Black's model. Then the implied normal volatility can be asymptotically computed by means of the following expression:        σ  impl  n   =    α       F  0   -  K    D   (  ζ  )       {   1  +    [        2   γ  2    -   γ  1  2    24      (     σ  0   C   (   F  mid   )    α   )   2    +      ρ   γ  1    4       σ  0   C   (   F  mid   )    α    +    2  -   3   ρ  2     24    ]   ε    }     .       superscript   subscript  σ  impl   n     α       subscript  F  0   K     D  ζ       1     delimited-[]            2   subscript  γ  2     superscript   subscript  γ  1   2    24    superscript       subscript  σ  0   C   subscript  F  mid    α   2          ρ   subscript  γ  1    4        subscript  σ  0   C   subscript  F  mid    α        2    3   superscript  ρ  2     24     ε        \sigma_{\text{impl}}^{\text{n}}=\alpha\;\frac{F_{0}-K}{D\left(\zeta\right)}\;%
 \left\{1+\left[\frac{2\gamma_{2}-\gamma_{1}^{2}}{24}\;\left(\frac{\sigma_{0}C%
 \left(F_{\text{mid}}\right)}{\alpha}\right)^{2}+\frac{\rho\gamma_{1}}{4}\;%
 \frac{\sigma_{0}C\left(F_{\text{mid}}\right)}{\alpha}+\frac{2-3\rho^{2}}{24}%
 \right]\varepsilon\right\}.     It is worth noting that the normal SABR implied volatility is generally somewhat more accurate than the lognormal implied volatility.  SABR for the negative rates  The SABR model can be modified to cover also Negative interest rate :        d   F  t    =    σ  t      |   F  t   |   β    d   W  t     ,        d   subscript  F  t       subscript  σ  t    superscript     subscript  F  t    β   d   subscript  W  t      dF_{t}=\sigma_{t}|F_{t}|^{\beta}\,dW_{t},           d   σ  t    =   α    σ  t    d   Z  t     ,        d   subscript  σ  t      α   subscript  σ  t   d   subscript  Z  t      d\sigma_{t}=\alpha\sigma_{t}\,dZ_{t},     for    0  ≤  β  ≤   1  /  2         0  β         1  2      0\leq\beta\leq 1/2   and a free boundary condition for    F  =  0      F  0    F=0   . Its exact solution for the zero correlation as well as an efficient approximation for a general case are available. 1  Another SABR model extension for negative rates that gained popularity in the recent years is the shifted SABR model, where shifted forward rate is assumed to follow a SABR process        d   F  t    =    σ  t      (    F  t   +  s   )   β    d   W  t     ,        d   subscript  F  t       subscript  σ  t    superscript     subscript  F  t   s   β   d   subscript  W  t      dF_{t}=\sigma_{t}(F_{t}+s)^{\beta}\,dW_{t},           d   σ  t    =   α    σ  t    d   Z  t     ,        d   subscript  σ  t      α   subscript  σ  t   d   subscript  Z  t      d\sigma_{t}=\alpha\sigma_{t}\,dZ_{t},     for some positive shift   s   s   s   . An obvious drawback of this approach is the a priori selection of the shift, and the resulting possibility of needing to adjust this shift further once the rates go still more negative.
