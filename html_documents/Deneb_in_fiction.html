Deneb's absolute magnitude is approximately −7.0, one of the greatest intrinsic brightnesses of any known star, which gives it an estimated luminosity nearly 60,000 times that of our Sun (see "<a href="#Literature" title="wikilink">Uncommon Sense</a>" by Hal Clement, below). It appears to have a <strong>diameter of about 110 times that of the Sun</strong> (see graphic), but a mass only 20 times as great<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>—bespeaking a tenuous average density approximately 10<sup>−5</sup> times that of our own star.<mtpl></mtpl></p>

<p>Deneb is the brightest star in the constellation Cygnus and the nineteenth brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent visual magnitude of 1.25. It is a vertex of the <a href="Summer_Triangle" title="wikilink">Summer Triangle</a>, the other two vertices being the bright stars <a href="Altair_in_fiction" title="wikilink">Altair</a> and <a href="Vega_in_fiction" title="wikilink">Vega</a> (see <em><a href="#General_uses_of_Deneb" title="wikilink">High Sierra</a></em>, below).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>The name Deneb is from the Arabic (ذنب الدجاجة dhanab ad-dajāja<sup>h</sup>), which translates literally as <strong>tail</strong> of the hen.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In Chinese, "天津" (Tiān Jīn), meaning <strong><em>Celestial Ford</em></strong>, refers to an <a href="Asterism_(astronomy)" title="wikilink">asterism</a> consisting of Deneb and eight other stars in Cygnus (see graphic, below). In a legendary Chinese love story, Deneb marks the location of the <em><a class="uri" href="magpie" title="wikilink">magpie</a> bridge</em> across the Milky Way,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> which allows two lovers represented by the stars Altair and Vega—the other two vertices of the Summer Triangle—to be reunited on one special night of the year in late summer<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> (See Qi Xi, below).</p>

<p> Deneb may be referred to in fictional works for its <a href="metaphor" title="wikilink">metaphorical</a> (<strong>meta</strong>) or <a href="mythology" title="wikilink">mythological</a> (<strong>myth</strong>) associations, or else as a bright point of light in the <a href="Night_sky" title="wikilink"><strong>sky</strong> of the Earth</a>, but not as a location in space or the center of a planetary system:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="Qixi_Festival" title="wikilink">Qi Xi</a></em> (206 BCE – 220 CE), "the night of sevens," festival honoring a Han dynasty legend. The young cowherd Niú Láng (Altair) meets by chance and marries Zhī Nŭ the weavergirl (Vega), seventh daughter of the Celestial Goddess; the two live happily together and have a pair of children (his flanking stars β and γ Aquilae). The Goddess, furious that Zhī Nŭ has married a mere mortal, orders her home to resume her day job weaving colorful clouds. Niú Láng follows her, but is not unnoticed by the mother, who angrily uses her hairpin to scratch a wide river in the sky—the Milky Way—to separate the lovers forever. Once a year all the magpies in the world take pity on them and fly up to heaven to form a bridge over the star <em>Deneb</em> in Cygnus, so that they may be together for a single <strong>night</strong><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> (see graphic). (<strong>myth</strong>)</li>
<li><em><a href="High_Sierra_(film)" title="wikilink">High Sierra</a></em> (1941), film written by <a href="John_Huston" title="wikilink">John Huston</a> and <a href="W._R._Burnett" title="wikilink">W. R. Burnett</a>, and directed by <a href="Raoul_Walsh" title="wikilink">Raoul Walsh</a>. On his way to a planned heist in the Sierra Nevada mountains, Roy Earle (<a href="Humphrey_Bogart" title="wikilink">Humphrey Bogart</a>) meets Velma (<a href="Joan_Leslie" title="wikilink">Joan Leslie</a>). Under the night sky one romantic evening, he points out various stars to her: [ROY] ''... you see different stars at different times. They change with the seasons. See that other bright star sorta northeast of Vega? That's <em>Deneb</em> in the constellation Cygnus, I think. I'm getting kind of rusty...'' [Velma's face is upward, her hair falls back. Roy looks at it. Their hands meet.] (<strong>sky</strong>)</li>
<li><em><a href="Eden_(Lem_novel)" title="wikilink">Eden</a></em> (1959), novel written by <a href="Stanisław_Lem" title="wikilink">Stanisław Lem</a>. A starship crew—a captain, a doctor, an engineer, a chemist, a physicist and a cyberneticist—crash land for an unknown reason on an alien world they call Eden. They make a series of increasingly odd discoveries, culminating in contact with the totalitarian <em>doubler</em> civilization, ruled by a dictatorship that denies its own existence and is thus impossible to destroy. After a day of upsetting events, the crew sit around a camp stove talking, then: <em>... When they extinguished the stove, they were plunged into total darkness. The stars above sparkled intensely in what seemed a peculiarly low sky. "Deneb," said the Physicist softly. The men looked up…</em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> (<strong>sky</strong>)</li>

In this allegory, a space explorer uses the black hole <a href="Cygnus_X-1" title="wikilink">Cygnus X-1</a> as a portal to <em>Olympus</em> where he encounters a <a href="Apollonian_and_Dionysian#Nietzsche's_usage" title="wikilink">Nietzschean</a> conflict, couched in terms of Greek mythology, between the Apollonian and Dionysian world views. The star <em>Deneb</em> (also in Cygnus, four times closer to the Earth) serves as his guiding light to the more distant, invisible singularity: <em>I set a course just east of Lyra/ ... /Flew into the light of Deneb/Sailed across the Milky Way/ ... /Headed for the heart of Cygnus/Headlong into mystery ...</em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> (<strong>myth</strong>, <strong>meta</strong>)</li>

<p> In the listing below, the majority of literary references to Deneb occurred in the score of years after 1943, the star's banner year as a <em>cynosure</em> when its spectrum was selected as one of the <a href="Deneb#Distance_and_physical_properties" title="wikilink">stable anchor points</a> by which all other stars' spectra would be classified.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> There followed a hiatus of 30 years, until a cluster of works representing renewed interest in the star appeared around the year 1990.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="Captain_Future#Stories" title="wikilink">#15. Star of Dread</a></em> (1943) and other books in the <a href="Captain_Future" title="wikilink">Captain Future</a> series, number written by <a href="Edmond_Hamilton" title="wikilink">Edmond Hamilton</a>. Captain Future is Curtis Newton, a brilliant scientist and adventurer who roams the Solar System solving problems, righting wrongs, and vanquishing supervillains. All of the planets of the system and many of the moons and asteroids are suitable for life, and most are inhabited by humanoids. Future and his sidekicks the <em>Futuremen</em> visit the planet <strong>Aar</strong> in the Deneb system (see graphic), which is the origin of Earth humans, as well as many manlike races across the Solar System and beyond.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></li>

<li>"<a href="Uncommon_Sense" title="wikilink">Uncommon Sense</a>" (1945), short story by <a href="Hal_Clement" title="wikilink">Hal Clement</a>. After his two-man crew mutinies, skipper Laird Cunningham disables his space-boat and maroons the craft on a sun-blasted <strong>moonlike planet</strong> of Deneb. Clement indulges in a seductive—and technically plausible—description of the world's outrageous native life forms: predators whose "blood" is liquid metal, "eyes" that are actually pinhole cameras for straight-trajectoried gas molecules. Using his uncommon ingenuity, Cunningham is able to exploit these biological peculiarities to regain control of his ship and imprison the mutineers,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> acting out the classic hard science fiction theme of solving a scientific puzzle set up by the conditions of an alien world.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></li>
<li>"Dead Ahead" (1950), short story published as "Ultimate Quest" in <em><a href="Super_Science_Stories" title="wikilink">Super Science Stories</a></em> and written by <a href="Jack_Vance" title="wikilink">Jack Vance</a> as by John Holbrook. The story's protagonist Chiram wants to circumnavigate the universe. The inventor of the inertialess <em>destriation</em> FTL drive, he believes that the four-dimensional manifold of space-time is a closed <strong>Riemannian sphere</strong> (see graphic), and that if he flies in a perfectly straight line far enough and fast enough, he will return to his starting point, the Earth, in his lifetime. But if he deviates by even the tiniest amount from a straight line, or if the <a href="Shape_of_the_Universe" title="wikilink">universe is open</a> (<a href="Omega#The_symbol_Ω_(majuscule_letter)" title="wikilink">Ω<sub>0</sub></a> ≤ 1), then he will wander, lost in space, forever. The dramatic tension in the story derives from the mid-course detection of a minuscule divergence from dead-straight, the deduction of the cause, the putative correction, and the unpredictable denouement of the voyage. As he sets out, Chiram aims his ship for and soon passes by Deneb: "Dead ahead was Deneb—the line of their way around the universe."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> As one of the most distant of the sky's prominent stars, Deneb serves as a stable beacon for firmly locking in unchanging bearings on the crucial first leg of the journey.</li>
<li>"A Place in the Sun" (1956), short story written by Milton S. Lesser as by <a href="Stephen_Marlowe" title="wikilink">Stephen Marlowe</a>, published in <em><a href="Amazing_Stories" title="wikilink">Amazing Stories</a></em>. The <em>elan</em> (personality essence) of Galactic Federation special agent Johnny Mayhem is instantaneously transmitted from Canopus to Deneb City on <strong>Deneb IV</strong>—the site of recent civil disturbances—where the usual dead body is waiting for him in cold storage. But there's a mixup, and instead he comes to under a cold shower on a spaceship that is plunging straight toward a fiery annihilation in the Sun. He turns off the needle spray. He dries himself off. He ponders his options...</li>
<li>"<a href="The_Feeling_of_Power" title="wikilink">The Feeling of Power</a>" (1958), short story by <a href="Isaac_Asimov" title="wikilink">Isaac Asimov</a>. The Terrestrial Federation is at war with Deneb, and it depends on hand-held devices startlingly similar to the <a href="Calculator#Pocket_calculators" title="wikilink">digital pocket calculators</a> that would be unavailable until after 1971, more than a dozen years after Asimov's prescient story. In the tale, humans have long since forgotten how to perform even the most elementary arithmetic by hand until Myron Aub, a low grade Technician, notices certain recurring patterns in the output of his apparatus—and proceeds to figure out and share the underlying algorithms and methods. The idea catches on, and the newfound ability of humans to perform calculations on their own revolutionizes the Federation and the war, as men rediscover the "feeling of power" inherent in spontaneous reckoning. Asimov would later substantially abandon using any real star names such as Deneb in his stories.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></li>
<li>"<a href="Mack_Reynolds#Short_stories" title="wikilink">I'm a Stranger Here Myself</a>" (1960), short story by <a href="Mack_Reynolds" title="wikilink">Mack Reynolds</a>, published in <em><a href="Amazing_Stories" title="wikilink">Amazing Stories</a></em>. So, a couple of aliens walk into a bar... Conversation ensues. <em>"I felt your mind probe back a few minutes ago ... Telepathy is a sense not trained by the humanoids. If they had it, your job—and mine—would be considerably more difficult. Let's face it, in spite of these human bodies we're disguised in, neither of us is humanoid. Where are you really from, Rupert?"/ "Aldebaran," I said. "How about you?"/ "<strong>Deneb</strong>," he told me, shaking. We had a laugh and ordered another beer. "What're you doing here on Earth?" I asked him./ "Researching for one of our meat trusts. We're protein eaters. Humanoid flesh is considered quite a delicacy. How about you?"/ "Scouting the place for thrill tourists. My job is to go around to these backward cultures and help stir up inter-tribal, or international, conflicts—all according to how advanced they are."</em></li>
<li>"<a href="The_Machine_that_Won_the_War" title="wikilink">The Machine that Won the War</a>" (1961), short story by <a href="Isaac_Asimov" title="wikilink">Isaac Asimov</a>. This story, also involving war with Deneb, exploits a theme similar to that of Asimov's "Feeling of Power": human versus machine capabilities, and the ultimate superiority of mankind's native unaugmented intelligence.</li>
<li><em><a href="Roadside_Picnic" title="wikilink">Roadside Picnic</a></em> (1972), short Russian-language novel by <a href="Arkady_and_Boris_Strugatsky" title="wikilink">Arkady and Boris Strugatsky</a> (<em>English trans 1977</em>). Aliens from the star Deneb visit the Earth and sojourn briefly in six areas that subsequently become known as the Visitation Zones. Such zones exhibit strange and dangerous phenomena not understood by humans, and contain artifacts with inexplicable, seemingly supernatural properties—possibly the analogs of "picnic refuse," carelessly discarded by the Denebians. The tale narrates the adventures of a fraternity of plunderers who make a living looting artifacts from the Zones—not infrequently with discomfiting results.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></li>
<li><em><a href="Hyperion_(Simmons_novel)" title="wikilink">Hyperion</a></em> (1989), first novel in the <em><a href="Hyperion_Cantos" title="wikilink">Hyperion Cantos</a></em> series by <a href="Dan_Simmons" title="wikilink">Dan Simmons</a>. Humanity has spread across the galaxy, and makes profligate, casual use of <em>farcaster</em> technology to travel instantly between any two points in space (to its ultimate rue). The eponymous <em>Hyperion Cantos</em> is an epic poem written by the character Martin Silenus.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In his own words, "... My "few weeks to polish up the <em>Cantos</em> turned into ten months of obsessive labor. I shut off most of the rooms in the house, keeping only the tower room on <strong>Deneb Drei</strong>, the exercise room on Lusus, the kitchen, and the bathroom raft on Mare Infinitus..."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Deneb Drei (Deneb III, in German) and <strong>Deneb Vier</strong> (Deneb IV) are inhabited planets in the Deneb system, just two of dozens of richly detailed planets featured in the single novel that by itself would make Dan Simmons one of the half-dozen central science fiction figures of the 1980s.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></li>

He is somehow able to contact the Rowan telepathically across some 1600 light-years of space, informing her that his homeworld is under attack by aliens of the bug-like Hive. She warns Earth Prime, who doesn't credit the alarum until Jeff contrives a convincing—and fearsome—practical demonstration.

Peeples</a>. The powerful—and dangerous—newly minted telepath Gary Mitchell reminisces with his old friend Captain Kirk about a wild shore leave they once spent together on <strong>Deneb IV</strong>, a planet of paranormal adepts, where he had already displayed high psychic potential. Mitchell embellishes his side of the account with the tale of an intense romantic encounter with a Denebian woman he describes as a "nova."

The USS <em>Enterprise</em> is hijacked by a mysterious android and taken to an unnamed planet, populated by hundreds of thousands of his fellows, and by one Harcourt Fenton Mudd, a hapless con-man known to Captain Kirk. The androids, assisted by Harry Mudd, plot to commandeer the <em>Enterprise</em>, take over the galaxy, and control—and serve—humanity forever in a sort of cosmic nanny state. The crew of the <em>Enterprise</em> overcome their robotic captors by using the classic ruse of beguiling them with paradoxes, but not before Mr. Spock has occasion to remind Mudd of the penalty for fraud on <strong>Deneb V</strong>: capital punishment, with the means freely chosen by the condemned.

The USS <em>Enterprise</em> pulls into Deep Space Station K7 where trouble immediately starts with the crew of a Klingon battle cruiser on shore leave, and the <em>Enterprise</em> suffers an infestation of tribbles, adorable balls of fluff that multiply without bound and eat everything in sight. Things go from bad to worse, as Korax, the Klingon first officer, calls Captain Kirk a <strong>Denebian</strong> slime devil and the tribbles all die of an unknown cause—later revealed to be the unintended consequence of a Klingon plot.</li>

Captain Picard and the crew of the newly built <em>USS Enterprise-D</em> examine the mysterious <em>Farpoint Station</em> in orbit around <strong>Deneb IV</strong>, which the enigmatic Bandi are offering to the Federation—all as he labors under the judgmental gaze of a powerful alien entity that calls itself Q. At Farpoint, Picard wants to fire on a mysterious hostile craft, but is warned off by Q, so he sends an <em><a href="Star_Trek:_Away_Team#Overview" title="wikilink">away team</a></em> instead. Mysteries multiply as the team, the crew, and Picard discover that the station is both more and less than it seems, but the enigma is finally resolved and everything is put to rights, to the apparent—if temporary—satisfaction of Q.</li>
