<h1>Ting-Chao Chou</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Ting-Chao Chou</strong> (born 1938 in Taiwan, Chinese name: 周廷潮) is a Chinese American theoretical biologist, pharmacologist, cancer researcher and inventor. His 273 scientific articles have been cited in 15,149 papers in over 545 biomedical journals as of April 2, 2014.[1] He derived the median-effect equation (MEE) from the physico-chemical principle of the mass-action law, and introduced the median-effect plot in 1976.[2] With <a href="Paul_Talalay" title="wikilink">Paul Talalay</a> of the <a href="Johns_Hopkins_University_School_of_Medicine" title="wikilink">Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine</a>, he derived the combination index equation (CIE) for multiple drug effect interactions, and introduced the concept of combination index (CI) for quantitative definition of synergism (CI1) using computerized simulations.[3] One original article in Advances in Enzyme Regulation 22:27-55, 1984 by Chou-Talalay on CI has been cited 2,859 times internationally in a broad spectrum of journals.[1] Integration of MEE and CIE resulted in Econo-Green bioresearch and new drug development.[4] This integrated theory and algorithms allow conducting small number of data points, conservation of laboratory animals and reducing the number of patients in clinical trials. Consequently, this allows saving time and cost and resources as well as increasing efficiency an effectiveness in medical, pharmaceutical research and new drug development.[4] With colleagues, T.C. Chou is inventor/co-inventor of 35 U.S. Patents, mainly for anticancer agents.[5]</p>
<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>

<p>Born in Chang-Gang Village, Hu-Kao Township, Hsin-chu County, Taiwan on September 9, 1938 (Father, Chao-Yun Chou; Mother, Sheng-Mei Chen).</p>
<h3 id="ancestry">Ancestry</h3>

<p>His birthplace is Chou family’s ancestral hall with a large insigne on the center “濓溪第:” (The Lianxi Place), “汝南堂” (Rue-nan Tarn), listing the family tree for about 250 years. “Chou (Zhou) Lianxi” is Chou Dunyi’s posthumous name. Chou Dunyi (1017-1073) ( 周敦頤 ) was a Neo-Confucian philosopher and cosmologist of the Northern Song Dynasty. His brief essay On Praising Lotus Flower (愛蓮說) was recited by many hundred millions of school children since it was selected in the standard high school textbook in both mainland China and Taiwan. T.C. Chou is an eighth generation descendant of the Hakka Stream moving from Zhaozhou in Guangdong to Taiwan during the years of Yung-Zhen Emperor of Ching Dynasty in 1750s.</p>
<h3 id="education">Education</h3>

<p>Under the Japan’s rule of Taiwan 1895-1945, the Chou family established a private family school teaching Chinese characters and classics. His father was the teacher. After his father died, the widowed mother sent him to Hsin-Chu Normal School affiliated primary school with three hour round-trip daily commute in the sixth grade. After the Provincial Hsin-Chu High School, he entered Kaohsiung Medical University School of Pharmacy where he graduated summa cum laude. He was accepted by the Pharmacological Institute of National Taiwan University College of Medicine and received the master's degree under the mentorship of Chen-Yuan Lee, Director of the Institute, and Dean of the Medical School. In 1965, he received the Gibbs Scholarship from Yale University where he devoted to the mathematical aspects of quantitative biology. He received Ph.D. degree with high honors under the mentorship of Professor Robert E. Hanschumacher. He did postdoctoral fellowship at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine under Chairman of the Pharmacology Department, Paul Talalay, for two years, 1970-1972. In 1972 he joined Laboratory of Pharmacology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in New York City as an Assistant Professor, affiliated to Cornell University Graduate School of Medical Sciences. He became a Member and Professor in 1988. After 40 years of service at MSKCC, he retired on June 1, 2013 from the Directorship of Preclinical Pharmacology Core Laboratory, Molecular Pharmacology &amp; Chemistry Program of MSKCC.</p>

<h3 id="the-median-effect-equation">The Median-Effect Equation</h3>

<p>The median-effect equation(MEE) of the mass-action law was delivered by Chou in 1974 through the derivation of over 300 rate equations of enzyme dynamics, followed by mathematical induction and deduction The ratio of the fraction affected (fa) vs the fraction unaffected (fu) is equal to the dose (D) vs the median-effect dose (Dm) to the mth power, where Dm signifies potency and m signifies the sigmodicity (shape) of the dose-effect curve.[2] This median-effect equation, i.e. (fa)/(fu)=[(D)/(Dm)]<sup>m</sup> where fa + fu = 1, is the unified form for the Michaelis-Menten equation for enzyme substrate saturation, the Hill equation for ligand occupancy at high order, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for pH ionization, and the Scatchard equation for the receptor binding. Thus, the half-affected (Dm) is equivalent to half-saturated (Km), the half-occupied (K), half-ionized (pK) and half-bound and half-free (Kd). MEE is the simplest possible form for all the above equations in biochemistry and biophysics. The “median” is the common-link for single and multiple ligand interactions, and the universal reference point for the first-order and higher order dynamics.[3]</p>
<h3 id="the-median-effect-plot">The Median-Effect Plot</h3>

<p>Also introduced by Chou in 1976 was the median-effect plot which is a plot of log (D) vs log [(fa)/(1-fa)] or log [(fa)/(fu)] yields a straight line with slope (m) and the x-intercept of log (Dm), where Dm equals to the anti-log of the x-intercept. This unique theory holds true for all dose-effect curves that follows the physico-chemical principle of the mass-action law, for all entities regardless of the first-order or higher-order dynamics, and regardless of unit or mechanism of actions.[3] MEE is derived by system analysis using enzyme kinetics and mathematical inductions and deductions where hundreds of mechanism specific individual equations are reduced to a single general equation. [3] Both left and right sides of the MEE are dimensionless quantities. When the m and Dm are determined, the full dose-effect curve is defined. Since the median-effect plot yields straight lines, the theoretical minimum of only two data points allow the drawing of the full dose-effect curve, when the effect is accurately determined. This fundamental revelation defies the common held belief that two data points cannot draw a defined does-effect curve.</p>
<h3 id="the-combination-index-theorem">The Combination Index Theorem</h3>

<p>The combination index (CI) concept was introduced by Chou T.C. and Talalay P. during 1983-84[3] The derived combination index equation for two drugs is:</p>

<h3 id="the-combination-index-plot">The Combination Index Plot</h3>

<p>Based on the above MEE and CI algorithms, a plot of CI values at different effect levels (fa’s) can be determined by computer simulation (e.g. CompuSyn or CalcuSyn software, www. Combosyn.com, free download). Entering a series of "dose (D) and effect (fa)" into computer for each drug alone and their combinations, the software will automatically simulate the CI values at different fa levels in seconds, based on the CI algorithm. This plot is also called the Fa-CI plot or the Chou-Talalay plot.[6] Depending on the experimental design, the combination mixtures can be at constant ratio or at non-constant ratios. The CI equations for three or more drug combinations have also been derived[3] and can be subjected to computer simulation.[6]</p>

<p>The CI theorem is developed for drugs (or effectors) regardless of mechanism of actions, and regardless of dynamic orders and or the units of each drug in the combination.[3] The method has been applied in the combination of anti-cancer drugs, anti-HIV agents, drug-radiation, and traditional Chinese herbal medicines.[1]</p>
<h3 id="the-isobolograms">The Isobolograms</h3>

<p>The idea of isobologram, i.e. the equi-effective curve at various concentrations or doses of two drugs, has been around for a century. However, only until 1984 the formal derivation of its equation in the general form was introduced by Chou and Talalay. The isobol equation is just a special case of the CI equation.[3] Thus automated computerized construction of either the classic isobologram (at constant ratio combinations) or the normalized isobologram (at non-constant ratio combination) can be performed in seconds using CompuSyn software.[6] In addition, the isobol method is now amendable for three or more drug combinations. Both Fa-CI plot and isobologram yield identical conclusion of synergism or antagonism. The Fa-CI plot is effect-oriented whereas isobol is dose-oriented. Both graphics can be considered two-sides of the same coin. However, Fa-CI plot is visually more convenient to use than isobologram since data point over crowding in isobologram at various effect levels can be avoided.</p>
<h3 id="the-dose-reduction-index-dri">The Dose-Reduction Index (DRI)</h3>

<p>The DRI is a measure of how many folds the dose of each drug in a synergistic combination may be reduced, at a given effect level, compared with the doses of each drug alone.[3] The inverted terms in the CI equation, are the DRIs for the corresponding individual drugs in the combination. The reduced dose which will reduce toxicity at the increased effect would lead to beneficial clinical consequences. The algorithm and computerized simulation of the DRI plot at different effect levels (i.e. the Fa-DRI plot or Chou-Martin plot) has been available using the CompuSyn software.[6] DRI=1 indicates no dose reduction, whereas DRI&gt;1 and </p>
