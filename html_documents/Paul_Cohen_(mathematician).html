<h1>Paul Cohen (mathematician)</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Paul Joseph Cohen</strong> (April 2, 1934 – March 23, 2007)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> was an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a class="uri" href="mathematician" title="wikilink">mathematician</a>. He is best known for his proof of the <a href="independence_(mathematical_logic)" title="wikilink">independence</a> of the <a href="continuum_hypothesis" title="wikilink">continuum hypothesis</a> and the <a href="axiom_of_choice" title="wikilink">axiom of choice</a> from <a href="Zermelo–Fraenkel_set_theory" title="wikilink">Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory</a>, for which he was awarded a <a href="Fields_Medal" title="wikilink">Fields Medal</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-years">Early years</h2>

<p>Cohen was born in <a href="Long_Branch,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Long Branch, New Jersey</a>, into a <a class="uri" href="Jewish" title="wikilink">Jewish</a> family that had immigrated to the United States from what is now <a class="uri" href="Poland" title="wikilink">Poland</a>; he grew up in <a class="uri" href="Brooklyn" title="wikilink">Brooklyn</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> He graduated in 1950, at age 16, from <a href="Stuyvesant_High_School" title="wikilink">Stuyvesant High School</a> in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Cohen next studied at the <a href="Brooklyn_College" title="wikilink">Brooklyn College</a> from 1950 to 1953, but he left before earning his <a href="bachelor's_degree" title="wikilink">bachelor's degree</a> when he learned that he could start his graduate studies at the <a href="University_of_Chicago" title="wikilink">University of Chicago</a> with just two years of college. At <a class="uri" href="Chicago" title="wikilink">Chicago</a>, Cohen completed his <a href="master's_degree" title="wikilink">master's degree</a> in <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a> in 1954 and his <a href="Doctor_of_Philosophy" title="wikilink">Doctor of Philosophy</a> degree in 1958, under supervision of the Professor of Mathematics, <a href="Antoni_Zygmund" title="wikilink">Antoni Zygmund</a>. The title of his doctoral thesis was <em>Topics in the Theory of Uniqueness of Trigonometrical Series</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="contributions-to-mathematics">Contributions to mathematics</h2>

<p>Cohen is noted for developing a mathematical technique called <strong><a href="forcing_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">forcing</a></strong>, which he used to prove that neither the <a href="continuum_hypothesis" title="wikilink">continuum hypothesis</a> (CH), nor the <a href="axiom_of_choice" title="wikilink">axiom of choice</a>, can be proved from the standard <a href="Zermelo–Fraenkel_axioms" title="wikilink">Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms</a> (ZF) of <a href="set_theory" title="wikilink">set theory</a>. In conjunction with the earlier work of <a href="Kurt_Gödel" title="wikilink">Gödel</a>, this showed that both of these statements are <a href="logical_independence" title="wikilink">logically independent</a> of the ZF axioms: these statements can be neither proved nor disproved from these axioms. In this sense, the continuum hypothesis is undecidable, and it is the most widely known example of a natural statement that is independent from the standard ZF axioms of set theory.</p>

<p>For his result on the continuum hypothesis, Cohen won the <a href="Fields_Medal" title="wikilink">Fields Medal</a> in mathematics in 1966, and also the <a href="National_Medal_of_Science" title="wikilink">National Medal of Science</a> in 1967.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The Fields Medal that Cohen won continues to be the only Fields Medal to be awarded for a work in mathematical logic, as of 2014.</p>

<p>Apart from his work in set theory, Cohen also made many valuable contributions to analysis. He was awarded the <a href="Bôcher_Memorial_Prize" title="wikilink">Bôcher Memorial Prize</a> in <a href="mathematical_analysis" title="wikilink">mathematical analysis</a> in 1964 for his paper "On a conjecture by <a href="John_Edensor_Littlewood" title="wikilink">Littlewood</a> and <a href="idempotent_measure" title="wikilink">idempotent measures</a>", and lends his name to the <a href="Cohen-Hewitt_factorization_theorem" title="wikilink">Cohen-Hewitt factorization theorem</a>.</p>

<p>Cohen was a full professor of mathematics at <a href="Stanford_University" title="wikilink">Stanford University</a>, where he supervised <a href="Peter_Sarnak" title="wikilink">Peter Sarnak</a>'s graduate research, among those of other students.</p>

<p><a href="Angus_MacIntyre" title="wikilink">Angus MacIntyre</a> of the <a href="University_of_London" title="wikilink">University of London</a> stated about Cohen: "He was dauntingly clever, and one would have had to be naive or exceptionally altruistic to put one's 'hardest problem' to the Paul I knew in the '60s." He went on to compare Cohen to <a href="Kurt_Gödel" title="wikilink">Kurt Gödel</a>, saying: "Nothing more dramatic than their work has happened in the history of the subject."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Gödel himself wrote a letter to Cohen in 1963, a draft of which stated, "Let me repeat that it is really a delight to read your proof of the ind[ependence] of the cont[inuum] hyp[othesis]. I think that in all essential respects you have given the best possible proof &amp; this does not happen frequently. Reading your proof had a similarly pleasant effect on me as seeing a really good play."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="on-the-continuum-hypothesis">On the continuum hypothesis</h2>

<p>While studying the continuum hypothesis, Cohen is quoted as saying in 1985 that he had "had the feeling that people thought the problem was hopeless, since there was no new way of constructing models of set theory. Indeed, they thought you had to be slightly crazy even to think about the problem."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>"A point of view which the author [Cohen] feels may eventually come to be accepted is that CH is obviously false. The main reason one accepts the <a href="axiom_of_infinity" title="wikilink">axiom of infinity</a> is probably that we feel it absurd to think that the process of adding only one set at a time can exhaust the entire universe. Similarly with the higher axioms of infinity. Now

 as an incredibly rich set given to us by one bold new axiom, which can never be approached by any piecemeal process of construction. Perhaps later generations will see the problem more clearly and express themselves more eloquently."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>An "enduring and powerful product" of Cohen's work on the continuum hypothesis, and one that has been used by "countless mathematicians"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> is known as <a href="forcing_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">"forcing"</a>, and it is used to construct mathematical models to test a given hypothesis for truth or falsehood.</p>

<p>Shortly before his death, Cohen gave a lecture describing his solution to the problem of the continuum hypothesis at the Gödel centennial conference, in Vienna in 2006. A video of this lecture is now available online.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
