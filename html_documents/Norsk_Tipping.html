<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Football pools were the only game when the Norsk Tipping AS was founded in 1948. At that time organisation was run as a limited company with the Norwegian State holding 40%, the Norwegian Sports Federation 40% and the Norwegian Football Association 20%. The profit was at first shared between sports and research projects. Today the company also raises money for culture causes, and the surplus is divided 50/50 between sports and culture.</p>

<p>In 1993 the Norwegian State took full ownership over the company.</p>

<p>Norsk Tipping’s website was established in 1999 with results service and daily updating of the information for players. In 2001 after the page was tested Norsk Tipping started to offer its products on the Internet.</p>

<li>4 correct numbers + at least 1 additional number</li>
</ol>

In the event that nobody had seven correct numbers, this portion of the prize fund is carried over to next week's draw.</p>
