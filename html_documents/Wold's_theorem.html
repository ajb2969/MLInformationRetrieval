<h1>Wold's theorem</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In <a class="uri" href="statistics" title="wikilink">statistics</a>, <strong>Wold's decomposition</strong> or the <strong>Wold representation theorem</strong> (not to be confused with the Wold theorem that is the discrete-time analog of the <a href="Wiener–Khinchine_theorem" title="wikilink">Wiener–Khinchine theorem</a>) named after <a href="Herman_Wold" title="wikilink">Herman Wold</a>, says that every <a href="stationary_process" title="wikilink">covariance-stationary</a> <a href="time_series" title="wikilink">time series</a> <span class="LaTeX">$Y_{t}$</span> can be written as the sum of two time series, one <em>deterministic</em> and one <em>stochastic</em>.</p>
<p>Formally</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$Y_t=\sum_{j=0}^\infty b_j \varepsilon_{t-j}+\eta_t,$$</span></p>
<p>where:</p>
<p>:*<span class="LaTeX">$Y_t \,$</span> is the <a href="time_series" title="wikilink">time series</a> being considered,</p>
<p>:*<span class="LaTeX">$\varepsilon_t$</span> is an uncorrelated sequence which is the <a href="Innovation_(signal_processing)" title="wikilink">innovation process</a> to the process <span class="LaTeX">$Y_t \,$</span> – that is, a white noise process that is input to the linear filter <span class="LaTeX">$\{b_j \}$</span>.</p>
<p>:*<span class="LaTeX">$b \,$</span> is the <em>possibly</em> infinite vector of moving average weights (coefficients or parameters)</p>
<p>:*<span class="LaTeX">$\eta_t \,$</span> is a deterministic time series, such as one represented by a sine wave.</p>
<p>Note that the moving average coefficients have these properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stable, that is square summable <span class="LaTeX">$\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}|b_{j}|^2$</span> \infty</li>
<li>Causal (i.e. there are no terms with <em>j</em> < 0)</li>
<li>Minimum delay</li>
<li>Constant (<span class="LaTeX">$b_j$</span> independent of <em>t</em>)</li>
<li>It is conventional to define <span class="LaTeX">$b_0 = 1$</span></li>
</ol>
<p>This theorem can be considered as an existence theorem: any stationary process has this seemingly special representation. Not only is the existence of such a simple linear and exact representation remarkable, but even more so is the special nature of the moving average model. Imagine creating a process that is a moving average but not satisfying these properties 1–4. For example, the coefficients <span class="LaTeX">$b_j$</span> could define an acausal and non-minimum delay model. Nevertheless the theorem assures the existence of a causal minimum delay moving average that exactly represents this process. How this all works for the case of causality and the minimum delay property is discussed in Scargle (1981), where an extension of the Wold Decomposition is discussed.</p>
<p>The usefulness of the Wold Theorem is that it allows the <a href="dynamical_system" title="wikilink">dynamic</a> evolution of a variable <span class="LaTeX">$Y_{t}$</span> to be approximated by a <a href="linear_model" title="wikilink">linear model</a>. If the innovations <span class="LaTeX">$\varepsilon_{t}$</span> are <a href="statistical_independence" title="wikilink">independent</a>, then the linear model is the only possible representation relating the observed value of <span class="LaTeX">$Y_{t}$</span> to its past evolution. However, when <span class="LaTeX">$\varepsilon_{t}$</span> is merely an <a class="uri" href="uncorrelated" title="wikilink">uncorrelated</a> but not independent sequence, then the linear model exists but it is not the only representation of the dynamic dependence of the series. In this latter case, it is possible that the linear model may not be very useful, and there would be a nonlinear model relating the observed value of <span class="LaTeX">$Y_{t}$</span> to its past evolution. However, in practical <a href="time_series_analysis" title="wikilink">time series analysis</a>, it is often the case that only linear predictors are considered, partly on the grounds of simplicity, in which case the Wold decomposition is directly relevant.</p>
<p>The Wold representation depends on an infinite number of parameters, although in practice they usually decay rapidly. The <a href="autoregressive_model" title="wikilink">autoregressive model</a> is an alternative that may have only a few coefficients if the corresponding moving average has many. These two models can be combined into an <a href="Autoregressive_moving_average_model" title="wikilink">autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) model</a>, or an autoregressive-integrated-moving average (ARIMA) model if non-stationarity is involved.
