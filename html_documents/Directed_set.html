<h1>Directed set</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, a <strong>directed set</strong> (or a <strong>directed preorder</strong> or a <strong>filtered set</strong>) is a nonempty <a href="Set_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">set</a> <em>A</em> together with a <a href="reflexive_relation" title="wikilink">reflexive</a> and <a href="transitive_relation" title="wikilink">transitive</a> <a href="binary_relation" title="wikilink">binary relation</a> ≤ (that is, a <a class="uri" href="preorder" title="wikilink">preorder</a>), with the additional property that every pair of elements has an <a href="upper_bound" title="wikilink">upper bound</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In other words, for any <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> in <em>A</em> there must exist a <em>c</em> in <em>A</em> with <em>a</em> ≤ <em>c</em> and <em>b</em> ≤ <em>c</em>.</p>
<p>The notion defined above is sometimes called an <strong>upward directed set</strong>. A <strong>downward directed set</strong> is defined analogously,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> meaning when every doubleton is bounded below.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Some authors (and this article) assume that a directed set is directed upward, unless otherwise stated. Beware that other authors call a set directed if and only if it is directed both upward and downward.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Directed sets are a generalization of nonempty <a href="totally_ordered_set" title="wikilink">totally ordered sets</a>, that is, all totally ordered sets are directed sets (contrast <a href="partially_ordered_sets" title="wikilink"><em>partially</em> ordered sets</a> which need not be directed). Join <a href="semilattice" title="wikilink">semilattices</a> (which are partially ordered sets) are directed sets as well, but not conversely. Likewise, <a href="Lattice_(order)" title="wikilink">lattices</a> are directed sets both upward and downward.</p>
<p>In <a class="uri" href="topology" title="wikilink">topology</a>, directed sets are used to define <a href="net_(topology)" title="wikilink">nets</a>, which generalize <a href="sequence" title="wikilink">sequences</a> and unite the various notions of <a href="limit_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">limit</a> used in <a href="mathematical_analysis" title="wikilink">analysis</a>. Directed sets also give rise to <a href="direct_limit" title="wikilink">direct limits</a> in <a href="abstract_algebra" title="wikilink">abstract algebra</a> and (more generally) <a href="category_theory" title="wikilink">category theory</a>.</p>
<h2 id="equivalent-definition">Equivalent definition</h2>
<p>In addition to the definition above, there is an equivalent definition. A <strong>directed set</strong> is a set <em>A</em> with a preorder such that every finite subset of <em>A</em> has an upper bound. In this definition, the existence of an upper bound of the <a href="empty_set" title="wikilink">empty subset</a> implies that <em>A</em> is nonempty.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>Examples of directed sets include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The set of <a href="natural_number" title="wikilink">natural numbers</a> <strong>N</strong> with the ordinary order ≤ is a directed set (and so is every <a href="total_order" title="wikilink">totally ordered set</a>).</li>
<li>Let <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong> be directed sets. Then the Cartesian product set <strong>D<sub>1</sub> <span class="LaTeX">$\times$</span> D<sub>2</sub></strong> can be made into a directed set by defining (<em>n</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>n</em><sub>2</sub>) ≤ (<em>m</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>m</em><sub>2</sub>) if and only if <em>n</em><sub>1</sub> ≤ <em>m</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>n</em><sub>2</sub> ≤ <em>m</em><sub>2</sub>. In analogy to the <a href="product_order" title="wikilink">product order</a> this is the product direction on the Cartesian product.</li>
<li>It follows from previous example that the set <strong>N</strong> <span class="LaTeX">$\times$</span> <strong>N</strong> of pairs of natural numbers can be made into a directed set by defining (<em>n</em><sub>0</sub>, <em>n</em><sub>1</sub>) ≤ (<em>m</em><sub>0</sub>, <em>m</em><sub>1</sub>) if and only if <em>n</em><sub>0</sub> ≤ <em>m</em><sub>0</sub> and <em>n</em><sub>1</sub> ≤ <em>m</em><sub>1</sub>.</li>
<li>If <em>x</em><sub>0</sub> is a <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real number</a>, we can turn the set <strong>R</strong> − {<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>} into a directed set by writing <em>a</em> ≤ <em>b</em> if and only if<br/>
|<em>a</em> − <em>x</em><sub>0</sub>| ≥ |<em>b</em> − <em>x</em><sub>0</sub>|. We then say that the reals have been <em>directed towards x<sub>0</sub></em>. This is an example of a directed set that is not <a href="partial_order" title="wikilink">ordered</a> (neither totally nor partially).</li>
<li>A (trivial) example of a partially ordered set that is <strong><em>not</em></strong> directed is the set {<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>}, in which the only order relations are <em>a</em> ≤ <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> ≤ <em>b</em>. A less trivial example is like the previous example of the "reals directed towards x<sub>0</sub>" but in which the ordering rule only applies to pairs of elements on the same side of x<sub>0</sub>.</li>
<li>If <em>T</em> is a <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topological space</a> and <em>x</em><sub>0</sub> is a point in <em>T</em>, we turn the set of all <a href="topological_neighbourhood" title="wikilink">neighbourhoods</a> of <em>x</em><sub>0</sub> into a directed set by writing <em>U</em> ≤ <em>V</em> if and only if <em>U</em> contains <em>V</em>.
<ul>
<li>For every <em>U</em>: <em>U</em> ≤ <em>U</em>; since <em>U</em> contains itself.</li>
<li>For every <em>U</em>,<em>V</em>,<em>W</em>: if <em>U</em> ≤ <em>V</em> and <em>V</em> ≤ <em>W</em>, then <em>U</em> ≤ <em>W</em>; since if <em>U</em> contains <em>V</em> and <em>V</em> contains <em>W</em> then <em>U</em> contains <em>W</em>.</li>
<li>For every <em>U</em>, <em>V</em>: there exists the set <em>U</em> <span class="LaTeX">$\cap$</span> <em>V</em> such that <em>U</em> ≤ <em>U</em> <span class="LaTeX">$\cap$</span> <em>V</em> and <em>V</em> ≤ <em>U</em> <span class="LaTeX">$\cap$</span> <em>V</em>; since both <em>U</em> and <em>V</em> contain <em>U</em> <span class="LaTeX">$\cap$</span> <em>V</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In a <a class="uri" href="poset" title="wikilink">poset</a> <em>P</em>, every lower closure of an element, i.e. every subset of the form {<em>a</em>| <em>a</em> in <em>P</em>, <em>a</em> ≤<em>x</em>} where <em>x</em> is a fixed element from <em>P</em>, is directed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Directed sets are a more general concept than (join) semilattices: every <a href="semilattice" title="wikilink">join semilattice</a> is a directed set, as the join or least upper bound of two elements is the desired <em>c</em>. The converse does not hold however, witness the directed set {1000,0001,1101,1011,1111} <a href="coordinatewise_order" title="wikilink">ordered bitwise</a> (e.g. 1000 ≤ 1011 holds, but 0001 ≤ 1000 does not, since in the last bit 1 > 0), where {1000,0001} has three upper bounds but no <em>least</em> upper bound, cf. picture. (Also note that without 1111, the set is not directed.)</p>
<h2 id="directed-subsets">Directed subsets</h2>
<p>The order relation in a directed sets is not required to be <a href="antisymmetric_relation" title="wikilink">antisymmetric</a>, and therefore directed sets are not always <a href="partial_order" title="wikilink">partial orders</a>. However, the term <em>directed set</em> is also used frequently in the context of posets. In this setting, a subset <em>A</em> of a partially ordered set (<em>P</em>,≤) is called a <strong>directed subset</strong> if it is a directed set according to the same partial order: in other words, it is not the <a href="empty_set" title="wikilink">empty set</a>, and every pair of elements has an upper bound. Here the order relation on the elements of <em>A</em> is inherited from <em>P</em>; for this reason, reflexivity and transitivity need not be required explicitly.</p>
<p>A directed subset of a poset is not required to be <a href="lower_set" title="wikilink">downward closed</a>; a subset of a poset is directed if and only if its downward closure is an <a href="ideal_(order_theory)" title="wikilink">ideal</a>. While the definition of a directed set is for an "upward-directed" set (every pair of elements has an upper bound), it is also possible to define a downward-directed set in which every pair of elements has a common lower bound. A subset of a poset is downward-directed if and only if its upper closure is a <a href="filter_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">filter</a>.</p>
<p>Directed subsets are used in <a href="domain_theory" title="wikilink">domain theory</a>, which studies <a href="directed_complete_partial_order" title="wikilink">directed complete partial orders</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> These are posets in which every upward-directed set is required to have a <a href="least_upper_bound" title="wikilink">least upper bound</a>. In this context, directed subsets again provide a generalization of convergent sequences.</p>
