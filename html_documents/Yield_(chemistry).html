<h1>Yield (chemistry)</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In <a class="uri" href="chemistry" title="wikilink">chemistry</a>, <strong>yield</strong>, also referred to as <strong>reaction yield</strong>, is the <a href="amount_of_substance" title="wikilink">amount</a> of <a href="Product_(chemistry)" title="wikilink">product</a> obtained in a <a href="chemical_reaction" title="wikilink">chemical reaction</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The <strong>absolute yield</strong> can be given as the weight in <a href="gram" title="wikilink">grams</a> or in <a href="Mole_(unit)" title="wikilink">moles</a> (<strong>molar yield</strong>). The <strong>percentage yield</strong> (or <strong>fractional yield</strong> or <strong>relative yield</strong>), which serves to measure the effectiveness of a <a href="Chemical_synthesis" title="wikilink">synthetic procedure</a>, is calculated by dividing the amount of the desired product obtained by the <strong>theoretical yield</strong> (the unit of measure for both must be the same):</p>
<center>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$\mbox{percent yield} = \frac{\mbox{actual yield}}{\mbox{theoretical yield}} \times 100%$</span></p>
</center>
<p>The theoretical yield is the amount predicted by a <a href="stoichiometry" title="wikilink">stoichiometric</a> calculation based on the number of moles of all reactants present. This calculation assumes that only one reaction occurs and that the <a href="limiting_reactant" title="wikilink">limiting reactant</a> reacts completely. However the actual yield is very often smaller (the percent yield is less than 100%) for several reasons:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Many reactions are incomplete and the reactants are not completely converted to products. If a reverse reaction occurs, the final state contains both reactants and products in a state of <a href="chemical_equilibrium" title="wikilink">chemical equilibrium</a>.</li>
<li>Two or more reactions may occur simultaneously, so that some reactant is converted to undesired by-products.</li>
<li>Losses occur in the separation and purification of the desired product from the reaction mixture.</li>
<li>Impurities are present which do not react</li>
</ul>
<p>The ideal or <em>theoretical yield</em> of a chemical reaction would be 100%. According to Vogel's Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry, yields around 100% are called <em>quantitative</em>, yields above 90% are called <em>excellent</em>, yields above 80% are <em>very good</em>, yields above 70% are <em>good</em>, yields above 50% are <em>fair</em>, and yields below 40% are called <em>poor</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> It should however be noted that these names are arbitrary and not universally accepted, and for many reactions these expectations may be unrealistically high. Yields may appear to be above 100% when products are impure, as the measured weight of the product will include the weight of any impurities.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Purification steps always lower the yield and the reported yields usually refer to the yield of the final purified product.</p>
<p>When more than one reactant participates in a reaction, the yield is usually calculated based on the amount of the <a href="limiting_reactant" title="wikilink">limiting reactant</a>, whose amount is less than <a href="stoichiometry" title="wikilink">stoichiometrically</a> equivalent (or just equivalent) to the amounts of all other reactants present. Other reagents present in amounts greater than required to react with all the limiting reagent present are considered excess. As a result the yield should not be automatically taken as a measure for reaction efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>This is an example of an <a class="uri" href="esterification" title="wikilink">esterification</a> reaction where one molecule <a href="acetic_acid" title="wikilink">acetic acid</a> reacts with one molecule <a class="uri" href="ethanol" title="wikilink">ethanol</a>, yielding one molecule <a href="ethyl_acetate" title="wikilink">ethyl acetate</a> (a bimolecular <a href="Order_(chemistry)" title="wikilink">second-order</a> reaction of the type A + B → C):</p>
<dl>
<dd>120 g <strong>acetic acid</strong> (60 g/mol, 2.0 mol) was reacted with 230 g <strong>ethanol</strong> (46 g/mol, 5.0 mol), yielding 132 g <strong>ethyl acetate</strong> (88 g/mol, 1.5 mol). The yield was 75%.
</dd>

<ol>
<li>The <em>molar amount</em> of the reactants is calculated from the weights (acetic acid: 120 g ÷ 60 g/mol = 2.0 mol; ethanol: 230 g ÷ 46 g/mol = 5.0 mol).</li>
<li>Ethanol is used in a 2.5-fold excess (5.0 mol ÷ 2.0 mol).</li>
<li>The <em>theoretical molar yield</em> is 2.0 mol (the molar amount of the limiting compound, acetic acid).</li>
<li>The <em>molar yield</em> of the product is calculated from its weight (132 g ÷ 88 g/mol = 1.5 mol).</li>
<li>The <em>% yield</em> is calculated from the actual <em>molar yield</em> and the <em>theoretical molar yield</em> (1.5 mol ÷ 2.0 mol × 100% = 75%).</li>
