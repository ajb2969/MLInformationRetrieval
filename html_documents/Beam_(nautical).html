<h1>Beam (nautical)</h1>
<hr/>

<p> The <strong>beam</strong> of a ship is its width at the widest point as measured at the ship's nominal <a class="uri" href="waterline" title="wikilink">waterline</a>. The beam is a bearing projected at right-angles from the fore and aft line, outwards from the widest part of ship. Beam may also be used to define the maximum width of a ship's hull, or maximum width plus superstructure overhangs.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the wider the beam of a ship (or boat), the more <a href="initial_stability" title="wikilink">initial stability</a> it has, at expense of <a href="reserve_stability" title="wikilink">reserve stability</a> in the event of a <a href="capsizing" title="wikilink">capsize</a>, where more energy is required to right the vessel from its inverted position.</p>
<h2 id="typical-values">Typical values</h2>

<p>Typical length-to-beam ratios for small sailboats are from 2:1 (dinghies to trailerable sailboats around ) to 5:1 (racing sailboats over ).</p>

<p>Large ships have widely varying beam ratios, some as large as 20:1.</p>

<p><a href="Racing_shell" title="wikilink">Rowing shells</a> designed for flatwater racing may have length to beam ratios as high as 30:1,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> while a <a class="uri" href="coracle" title="wikilink">coracle</a> has a ratio of almost 1:1 – it is nearly circular.</p>
<h2 id="formula">Formula</h2>

<p>The beam of many monohull vessels can be calculated using the following formula:</p>

</math>

 Where LOA is Length Overall and all units are in feet.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a standard  yacht: the cube root of 27 is 3, 3 squared is 9 plus 1 = 10. The beam of many 27 ft monohulls is .</li>
<li>For a <a href="Volvo_Open_70" title="wikilink">Volvo Open 70</a> yacht: 70.5 to the power of 2/3 = 17 plus 1 = 18. The beam is often around .</li>
<li>For a  long ship: the cube root is 9, and 9 squared is 81, plus 1. The beam will usually be around , e.g. <a class="uri" href="Seawaymax" title="wikilink">Seawaymax</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>As catamarans have more than one hull, there is a different beam calculation for this kind of vessel.</p>
<h2 id="boc">BOC</h2>

<p>BOC stands for Beam On Centerline. This term in typically used in conjunction with LOA (Length overall). The ratio of LOA/BOC is used to estimate the stability of multihull vessels. The lower the ratio the greater the boat's stability.</p>

<p>The BOC for vessels is measured as follows: For a catamaran: the perpendicular distance from the centerline of one hull to the centerline of the other hull, measured at deck level. For a trimaran: the perpendicular distance between the centerline of the main hull and the centerline of either ama, measured at deck level</p>
<h2 id="other-beams">Other beams</h2>

<p>Other meanings of 'beam' in the nautical context are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beam</strong> – a timber similar in use to a floor joist, which runs from one side of the hull to the other athwartships.</li>
<li><strong>Carlin</strong> – similar to a beam, except running in a fore and aft direction.</li>
