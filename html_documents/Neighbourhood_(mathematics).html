<h1>Neighbourhood (mathematics)</h1>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>In <a class="uri" href="topology" title="wikilink">topology</a> and related areas of <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, a <strong>neighbourhood</strong> (or <strong>neighborhood</strong>) is one of the basic concepts in a <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topological space</a>. Intuitively speaking, a neighbourhood of a point is a <a href="Set_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">set</a> containing the point where one can move that point some amount without leaving the set.</p>
<p>This concept is closely related to the concepts of <a href="open_set" title="wikilink">open set</a> and <a href="interior_(topology)" title="wikilink">interior</a>.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>If <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span> is a <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topological space</a> and <span class="LaTeX">$p$</span> is a point in <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span>, a <strong>neighbourhood</strong> of <span class="LaTeX">$p$</span> is a <a class="uri" href="subset" title="wikilink">subset</a> <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> of <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span> that includes an <a href="open_set" title="wikilink">open set</a> <span class="LaTeX">$U$</span> containing <span class="LaTeX">$p$</span>,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$p \in U \subseteq V.$$</span></p>
<p>This is also equivalent to <span class="LaTeX">$p\in X$</span> being in the <a href="Interior_(topology)#Interior_point" title="wikilink">interior</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span>.</p>
<p>Note that the neighbourhood <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> need not be an open set itself. If <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> is open it is called an <strong>open neighbourhood</strong>. Some <a href="scholar" title="wikilink">scholars</a> require that neighbourhoods be open, so it is important to note conventions.</p>
<p>A set that is a neighbourhood of each of its points is open since it can be expressed as the union of open sets containing each of its points.</p>
<p>The collection of all neighbourhoods of a point is called the <a href="neighbourhood_system" title="wikilink">neighbourhood system</a> at the point.</p>
<p>If <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span> is a <a class="uri" href="subset" title="wikilink">subset</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span> then a <strong>neighbourhood</strong> of <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span> is a set <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> that includes an open set <span class="LaTeX">$U$</span> containing <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span>. It follows that a set <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> is a neighbourhood of <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span> if and only if it is a neighbourhood of all the points in <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span>. Furthermore, it follows that <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> is a neighbourhood of <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span> <a class="uri" href="iff" title="wikilink">iff</a> <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span> is a subset of the <a href="Interior_(topology)" title="wikilink">interior</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span>.</p>
<h2 id="in-a-metric-space">In a metric space</h2>
<p>  In a <a href="metric_space" title="wikilink">metric space</a> <span class="LaTeX">$M = (X, d)$</span>, a set <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> is a <strong>neighbourhood</strong> of a point <span class="LaTeX">$p$</span> if there exists an <a href="open_ball" title="wikilink">open ball</a> with centre <span class="LaTeX">$p$</span> and radius <span class="LaTeX">$r>0$</span>, such that</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$B_r(p) = B(p;r) = \{ x \in X \mid d(x,p) < r \}$$</span> is contained in <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span>.</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> is called <strong>uniform neighbourhood</strong> of a set <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span> if there exists a positive number <span class="LaTeX">$r$</span> such that for all elements <span class="LaTeX">$p$</span> of <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span>,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$B_r(p) = \{ x \in X \mid d(x,p) < r \}$$</span> is contained in <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span>.</p>
<p>For <span class="LaTeX">$r > 0$</span> the <strong><span class="LaTeX">$r$</span>-neighbourhood</strong> <span class="LaTeX">$S_r$</span> of a set <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span> is the set of all points in <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span> that are at distance less than <span class="LaTeX">$r$</span> from <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span> (or equivalently, <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span><sub><span class="LaTeX">$r$</span></sub> is the union of all the open balls of radius <span class="LaTeX">$r$</span> that are centred at a point in <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span>).</p>
<p>It directly follows that an <span class="LaTeX">$r$</span>-neighbourhood is a uniform neighbourhood, and that a set is a uniform neighbourhood if and only if it contains an <span class="LaTeX">$r$</span>-neighbourhood for some value of <span class="LaTeX">$r$</span>.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p> Given the set of <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real numbers</a> <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbb{R}$</span> with the usual <a href="Euclidean_metric" title="wikilink">Euclidean metric</a> and a subset <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> defined as</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$V:=\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} B\left(n\,;\,1/n \right),$$</span> then <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> is a neighbourhood for the set <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbb{N}$</span> of <a href="natural_number" title="wikilink">natural numbers</a>, but is <em>not</em> a uniform neighbourhood of this set.</p>
<h2 id="topology-from-neighbourhoods">Topology from neighbourhoods</h2>
<p>The above definition is useful if the notion of <a href="open_set" title="wikilink">open set</a> is already defined. There is an alternative way to define a topology, by first defining the <a href="neighbourhood_system" title="wikilink">neighbourhood system</a>, and then open sets as those sets containing a neighbourhood of each of their points.</p>
<p>A neighbourhood system on <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span> is the assignment of a <a href="filter_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">filter</a> <span class="LaTeX">$N(x)$</span> (on the set <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span>) to each <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span>, such that</p>
<ol>
<li>the point <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> is an element of each <span class="LaTeX">$U$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$N(x)$</span></li>
<li>each <span class="LaTeX">$U$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$N(x)$</span> contains some <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$N(x)$</span> such that for each <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$U$</span> is in <span class="LaTeX">$N(y)$</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>One can show that both definitions are compatible, i.e. the topology obtained from the neighbourhood system defined using open sets is the original one, and vice versa when starting out from a neighbourhood system.</p>
<h2 id="uniform-neighbourhoods">Uniform neighbourhoods</h2>
<p>In a <a href="uniform_space" title="wikilink">uniform space</a> <span class="LaTeX">$S = (X, \delta)$</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> is called a <strong>uniform neighbourhood</strong> of <span class="LaTeX">$P$</span> if <span class="LaTeX">$P$</span> is not <a href="closeness_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">close</a> to <span class="LaTeX">$X \setminus V$</span>, that is there exists no <a href="entourage_(topology)" title="wikilink">entourage</a> containing <span class="LaTeX">$P$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$X \setminus V$</span>.</p>
<h2 id="deleted-neighbourhood">Deleted neighbourhood</h2>
<p>A <strong>Deleted neighbourhood</strong> of a point <span class="LaTeX">$p$</span> (sometimes called a <strong>punctured neighbourhood</strong>) is a neighbourhood of <span class="LaTeX">$p$</span>, without <span class="LaTeX">$\{p\}$</span>. For instance, the <a href="interval_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">interval</a> <span class="LaTeX">$(-1, 1) = \{y : -1 < y < 1\}$</span> is a neighbourhood of <span class="LaTeX">$p = 0$</span> in the <a href="real_line" title="wikilink">real line</a>, so the set <span class="LaTeX">$(-1, 0) \cup (0, 1) = (-1, 1) \setminus \{0\}$</span> is a deleted neighbourhood of <span class="LaTeX">$0$</span>. Note that a deleted neighbourhood of a given point is not in fact a neighbourhood of the point. The concept of deleted neighbourhood occurs in the <a href="Limit_of_a_function#Functions_on_topological_spaces" title="wikilink">definition of the limit of a function</a>.</p>
