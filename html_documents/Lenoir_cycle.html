<p>The <strong>Lenoir cycle</strong> is an idealized <a href="thermodynamic_cycle" title="wikilink">thermodynamic cycle</a> often used to model a <a href="pulse_jet_engine" title="wikilink">pulse jet engine</a>. It is based on the operation of an engine patented by <a href="Jean_Joseph_Etienne_Lenoir" title="wikilink">Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir</a> in 1860. This engine is often thought of as the first commercially produced <a href="internal_combustion_engine" title="wikilink">internal combustion engine</a>. The absence of any compression process in the design leads to lower <a href="thermal_efficiency" title="wikilink">thermal efficiency</a> than the more well known <a href="Otto_cycle" title="wikilink">Otto cycle</a> and <a href="Diesel_cycle" title="wikilink">Diesel cycle</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-cycle">The cycle</h2>
<p>In the cycle, an <a href="ideal_gas" title="wikilink">ideal gas</a> undergoes<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<dl>
<dd>1-2: Constant volume (<a href="wikt:isochoric" title="wikilink">isochoric</a>) heat addition;
</dd>
<dd>2-3: <a href="Isentropic_process" title="wikilink">Isentropic</a> expansion;
</dd>
<dd>3-1: Constant pressure (<a href="isobaric_process" title="wikilink">isobaric</a>) heat rejection—compression to the volume at the start of the cycle.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The expansion process is <a href="isentropic_process" title="wikilink">isentropic</a> and hence involves no heat interaction. Energy is absorbed as heat during the isochoric heating and rejected as work during the isentropic expansion. Waste heat is rejected during the isobaric cooling which consumes some work.</p>
<h3 id="constant-volume-heat-addition-1-2">Constant volume heat addition (1-2)</h3>
<p>In the ideal gas version of the traditional Lenoir cycle, the first stage (1-2) involves the addition of heat in a constant volume manner. This results in the following for the first law of thermodynamics: <span class="LaTeX">${}_1Q_2  = mc_v \left( {T_2  - T_1 } \right)$</span></p>
<p>There is no work during the process because the volume is held constant: <span class="LaTeX">${}_1W_2  = \int\limits_1^2 {pdV}  = 0$</span></p>
<p>and from the definition of constant volume specific heats for an ideal gas: <span class="LaTeX">$c_v  = \frac{R}{{\gamma  - 1}}$</span></p>
<p>Where <em>R</em> is the ideal gas constant and <em>γ</em> is the ratio of specific heats (approximately 287 J/(kg·K) and 1.4 for air respectively). The pressure after the heat addition can be calculated from the ideal gas law<span class="LaTeX">$$p_2 V_2  = RT_2$$</span></p>
<h3 id="isentropic-expansion-2-3">Isentropic expansion (2-3)</h3>
<p>The second stage (2-3) involves a reversible adiabatic expansion of the fluid back to its original pressure. It can be determined for an isentropic process that the second law of thermodynamics results in the following: <span class="LaTeX">$\frac{{T_2}}{{T_3}} = \left( {\frac{{p_2}}{{p_3}}} \right)^{{\textstyle{{\gamma  - 1} \over \gamma }}}  = \left( {\frac{{V_3}}{{V_2}}} \right)^{\gamma  - 1}$</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="LaTeX">$p_3 = p_1$</span> for this specific cycle. The first law of thermodynamics results in the following for this expansion process<span class="LaTeX">$${}_2W_3  = mc_v \left( {T_2  - T_3 } \right)$$</span> because for an adiabatic process: <span class="LaTeX">${}_2 Q_3  = 0$</span></p>
<h3 id="constant-pressure-heat-rejection-3-1">Constant pressure heat rejection (3-1)</h3>
<p>The final stage (3-1) involves a constant pressure heat rejection back to the original state. From the first law of thermodynamics we find<span class="LaTeX">$${}_3Q_1  - _3 W_1  = U_1  - U_3$$</span>.</p>
<p>From the definition of work<span class="LaTeX">$${}_3W_1  = \int\limits_3^1 {pdV}  = p_1 \left( {V_1  - V_3 } \right)$$</span>, we recover the following for the heat rejected during this process<span class="LaTeX">$${}_3Q_1  = \left( {U_1  + p_1 V_1 } \right) - \left( {U_3  + p_3 V_3 } \right) = H_1  - H_3$$</span>.</p>
<p>As a result, we can determine the heat rejected as follows<span class="LaTeX">$${}_3Q_1  = mc_p \left( {T_1  - T_3 } \right)$$</span> from the definition of constant pressure specific heats for an ideal gas<span class="LaTeX">$$c_p  = \frac{{\gamma R}}
{{\gamma  - 1}}$$</span>.</p>
<p>The overall efficiency of the cycle is determined by the total work over the heat input, which for a Lenoir cycle equals <span class="LaTeX">$\eta _{th}  = \frac{{{}_2W_3  + {}_3W_1 }}
{{{}_1Q_2 }}$</span>. Note that we gain work during the expansion process but lose some during the heat rejection process.</p>
