<h1>Order theory</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Order theory</strong> is a branch of <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a> which investigates our intuitive notion of order using <a href="binary_relation" title="wikilink">binary relations</a>. It provides a formal framework for describing statements such as "this is less than that" or "this precedes that". This article introduces the field and provides basic definitions. A list of order-theoretic terms can be found in the <a href="order_theory_glossary" title="wikilink">order theory glossary</a>.</p>
<h2 id="background-and-motivation">Background and motivation</h2>

<p>Orders are everywhere in mathematics and related fields like <a href="computer_science" title="wikilink">computer science</a>. The first order often discussed in <a href="primary_school" title="wikilink">primary school</a> is the standard order on the <a href="natural_numbers" title="wikilink">natural numbers</a> e.g. "2 is less than 3", "10 is greater than 5", or "Does Tom have fewer cookies than Sally?". This intuitive concept can be extended to orders on other sets of <a href="number" title="wikilink">numbers</a>, such as the <a href="integer" title="wikilink">integers</a> and the <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">reals</a>. The idea of being greater than or less than another number is one of the basic intuitions of <a href="number_systems" title="wikilink">number systems</a> (compare with <a href="numeral_systems" title="wikilink">numeral systems</a>) in general (although one usually is also interested in the actual <a href="Subtraction" title="wikilink">difference</a> of two numbers, which is not given by the order). Another familiar example of an ordering is the <a href="lexicographic_order" title="wikilink">lexicographic order</a> of words in a dictionary.</p>

<p>The above types of orders have a special property: each element can be <em>compared</em> to any other element, i.e. it is greater, smaller, or equal. However, this is not always a desired requirement. For example, consider the <a class="uri" href="subset" title="wikilink">subset</a> ordering of <a href="Set_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">sets</a>. If a set <em>A</em> contains all the elements of a set <em>B</em>, then <em>B</em> is said to be smaller than or equal to <em>A</em>. Yet there are some sets that cannot be related in this fashion. Whenever both contain some elements that are not in the other, the two sets are not related by subset-inclusion. Hence, subset-inclusion is only a <em><a href="partial_order" title="wikilink">partial order</a></em>, as opposed to the <em><a href="total_order" title="wikilink">total orders</a></em> given before.</p>

<p>Order theory captures the intuition of orders that arises from such examples in a general setting. This is achieved by specifying properties that a relation ≤ must have to be a mathematical order. This more abstract approach makes much sense, because one can derive numerous theorems in the general setting, without focusing on the details of any particular order. These insights can then be readily transferred to many less abstract applications.</p>

<p>Driven by the wide practical usage of orders, numerous special kinds of ordered sets have been defined, some of which have grown into mathematical fields of their own. In addition, order theory does not restrict itself to the various classes of ordering relations, but also considers appropriate <a href="function_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">functions</a> between them. A simple example of an order theoretic property for functions comes from <a href="Functional_analysis" title="wikilink">analysis</a> where <a href="Monotonic_function" title="wikilink">monotone</a> functions are frequently found.</p>
<h2 id="basic-definitions">Basic definitions</h2>

<p>This section introduces ordered sets by building upon the concepts of <a href="set_theory" title="wikilink">set theory</a>, <a class="uri" href="arithmetic" title="wikilink">arithmetic</a>, and <a href="binary_relation" title="wikilink">binary relations</a>.</p>
<h3 id="partially-ordered-sets">Partially ordered sets</h3>

<p>Orders are special binary relations. Suppose that <em>P</em> is a set and that ≤ is a relation on <em>P</em>. Then ≤ is a <strong>partial order</strong> if it is <a href="reflexive_relation" title="wikilink">reflexive</a>, <a href="antisymmetric_relation" title="wikilink">antisymmetric</a>, and <a href="transitive_relation" title="wikilink">transitive</a>, i.e., for all <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> and <em>c</em> in <em>P</em>, we have that:</p>
<dl>
<dd><em>a</em> ≤ <em>a</em> (reflexivity)
</dd>
<dd>if <em>a</em> ≤ <em>b</em> and <em>b</em> ≤ <em>a</em> then <em>a</em> = <em>b</em> (antisymmetry)
</dd>
<dd>if <em>a</em> ≤ <em>b</em> and <em>b</em> ≤ <em>c</em> then <em>a</em> ≤ <em>c</em> (transitivity).
</dd>
</dl>

<p>A set with a <a href="partially_ordered_set" title="wikilink">partial order</a> on it is called a <strong>partially ordered set</strong>, <strong>poset</strong>, or just an <strong>ordered set</strong> if the intended meaning is clear. By checking these properties, one immediately sees that the well-known orders on <a href="natural_number" title="wikilink">natural numbers</a>, <a href="integer" title="wikilink">integers</a>, <a href="rational_number" title="wikilink">rational numbers</a> and <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">reals</a> are all orders in the above sense. However, they have the additional property of being <strong><a href="total_order" title="wikilink">total</a></strong>, i.e., for all <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> in <em>P</em>, we have that:</p>
<dl>
<dd><em>a</em> ≤ <em>b</em> or <em>b</em> ≤ <em>a</em> (totality).
</dd>
</dl>

<p>These orders can also be called <strong>linear orders</strong> or <strong>chains</strong>. While many classical orders are linear, the <a class="uri" href="subset" title="wikilink">subset</a> order on sets provides an example where this is not the case. Another example is given by the divisibility relation "|". For two natural numbers <em>n</em> and <em>m</em>, we write <em>n</em>|<em>m</em> if <em>n</em> <a href="division_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">divides</a> <em>m</em> without remainder. One easily sees that this yields a partial order. The identity relation = on any set is also a partial order in which every two distinct elements are incomparable. It is also the only relation that is both a partial order and an <a href="equivalence_relation" title="wikilink">equivalence relation</a>. Many advanced properties of posets are interesting mainly for non-linear orders.</p>
<h3 id="visualizing-a-poset">Visualizing a poset</h3>

<p> <a href="Hasse_diagram" title="wikilink">Hasse diagrams</a> can visually represent the elements and relations of a partial ordering. These are <a href="graph_drawing" title="wikilink">graph drawings</a> where the <a href="vertex_(graph_theory)" title="wikilink">vertices</a> are the elements of the poset and the ordering relation is indicated by both the <a href="graph_theory" title="wikilink">edges</a> and the relative positioning of the vertices. Orders are drawn bottom-up: if an element <em>x</em> is smaller than (precedes) <em>y</em> then there exists a path from <em>x</em> to <em>y</em> that is directed upwards. It is often necessary for the edges connecting elements to cross each other, but elements must never be located within an edge. An instructive exercise is to draw the Hasse diagram for the set of natural numbers that are smaller than or equal to 13, ordered by | (the <em><a href="Divisor" title="wikilink">divides</a></em> relation).</p>

<p>Even some infinite sets can be diagrammed by superimposing an <a class="uri" href="ellipsis" title="wikilink">ellipsis</a> (...) on a finite sub-order. This works well for the natural numbers, but it fails for the reals, where there is no immediate successor above 0; however, quite often one can obtain an intuition related to diagrams of a similar kind.</p>
<h3 id="special-elements-within-an-order">Special elements within an order</h3>

<p>In a partially ordered set there may be some elements that play a special role. The most basic example is given by the <strong>least element</strong> of a <a class="uri" href="poset" title="wikilink">poset</a>. For example, 1 is the <a href="least_element" title="wikilink">least element</a> of the positive integers and the <a href="empty_set" title="wikilink">empty set</a> is the least set under the subset order. Formally, an element <em>m</em> is a least element if:</p>
<dl>
<dd><em>m</em> ≤ <em>a</em>, for all elements <em>a</em> of the order.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The notation 0 is frequently found for the least element, even when no numbers are concerned. However, in orders on sets of numbers, this notation might be inappropriate or ambiguous, since the number 0 is not always least. An example is given by the above divisibility order |, where 1 is the least element since it divides all other numbers. In contrast, 0 is the number that is divided by all other numbers. Hence it is the <strong>greatest element</strong> of the order. Other frequent terms for the least and greatest elements is <strong>bottom</strong> and <strong>top</strong> or <strong>zero</strong> and <strong>unit</strong>.</p>

<p>Least and <a href="greatest_element" title="wikilink">greatest elements</a> may fail to exist, as the example of the real numbers shows. But if they exist, they are always unique. In contrast, consider the divisibility relation | on the set {2,3,4,5,6}. Although this set has neither top nor bottom, the elements 2, 3, and 5 have no elements below them, while 4, 5, and 6 have none above. Such elements are called <strong>minimal</strong> and <strong>maximal</strong>, respectively. Formally, an element <em>m</em> is <a href="minimal_element" title="wikilink">minimal</a> if:</p>
<dl>
<dd><em>a</em> ≤ <em>m</em> implies <em>a</em> = <em>m</em>, for all elements <em>a</em> of the order.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Exchanging ≤ with ≥ yields the definition of <a href="maximal_element" title="wikilink">maximality</a>. As the example shows, there can be many maximal elements and some elements may be both maximal and minimal (e.g. 5 above). However, if there is a least element, then it is the only minimal element of the order. Again, in infinite posets maximal elements do not always exist - the set of all <em>finite</em> subsets of a given infinite set, ordered by subset inclusion, provides one of many counterexamples. An important tool to ensure the existence of maximal elements under certain conditions is <strong><a href="Zorn's_Lemma" title="wikilink">Zorn's Lemma</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Subsets of partially ordered sets inherit the order. We already applied this by considering the subset {2,3,4,5,6} of the natural numbers with the induced divisibility ordering. Now there are also elements of a poset that are special with respect to some subset of the order. This leads to the definition of <strong><a href="upper_bound" title="wikilink">upper bounds</a></strong>. Given a subset <em>S</em> of some poset <em>P</em>, an upper bound of <em>S</em> is an element <em>b</em> of <em>P</em> that is above all elements of <em>S</em>. Formally, this means that</p>
<dl>
<dd><em>s</em> ≤ <em>b</em>, for all <em>s</em> in <em>S</em>.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Lower bounds again are defined by inverting the order. For example, -5 is a lower bound of the natural numbers as a subset of the integers. Given a set of sets, an upper bound for these sets under the subset ordering is given by their <a href="union_(set_theory)" title="wikilink">union</a>. In fact, this upper bound is quite special: it is the smallest set that contains all of the sets. Hence, we have found the <strong><a href="least_upper_bound" title="wikilink">least upper bound</a></strong> of a set of sets. This concept is also called <strong>supremum</strong> or <strong>join</strong>, and for a set <em>S</em> one writes sup(<em>S</em>) or v<em>S</em> for its least upper bound. Conversely, the <strong><a href="greatest_lower_bound" title="wikilink">greatest lower bound</a></strong> is known as <strong><a class="uri" href="infimum" title="wikilink">infimum</a></strong> or <strong>meet</strong> and denoted inf(<em>S</em>) or ^<em>S</em>. These concepts play an important role in many applications of order theory. For two elements <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, one also writes <em>x</em> v <em>y</em> and <em>x</em> ^ <em>y</em> for sup({<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>}) and inf({<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>}), respectively.</p>

<p>For another example, consider again the relation | on natural numbers. The least upper bound of two numbers is the smallest number that is divided by both of them, i.e. the <a href="least_common_multiple" title="wikilink">least common multiple</a> of the numbers. Greatest lower bounds in turn are given by the <a href="greatest_common_divisor" title="wikilink">greatest common divisor</a>.</p>
<h3 id="duality">Duality</h3>

<p>In the previous definitions, we often noted that a concept can be defined by just inverting the ordering in a former definition. This is the case for "least" and "greatest", for "minimal" and "maximal", for "upper bound" and "lower bound", and so on. This is a general situation in order theory: A given order can be inverted by just exchanging its direction, pictorially flipping the Hasse diagram top-down. This yields the so-called <strong>dual</strong>, <strong>inverse</strong>, or <strong>opposite order</strong>.</p>

<p>Every order theoretic definition has its dual: it is the notion one obtains by applying the definition to the inverse order. Since all concepts are symmetric, this operation preserves the theorems of partial orders. For a given mathematical result, one can just invert the order and replace all definitions by their duals and one obtains another valid theorem. This is important and useful, since one obtains two theorems for the price of one. Some more details and examples can be found in the article on <a href="duality_(order_theory)" title="wikilink">duality in order theory</a>.</p>
<h3 id="constructing-new-orders">Constructing new orders</h3>

<p>There are many ways to construct orders out of given orders. The dual order is one example. Another important construction is the <a href="cartesian_product" title="wikilink">cartesian product</a> of two partially ordered sets, taken together with the <a href="product_order" title="wikilink">product order</a> on pairs of elements. The ordering is defined by (<em>a</em>, <em>x</em>) ≤ (<em>b</em>, <em>y</em>) if (and only if) <em>a</em> ≤ <em>b</em> and <em>x</em> ≤ <em>y</em>. (Notice carefully that there are three distinct meanings for the relation symbol ≤ in this definition.) The <a href="disjoint_union" title="wikilink">disjoint union</a> of two posets is another typical example of order construction, where the order is just the (disjoint) union of the original orders.</p>

<p>Every partial order ≤ gives rise to a so-called <a href="strict_order" title="wikilink">strict order</a>  are posets <em>S</em> having a unique bottom element <em>0∈S</em>, along with an order-reversing involution, such that

.</p>

<p>However, one can go even further: if all finite non-empty infima exist, then ∧ can be viewed as a total binary operation in the sense of <a href="universal_algebra" title="wikilink">universal algebra</a>. Hence, in a lattice, two operations ∧ and ∨ are available, and one can define new properties by giving identities, such as</p>
<dl>
<dd><em>x</em> ∧ (<em>y</em> ∨ <em>z</em>)  =  (<em>x</em> ∧ <em>y</em>) ∨ (<em>x</em> ∧ <em>z</em>), for all <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em>.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>This condition is called <strong>distributivity</strong> and gives rise to <a href="distributive_lattice" title="wikilink">distributive lattices</a>. There are some other important distributivity laws which are discussed in the article on <a href="distributivity_(order_theory)" title="wikilink">distributivity in order theory</a>. Some additional order structures that are often specified via algebraic operations and defining identities are</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Heyting_algebra" title="wikilink">Heyting algebras</a> and</li>
<li><a href="Boolean_algebra_(structure)" title="wikilink">Boolean algebras</a>,</li>
</ul>

<p>which both introduce a new operation ~ called <strong>negation</strong>. Both structures play a role in <a href="mathematical_logic" title="wikilink">mathematical logic</a> and especially Boolean algebras have major applications in <a href="computer_science" title="wikilink">computer science</a>. Finally, various structures in mathematics combine orders with even more algebraic operations, as in the case of <a href="quantale" title="wikilink">quantales</a>, that allow for the definition of an addition operation.</p>

<p>Many other important properties of posets exist. For example, a poset is <strong>locally finite</strong> if every closed <a href="interval_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">interval</a> [<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>] in it is <a href="finite_set" title="wikilink">finite</a>. Locally finite posets give rise to <a href="incidence_algebra" title="wikilink">incidence algebras</a> which in turn can be used to define the <a href="Euler_characteristic#Generalizations" title="wikilink">Euler characteristic</a> of finite bounded posets.</p>
<h2 id="subsets-of-ordered-sets">Subsets of ordered sets</h2>

<p>In an ordered set, one can define many types of special subsets based on the given order. A simple example are <strong>upper sets</strong>; i.e. sets that contain all elements that are above them in the order. Formally, the <strong>upper closure</strong> of a set <em>S</em> in a poset <em>P</em> is given by the set {<em>x</em> in <em>P</em> | there is some <em>y</em> in <em>S</em> with <em>y</em> ≤ <em>x</em>}. A set that is equal to its upper closure is called an upper set. <strong>Lower sets</strong> are defined dually.</p>

<p>More complicated lower subsets are <a href="ideal_(order_theory)" title="wikilink">ideals</a>, which have the additional property that each two of their elements have an upper bound within the ideal. Their duals are given by <a href="filter_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">filters</a>. A related concept is that of a <a href="directed_set" title="wikilink">directed subset</a>, which like an ideal contains upper bounds of finite subsets, but does not have to be a lower set. Furthermore it is often generalized to preordered sets.</p>

<p>A subset which is - as a sub-poset - linearly ordered, is called a <a href="total_order#Chains" title="wikilink">chain</a>. The opposite notion, the <a class="uri" href="antichain" title="wikilink">antichain</a>, is a subset that contains no two comparable elements; i.e. that is a discrete order.</p>
<h2 id="related-mathematical-areas">Related mathematical areas</h2>

<p>Although most mathematical areas <em>use</em> orders in one or the other way, there are also a few theories that have relationships which go far beyond mere application. Together with their major points of contact with order theory, some of these are to be presented below.</p>
<h3 id="universal-algebra">Universal algebra</h3>

<p>As already mentioned, the methods and formalisms of <a href="universal_algebra" title="wikilink">universal algebra</a> are an important tool for many order theoretic considerations. Beside formalizing orders in terms of algebraic structures that satisfy certain identities, one can also establish other connections to algebra. An example is given by the correspondence between <a href="Boolean_algebra_(structure)" title="wikilink">Boolean algebras</a> and <a href="Boolean_ring" title="wikilink">Boolean rings</a>. Other issues are concerned with the existence of free constructions, such as <em>free lattices</em> based on a given set of generators. Furthermore, closure operators are important in the study of universal algebra.</p>
<h3 id="topology">Topology</h3>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="topology" title="wikilink">topology</a> orders play a very prominent role. In fact, the set of <a href="open_set" title="wikilink">open sets</a> provides a classical example of a complete lattice, more precisely a complete <a href="Heyting_algebra" title="wikilink">Heyting algebra</a> (or "<strong>frame</strong>" or "<strong>locale</strong>"). <a href="filter_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">Filters</a> and <a href="net_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">nets</a> are notions closely related to order theory and the <a href="closed_set" title="wikilink">closure operator of sets</a> can be used to define topology. Beyond these relations, topology can be looked at solely in terms of the open set lattices, which leads to the study of <a href="pointless_topology" title="wikilink">pointless topology</a>. Furthermore, a natural preorder of elements of the underlying set of a topology is given by the so-called <a href="specialization_order" title="wikilink">specialization order</a>, that is actually a partial order if the topology is <a href="T0_space" title="wikilink">T<sub>0</sub></a>.</p>

<p>Conversely, in order theory, one often makes use of topological results. There are various ways to define subsets of an order which can be considered as open sets of a topology. Especially, it is interesting to consider topologies on a poset (<em>X</em>, ≤) that in turn induce ≤ as their specialization order. The <em>finest</em> such topology is the <a href="Alexandrov_topology" title="wikilink">Alexandrov topology</a>, given by taking all upper sets as opens. Conversely, the <em>coarsest</em> topology that induces the specialization order is the <a href="upper_topology" title="wikilink">upper topology</a>, having the complements of <a href="ideal_(order_theory)" title="wikilink">principal ideals</a> (i.e. sets of the form {<em>y</em> in <em>X</em> | <em>y</em> ≤ <em>x</em>} for some <em>x</em>) as a <a class="uri" href="subbase" title="wikilink">subbase</a>. Additionally, a topology with specialization order ≤ may be <a href="order_consistent" title="wikilink">order consistent</a>, meaning that their open sets are "inaccessible by directed suprema" (with respect to ≤). The finest order consistent topology is the <a href="Scott_topology" title="wikilink">Scott topology</a>, which is coarser than the Alexandrov topology. A third important topology in this spirit is the <a href="Lawson_topology" title="wikilink">Lawson topology</a>. There are close connections between these topologies and the concepts of order theory. For example, a function preserves directed suprema <a class="uri" href="iff" title="wikilink">iff</a> it is <a href="continuous_function_(topology)" title="wikilink">continuous</a> with respect to the Scott topology (for this reason this order theoretic property is also called <a href="Scott-continuous" title="wikilink">Scott-continuity</a>).</p>
<h3 id="category-theory">Category theory</h3>

<p>The visualization of orders with <a href="Hasse_diagram" title="wikilink">Hasse diagrams</a> has a straightforward generalization: instead of displaying lesser elements <em>below</em> greater ones, the direction of the order can also be depicted by giving directions to the edges of a graph. In this way, each order is seen to be equivalent to a <a href="directed_acyclic_graph" title="wikilink">directed acyclic graph</a>, where the nodes are the elements of the poset and there is a directed path from <em>a</em> to <em>b</em> if and only if <em>a</em> ≤ <em>b</em>. Dropping the requirement of being acyclic, one can also obtain all preorders.</p>

<p>When equipped with all transitive edges, these graphs in turn are just special <a href="category_theory" title="wikilink">categories</a>, where elements are objects and each set of morphisms between two elements is at most singleton. Functions between orders become functors between categories. Interestingly, many ideas of order theory are just concepts of category theory in small. For example, an infimum is just a <a href="product_(category_theory)" title="wikilink">categorical product</a>. More generally, one can capture infima and suprema under the abstract notion of a <a href="limit_(category_theory)" title="wikilink">categorical limit</a> (or <em>colimit</em>, respectively). Another place where categorical ideas occur is the concept of a (monotone) <a href="Galois_connection" title="wikilink">Galois connection</a>, which is just the same as a pair of <a href="adjoint_functor" title="wikilink">adjoint functors</a>.</p>

<p>But category theory also has its impact on order theory on a larger scale. Classes of posets with appropriate functions as discussed above form interesting categories. Often one can also state constructions of orders, like the <a href="product_order" title="wikilink">product order</a>, in terms of categories. Further insights result when categories of orders are found <a href="equivalence_of_categories" title="wikilink">categorically equivalent</a> to other categories, for example of topological spaces. This line of research leads to various <em>representation theorems</em>, often collected under the label of <a href="Stone_duality" title="wikilink">Stone duality</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>As explained before, orders are ubiquitous in mathematics. However, earliest explicit mentionings of partial orders are probably to be found not before the 19th century. In this context the works of <a href="George_Boole" title="wikilink">George Boole</a> are of great importance. Moreover, works of <a href="Charles_Sanders_Peirce" title="wikilink">Charles Sanders Peirce</a>, <a href="Richard_Dedekind" title="wikilink">Richard Dedekind</a>, and <a href="Ernst_Schröder" title="wikilink">Ernst Schröder</a> also consider concepts of order theory. Certainly, there are others to be named in this context and surely there exists more detailed material on the history of order theory.</p>

<p>The term <em>poset</em> as an abbreviation for partially ordered set was coined by <a href="Garrett_Birkhoff" title="wikilink">Garrett Birkhoff</a> in the second edition of his influential book <em>Lattice Theory</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
