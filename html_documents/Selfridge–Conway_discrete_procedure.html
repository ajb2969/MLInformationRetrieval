<h1>Selfridge–Conway discrete procedure</h1>
<hr>The '''Selfridge–Conway procedure''' is a discrete procedure that produces an [[envy-free division]] for three players.<ref name="robertsonwebb13">{{Cite book | isbn = 1568810768 | title = Cake-Cutting Algorithms: Be Fa

Selfridge discovered it in 1960, and told it to <a href="Richard_K._Guy" title="wikilink">Richard Guy</a>, who told it to many people, but Selfridge did not publish it. John Conway discovered it independently in 1993, and also never published it, but the result is attributed to them in a number of books.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> This procedure was the first envy-free discrete procedure devised for three partners, and it paved the way for more advanced procedures for <em>n</em> partners (see <a href="envy-free_division" title="wikilink">envy-free division</a>).</p>

<p>A procedure is envy-free if each recipient believes that (according to its measure) no other recipient has received more than he has. In their solution, the maximal number of cuts in the procedure is five. The pieces are not always contiguous.</p>

<p>Suppose we have three players <strong>P1</strong>, <strong>P2</strong> and <strong>P3</strong>. Where the procedure gives a criterion for a decision it means that criterion gives an optimum choice for the player.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>P1</strong> divides the cake into three pieces he considers of equal size.</li>
<li>Let's call <strong>A</strong> the largest piece according to <strong>P2</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>P2</strong> cuts off a bit of <strong>A</strong> to make it the same size as the second largest. Now <strong>A</strong> is divided into: the trimmed piece <strong>A1</strong> and the trimmings <strong>A2</strong>. Leave the trimmings <strong>A2</strong> to the side for now.
<ul>
<li>If <strong>P2</strong> thinks that the two largest parts are equal (such that no trimming is needed), then each player chooses a part in this order: <strong>P3</strong>, <strong>P2</strong> and finally <strong>P1</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>P3</strong> chooses a piece among <strong>A1</strong> and the two other pieces.</li>
<li><strong>P2</strong> chooses a piece with the limitation that if <strong>P3</strong> didn't choose <strong>A1</strong>, <strong>P2</strong> must choose it.</li>
<li><strong>P1</strong> chooses the last piece leaving just the trimmings <strong>A2</strong> to be divided.</li>
</ol>

<p>It remains to divide the trimmings <strong>A2</strong>. The trimmed piece <strong>A1</strong> has been chosen by either <strong>P2</strong> or <strong>P3</strong>; let's call the player who chose it <strong>PA</strong> and the other player <strong>PB</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>PB</strong> cuts <strong>A2</strong> into three equal pieces.</li>
<li><strong>PA</strong> chooses a piece of <strong>A2</strong> - we name it <strong>A21</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>P1</strong> chooses a piece of <strong>A2</strong> - we name it <strong>A22</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>PB</strong> chooses the last remaining piece of <strong>A2</strong> - we name it <strong>A23</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>

<p>Let's see why the procedure is envy-free. It must be shown that each player believes that no other player received more than he had. Without loss of generality, we can write (see illustration above):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PA</strong> received: <strong>A1</strong> + <strong>A21</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>PB</strong> received: <strong>B</strong> + <strong>A23</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>P1</strong> received: <strong>C</strong> + <strong>A22</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the following analysis "largest" means "largest according to the player":</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PA</strong> received <strong>A1</strong> + <strong>A21</strong>. For him, <strong>A1</strong> ≥ <strong>B</strong> and <strong>A1</strong> ≥ <strong>C</strong>. And he considers his choice <strong>A21</strong> to be the largest piece of <strong>A2</strong>. So no other player received more than he did: <strong>A1</strong> + <strong>A21</strong>  ≥  <strong>B</strong> + <strong>A23</strong>, <strong>C</strong> + <strong>A22</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>PB</strong> received <strong>B</strong> + <strong>A23</strong>. For him, <strong>B</strong> ≥ <strong>A1</strong> and <strong>B</strong> ≥ <strong>C</strong> since he chose <strong>B</strong>. Also, he is the one that cut <strong>A2</strong> in 3 pieces, so for him all those pieces are equal.</li>
<li><strong>P1</strong> received <strong>C</strong> + <strong>A22</strong>. For him, <strong>C</strong> ≥ <strong>A1</strong> and <strong>C</strong> = <strong>B</strong>.
<ul>
<li><strong>P1</strong> believes that <strong>PB</strong> didn't receive more than he did. In other words: <strong>C</strong> + <strong>A22</strong>  ≥ <strong>B</strong> + <strong>A23</strong>. Remember that <strong>P1</strong> chose his piece of <strong>A2</strong> before <strong>PB</strong>, thus <strong>A22</strong>  ≥ <strong>A23</strong> in his view.</li>
<li><strong>P1</strong> believes that <strong>PA</strong> didn't receive more than he had. In other words: <strong>C</strong> + <strong>A22</strong>  ≥ <strong>A1</strong> + <strong>A21</strong>. Remember that for <strong>P1</strong>, <strong>C</strong> is equal to <strong>A</strong> since he cut the cake in the first round. Also, <strong>A</strong> = <strong>A1</strong> + <strong>A2</strong> = <strong>A1</strong> + (<strong>A21</strong> + <strong>A22</strong> + <strong>A23</strong>); therefore <strong>C</strong>  ≥ <strong>A1</strong> + <strong>A21</strong>. (Even if <strong>PA</strong> took the whole <strong>A2</strong> and <strong>P1</strong> did not receive <strong>A22</strong>, <strong>P1</strong> would not envy <strong>PA</strong>.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="generalizations">Generalizations</h2>

<p>Note that if all we want is an envy-free division for <em>a part</em> of the cake (i.e. we allow <a href="free_disposal" title="wikilink">free disposal</a>), then we only need to use the first part of the Selfridge–Conway procedure, i.e.:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>P1</strong> divides the cake into three pieces equal for him;</li>
<li><strong>P2</strong> trims at most one piece such that there are two pieces equal for him;</li>
<li><strong>P3</strong> takes a piece, then <strong>P2</strong>, then <strong>P1</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This guarantees that there is no envy, and additionally each partner receives a value of at least 1/4 the total (since the total number of pieces is 4).</p>

<p>This procedure can be generalized to 4 partners in the following way:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>P1</strong> divides the cake into <strong>5</strong> pieces equal for him;</li>
<li><strong>P2</strong> trims at most <strong>2</strong> pieces, such that there are now <strong>3</strong> pieces equal for him;</li>
<li><strong>P3</strong> trims at most <strong>1</strong> piece, such that there are <strong>2</strong> pieces equal for him;</li>
<li><strong>P4</strong> takes a piece, then <strong>P3</strong>, then <strong>P2</strong>, then <strong>P1</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This guarantees that there is no envy, and additionally each partner receives a value of at least 1/8 the total (since the total number of pieces is 8).</p>

<p>By induction. the procedure can be generalized to <em>n</em> partners, the first one dividing the cake to

<p>We can apply the same procedure again on the remainders. By doing so an infinite number of times, we get an envy-free division of the <em>entire</em> cake.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> A refinement of this infinite procedure yields a finite envy-free division procedure - the <a href="Brams–Taylor_procedure" title="wikilink">Brams–Taylor procedure</a>.</p>
