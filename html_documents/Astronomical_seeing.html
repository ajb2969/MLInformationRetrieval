<p><strong>Astronomical seeing</strong> refers to the blurring and <a href="scintillation_(astrophysics)" title="wikilink">twinkling</a> of astronomical objects such as stars caused by <a href="turbulence" title="wikilink">turbulent mixing</a> in the Earth's atmosphere varying the optical <a href="refractive_index" title="wikilink">refractive index</a>. The <em>astronomical seeing</em> conditions on a given night at a given location describe how much the Earth's atmosphere perturbs the images of stars as seen through a telescope.</p>

<p>The most common seeing measurement is the diameter (or more correctly the <a href="full_width_at_half_maximum" title="wikilink">full width at half maximum</a> or FWHM) of the optical intensity across the <em>seeing disc</em> (the <a href="point_spread_function" title="wikilink">point spread function</a> for imaging through the atmosphere). The FWHM of the point spread function (loosely called seeing disc diameter or "<em>seeing</em>") is a reference to the best possible <a href="angular_resolution" title="wikilink">angular resolution</a> which can be achieved by an <a href="optical_telescope" title="wikilink">optical telescope</a> in a long photographic exposure, and corresponds to the FWHM of the fuzzy blob seen when observing a point-like source (such as a star) through the atmosphere. The size of the seeing disc is determined by the <em>astronomical seeing</em> conditions at the time of the observation. The best conditions give a seeing disk diameter of ~0.4 <a href="Minute_of_arc" title="wikilink">arcseconds</a> and are found at high-altitude observatories on small islands such as <a href="Mauna_Kea_Observatory" title="wikilink">Mauna Kea</a> or <a href="Roque_de_los_Muchachos_Observatory" title="wikilink">La Palma</a>.</p>

<p>Seeing is one of the biggest problems for Earth-based astronomy: while the big <a href="telescope" title="wikilink">telescopes</a> have theoretically milli-arcsecond resolution, the real image will never be better than the average seeing disc during the observation. This can easily mean a factor of 100 between the potential and practical resolution. Starting in the 1990s, new <a href="adaptive_optics" title="wikilink">adaptive optics</a> have been introduced that can help correct for these effects, dramatically improving the resolution of ground based telescopes.</p>

<p>Image:Zeta_bootis_short_exposure.png|Typical short-exposure negative image of a binary star (<a href="Zeta_Boötis" title="wikilink">Zeta Boötis</a> in this case) as seen through atmospheric seeing. Each star should appear as a single <a href="Airy_disk" title="wikilink">Airy pattern</a>, but the atmosphere causes the images of the two stars to break up into two patterns of <em>speckles</em> (one pattern above left, the other below right). The speckles are a little difficult to make out in this image due to the coarse pixel size on the camera used (see the simulated images below for a clearer example). The speckles move around rapidly, so that each star appears as a single fuzzy blob in long exposure images (called a <em>seeing disc</em>). The telescope used had a diameter of about 7r<sub>0</sub> (see definition of r<sub>0</sub> below, and example simulated image through a 7r<sub>0</sub> telescope).</p>
</div>

<p>Astronomical seeing has several effects:</p>
<ol>
<li>It causes the images of <a href="point_source" title="wikilink">point sources</a> (such as stars), which in the absence of atmospheric turbulence would be steady <a href="Airy_disk" title="wikilink">Airy patterns</a> produced by diffraction, to break up into speckle patterns, which change very rapidly with time (the resulting speckled images can be processed using <a href="speckle_imaging" title="wikilink">speckle imaging</a>)</li>
<li>Long exposure images of these changing speckle patterns result in a blurred image of the point source, called a <em>seeing disc</em></li>
<li>The brightness of stars appears to fluctuate in a process known as <a href="scintillation_(astronomy)" title="wikilink">scintillation</a> or twinkling</li>
<li>Atmospheric seeing causes the fringes in an <a href="astronomical_interferometer" title="wikilink">astronomical interferometer</a> to move rapidly</li>
<li>The distribution of atmospheric seeing through the atmosphere (the C<sub>N</sub><sup>2</sup> profile described below) causes the image quality in <a href="adaptive_optics" title="wikilink">adaptive optics</a> systems to degrade the further you look from the location of reference star</li>
</ol>

<p>The effects of atmospheric seeing were indirectly responsible for the belief that there were <a href="Martian_canal" title="wikilink">canals on Mars</a>. In viewing a bright object such as Mars, occasionally a still patch of air will come in front of the planet, resulting in a brief moment of clarity. Before the use of <a href="charge-coupled_device" title="wikilink">charge-coupled devices</a>, there was no way of recording the image of the planet in the brief moment other than having the observer remember the image and draw it later. This had the effect of having the image of the planet be dependent on the observer's memory and preconceptions which led the belief that Mars had linear features.</p>

<p>The effects of atmospheric seeing are qualitatively similar throughout the visible and near <a class="uri" href="infra-red" title="wikilink">infra-red</a> wavebands. At large telescopes the long exposure image resolution is generally slightly higher at longer wavelengths, and the timescale (t<sub>0</sub> - see below) for the changes in the dancing speckle patterns is substantially lower.</p>
<h2 id="measures">Measures</h2>

<p>There are three common descriptions of the astronomical seeing conditions at an observatory:</p>
<ol>
<li>The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the seeing disc</li>
<li>r<sub>0</sub> (the size of a typical "lump" of uniform air within the turbulent atmosphere<ref></ref></li>
</ol>

<p>) and t<sub>0</sub> (the time-scale over which the changes in the turbulence become significant)</p>
<ol>
<li>The C<sub>N</sub><sup>2</sup> profile</li>
</ol>

<p>These are described in the sub-sections below:</p>
<h3 id="the-full-width-at-half-maximum-fwhm-of-the-seeing-disc">The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the seeing disc</h3>

<p>Without an atmosphere, a small star would have an apparent size, an "<a href="Airy_disk" title="wikilink">Airy disk</a>", in a telescope image determined by <a class="uri" href="diffraction" title="wikilink">diffraction</a> and would be inversely proportional to the diameter of the telescope. However when light enters the <a href="Earth's_atmosphere" title="wikilink">Earth's atmosphere</a>, the different temperature layers and different wind speeds distort the light waves, leading to distortions in the image of a star. The effects of the atmosphere can be modeled as rotating cells of air moving turbulently. At most observatories, the turbulence is only significant on scales larger than r<sub>0</sub> (see below—the seeing parameter r<sub>0</sub> is 10–20 cm at visible wavelengths under the best conditions) and this limits the resolution of telescopes to be about the same as given by a space-based 10–20 cm telescope.</p>

<p>The distortion changes at a high rate, typically more frequently than 100 times a second. In a typical astronomical image of a star with an <a href="exposure_time" title="wikilink">exposure time</a> of seconds or even minutes, the different distortions average out as a filled disc called the point spread function or "seeing disc". The <a class="uri" href="diameter" title="wikilink">diameter</a> of the seeing disk, most often defined as the <a href="full_width_at_half_maximum" title="wikilink">full width at half maximum</a> (FWHM), is a measure of the astronomical seeing conditions.</p>

<p>It follows from this definition that seeing is always a variable quantity, different from place to place, from night to night, and even variable on a scale of minutes. Astronomers often talk about "good" nights with a low average seeing disc diameter, and "bad" nights where the seeing diameter was so high that all observations were worthless.</p>
<div style="float:right">

<p>Image:Eps_aql_movie_not_2000.gif|Slow motion movie of what you see through a telescope when you look at a star at high magnification (negative images). The telescope used had a diameter of about 7r<sub>0</sub> (see definition of r<sub>0</sub> below, and example simulated image through a 7r<sub>0</sub> telescope). Notice how the star breaks up into multiple blobs (speckles) -- entirely an atmospheric effect. Some telescope vibration is also noticeable.</p>
</div>

<p>The FWHM of the seeing disc (or just <em>seeing</em>) is usually measured in <a href="arcsecond" title="wikilink">arcseconds</a>, abbreviated with the symbol (″). A 1.0″ seeing is a good one for average astronomical sites. The seeing of an urban environment is usually much worse. Good seeing nights tend to be clear, cold nights without wind gusts. Warm air rises (<a class="uri" href="convection" title="wikilink">convection</a>), degrading the seeing, as do wind and clouds. At the best high-altitude mountaintop <a href="observatory" title="wikilink">observatories</a>, the wind brings in stable air which has not previously been in contact with the ground, sometimes providing seeing as good as 0.4".</p>
<h3 id="r0-and-t0">r<sub>0</sub> and t<sub>0</sub></h3>

<p>The astronomical seeing conditions at an observatory can be well described by the parameters r<sub>0</sub> and t<sub>0</sub>. For telescopes with diameters smaller than r<sub>0</sub>, the resolution of long-exposure images is determined primarily by diffraction and the size of the Airy pattern and thus is inversely proportional to the telescope diameter. For telescopes with diameters larger than r<sub>0</sub>, the image resolution is determined primarily by the atmosphere and is independent of telescope diameter, remaining constant at the value given by a telescope of diameter equal to r<sub>0</sub>. r<sub>0</sub> also corresponds to the length-scale over which the turbulence becomes significant (10–20 cm at visible wavelengths at good observatories), and t<sub>0</sub> corresponds to the time-scale over which the changes in the turbulence become significant. r<sub>0</sub> determines the spacing of the actuators needed in an <a href="adaptive_optics" title="wikilink">adaptive optics</a> system, and t<sub>0</sub> determines the correction speed required to compensate for the effects of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>r<sub>0</sub> and t<sub>0</sub> vary with the wavelength used for the astronomical imaging, allowing slightly higher resolution imaging at longer wavelengths using large telescopes.</p>

<p>r<sub>0</sub> is often known as the <em><a href="Fried_parameter" title="wikilink">Fried parameter</a></em> (pronounced "freed"), named after <a href="David_L._Fried" title="wikilink">David L. Fried</a>.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Mathematical models can give an accurate model of the effects of astronomical seeing on images taken through ground-based telescopes. Three simulated short-exposure images are shown at the right through three different telescope diameters (as negative images to highlight the fainter features more clearly—a common astronomical convention). The telescope diameters are quoted in terms of the Fried parameter

 varies from 20 cm at the best locations to 5 cm at typical sea-level sites.</p>

<p>In reality, the pattern of blobs (<em>speckles</em>) in the images changes very rapidly, so that long-exposure photographs would just show a single large blurred blob in the centre for each telescope diameter. The diameter (FWHM) of the large blurred blob in long-exposure images is called the seeing disc diameter, and is independent of the telescope diameter used (as long as adaptive optics correction is not applied).</p>

<p>It is first useful to give a brief overview of the basic theory of optical propagation through the atmosphere. In the standard classical theory, light is treated as an oscillation in a field

For all reasonable models of the Earth's atmosphere at optical and infra-red wavelengths the instantaneous imaging performance is dominated by the phase fluctuations

 profiles are generally performed when deciding on the type of adaptive optics system which will be needed at a particular telescope, or in deciding whether or not a particular location would be a good site for setting up a new astronomical observatory. Typically, several methods are used simultaneously for measuring the

 profile and then compared. Some of the most common methods include:</p>

<p>The first answer to this problem was <a href="speckle_imaging" title="wikilink">speckle imaging</a>, which allowed bright objects to be observed with very high resolution. Later came <a class="uri" href="NASA" title="wikilink">NASA</a>'s <a href="Hubble_Space_Telescope" title="wikilink">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, working outside the atmosphere and thus not having any seeing problems and allowing observations of faint targets for the first time (although with poorer resolution than speckle observations of bright sources from ground-based telescopes because of Hubble's smaller telescope diameter). The highest resolution visible and infrared images currently come from imaging optical <a href="astronomical_interferometer" title="wikilink">interferometers</a> such as the <a href="Navy_Prototype_Optical_Interferometer" title="wikilink">Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer</a> or <a href="Cambridge_Optical_Aperture_Synthesis_Telescope" title="wikilink">Cambridge Optical Aperture Synthesis Telescope</a>.</p>

<p>Starting in the 1990s, many telescopes have begun to develop <a href="adaptive_optics" title="wikilink">adaptive optics</a> systems that partially solve the seeing problem, but none of the systems so far built or designed completely removes the atmosphere effect, and observations are usually limited to a small region of the sky surrounding relatively bright stars.  Another cheaper technique, <a href="lucky_imaging" title="wikilink">lucky imaging</a>, has had very good results. This idea dates back to pre-war naked-eye observations of moments of good seeing, which were followed by observations of the planets on cine film after <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. The technique relies on the fact that every so often the effects of the atmosphere will be negligible, and hence by recording large numbers of images in real-time, a 'lucky' excellent image can be picked out. This technique can outperform adaptive optics in many cases and is even accessible to amateurs. It does, however, require very much longer observation times than <a href="adaptive_optics" title="wikilink">adaptive optics</a> for imaging faint targets, and is limited in its maximum resolution.</p>
