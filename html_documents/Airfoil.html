<h1>Airfoil</h1>
<hr/>
<p> An <strong>airfoil</strong> (in <a href="American_and_British_English_spelling_differences" title="wikilink">American English</a>) or <strong>aerofoil</strong> (in <a href="British_English" title="wikilink">British English</a>) is the shape of a <a class="uri" href="wing" title="wikilink">wing</a> or blade (of a <a href="Propeller_(aircraft)" title="wikilink">propeller</a>, <a href="Helicopter_rotor" title="wikilink">rotor</a>, or <a class="uri" href="turbine" title="wikilink">turbine</a>) or <a class="uri" href="sail" title="wikilink">sail</a> as seen in <a href="Multiview_orthographic_projection#Section" title="wikilink">cross-section</a>.</p>
<p>An airfoil-shaped body moved through a <a class="uri" href="fluid" title="wikilink">fluid</a> produces an <a href="aerodynamic_force" title="wikilink">aerodynamic force</a>. The component of this force <a class="uri" href="perpendicular" title="wikilink">perpendicular</a> to the direction of motion is called <a href="lift_(force)" title="wikilink">lift</a>. The component parallel to the direction of motion is called <a href="Drag_(physics)" title="wikilink">drag</a>. <a href="Subsonic_flight" title="wikilink">Subsonic flight</a> airfoils have a characteristic shape with a rounded leading edge, followed by a sharp trailing edge, often with a <a href="Symmetry" title="wikilink">symmetric</a> curvature of upper and lower surfaces. Foils of similar function designed with water as the working fluid are called <a href="hydrofoil" title="wikilink">hydrofoils</a>.</p>
<p>The lift on an airfoil is primarily the result of its angle of attack and shape. When oriented at a suitable angle, the airfoil deflects the oncoming air, resulting in a force on the airfoil in the direction opposite to the deflection. This force is known as <a href="aerodynamic_force" title="wikilink">aerodynamic force</a> and can be resolved into two components: <a href="Lift_(force)" title="wikilink">lift</a> and <a href="Drag_(physics)" title="wikilink">drag</a>. Most foil shapes require a positive angle of attack to generate lift, but <a href="Camber_(aerodynamics)" title="wikilink">cambered</a> airfoils can generate lift at zero angle of attack. This "turning" of the air in the vicinity of the airfoil creates curved <a href="Streamlines,_streaklines,_and_pathlines" title="wikilink">streamlines</a>, resulting in lower pressure on one side and higher pressure on the other. This pressure difference is accompanied by a velocity difference, via <a href="Bernoulli's_principle" title="wikilink">Bernoulli's principle</a>, so the resulting flowfield about the airfoil has a higher average velocity on the upper surface than on the lower surface. The lift force can be related directly to the average top/bottom velocity difference without computing the pressure by using the concept of <a href="circulation_(fluid_dynamics)" title="wikilink">circulation</a> and the <a href="Kutta-Joukowski_theorem" title="wikilink">Kutta-Joukowski theorem</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>A <a href="fixed-wing_aircraft" title="wikilink">fixed-wing aircraft</a>'s wings, <a href="horizontal_stabilizer" title="wikilink">horizontal</a>, and <a href="vertical_stabilizer" title="wikilink">vertical</a> stabilizers are built with airfoil-shaped cross sections, as are <a class="uri" href="helicopter" title="wikilink">helicopter</a> rotor blades. Airfoils are also found in propellers, <a href="Fan_(mechanical)" title="wikilink">fans</a>, <a href="Axial_compressor" title="wikilink">compressors</a> and <a class="uri" href="turbines" title="wikilink">turbines</a>. Sails are also airfoils, and the underwater surfaces of sailboats, such as the <a class="uri" href="centerboard" title="wikilink">centerboard</a> and <a class="uri" href="keel" title="wikilink">keel</a>, are similar in cross-section and operate on the same principles as airfoils. Swimming and flying creatures and even many plants and <a href="Sessility_(zoology)" title="wikilink">sessile</a> organisms employ airfoils/hydrofoils: common examples being bird wings, the bodies of fish, and the shape of <a href="sand_dollar" title="wikilink">sand dollars</a>. An airfoil-shaped wing can create <a class="uri" href="downforce" title="wikilink">downforce</a> on an <a class="uri" href="automobile" title="wikilink">automobile</a> or other motor vehicle, improving <a href="traction_(engineering)" title="wikilink">traction</a>.</p>
<p>Any object with an <a href="angle_of_attack" title="wikilink">angle of attack</a> in a moving fluid, such as a flat plate, a building, or the deck of a bridge, will generate an aerodynamic force (called lift) perpendicular to the flow. Airfoils are more efficient lifting shapes, able to generate more lift (up to a point), and to generate lift with less <a href="drag_(physics)" title="wikilink">drag</a>.</p>
<p>A lift and drag curve obtained in <a href="wind_tunnel" title="wikilink">wind tunnel</a> testing is shown on the right. The curve represents an airfoil with a positive <a href="Camber_(aerodynamics)" title="wikilink">camber</a> so some lift is produced at zero angle of attack. With increased angle of attack, lift increases in a roughly linear relation, called the <em>slope</em> of the lift curve. At about 18 degrees this airfoil stalls, and lift falls off quickly beyond that. The drop in lift can be explained by the action of the upper-surface <a href="boundary_layer" title="wikilink">boundary layer</a>, which separates and greatly thickens over the upper surface at and past the stall angle. The thickened boundary layer's <a href="displacement_thickness" title="wikilink">displacement thickness</a> changes the airfoil's effective shape, in particular it reduces its effective <a href="Camber_(aerodynamics)" title="wikilink">camber</a>, which modifies the overall flow field so as to reduce the <a href="Circulation_(fluid_dynamics)" title="wikilink">circulation</a> and the lift. The thicker boundary layer also causes a large increase in <a href="pressure_drag" title="wikilink">pressure drag</a>, so that the overall drag increases sharply near and past the stall point.</p>
<p>Airfoil design is a major facet of <a class="uri" href="aerodynamics" title="wikilink">aerodynamics</a>. Various airfoils serve different flight regimes. Asymmetric airfoils can generate lift at zero angle of attack, while a symmetric airfoil may better suit frequent inverted flight as in an <a class="uri" href="aerobatic" title="wikilink">aerobatic</a> airplane. In the region of the <a class="uri" href="ailerons" title="wikilink">ailerons</a> and near a <a class="uri" href="wingtip" title="wikilink">wingtip</a> a symmetric airfoil can be used to increase the range of angles of attack to avoid <a href="spin_(flight)" title="wikilink">spin</a>–<a href="stall_(flight)" title="wikilink">stall</a>. Thus a large range of angles can be used without <a href="Boundary_Layer_Separation" title="wikilink">boundary layer separation</a>. Subsonic airfoils have a round leading edge, which is naturally insensitive to the angle of attack. The cross section is not strictly circular, however: the <a href="Radius_of_curvature_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">radius of curvature</a> is increased before the wing achieves maximum thickness to minimize the chance of <a href="flow_separation" title="wikilink">boundary layer separation</a>. This elongates the wing and moves the point of maximum thickness back from the leading edge.</p>
<p><a href="Supersonic_airfoils" title="wikilink">Supersonic airfoils</a> are much more angular in shape and can have a very sharp leading edge, which is very sensitive to angle of attack. A <a href="supercritical_airfoil" title="wikilink">supercritical airfoil</a> has its maximum thickness close to the leading edge to have a lot of length to slowly shock the supersonic flow back to subsonic speeds. Generally such <a class="uri" href="transonic" title="wikilink">transonic</a> airfoils and also the supersonic airfoils have a low camber to reduce <a href="drag_divergence_Mach_number" title="wikilink">drag divergence</a>. Modern aircraft wings may have different airfoil sections along the wing span, each one optimized for the conditions in each section of the wing.</p>
<p>Movable high-lift devices, <a href="flap_(aircraft)" title="wikilink">flaps</a> and sometimes <a href="Leading_edge_slats" title="wikilink">slats</a>, are fitted to airfoils on almost every aircraft. A trailing edge flap acts similarly to an aileron; however, it, as opposed to an aileron, can be retracted partially into the wing if not used.</p>
<p>A <strong>laminar flow wing</strong> has a maximum thickness in the middle camber line. Analyzing the <a href="Navier–Stokes_equations" title="wikilink">Navier–Stokes equations</a> in the linear regime shows that a negative pressure gradient along the flow has the same effect as reducing the speed. So with the maximum camber in the middle, maintaining a laminar flow over a larger percentage of the wing at a higher cruising speed is possible. However, with rain or insects on the wing, or for jetliner speeds, this does not work. Since such a wing stalls more easily, this airfoil is not used on wingtips (spin-stall again).</p>
<p>Schemes have been devised to define airfoils – an example is the <a href="NACA_airfoil" title="wikilink">NACA system</a>. Various airfoil generation systems are also used. An example of a general purpose airfoil that finds wide application, and predates the NACA system, is the <a class="uri" href="Clark-Y" title="wikilink">Clark-Y</a>. Today, airfoils can be designed for specific functions using inverse design programs such as PROFOIL, XFOIL and AeroFoil. XFOIL is an online program created by <a href="Mark_Drela" title="wikilink">Mark Drela</a> that will design and analyze subsonic isolated airfoils.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="airfoil-terminology">Airfoil terminology</h2>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>Airfoil nomenclature</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The various terms related to airfoils are defined below:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>suction surface</em> (a.k.a. upper surface) is generally associated with higher velocity and lower static pressure.</li>
<li>The <em>pressure surface</em> (a.k.a. lower surface) has a comparatively higher static pressure than the suction surface. The pressure gradient between these two surfaces contributes to the lift force generated for a given airfoil.</li>
</ul>
<p>The geometry of the airfoil is described with a variety of terms :</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em><a href="leading_edge" title="wikilink">leading edge</a></em> is the point at the front of the airfoil that has maximum curvature (minimum radius).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></li>
<li>The <em><a href="trailing_edge" title="wikilink">trailing edge</a></em> is defined similarly as the point of maximum curvature at the rear of the airfoil.</li>
<li>The <em><a href="Chord_(aircraft)" title="wikilink">chord line</a></em> is the straight line connecting leading and trailing edges. The <em>chord length</em>, or simply <strong>chord</strong>, <span class="LaTeX">$c$</span>, is the length of the chord line. That is the <strong>reference dimension</strong> of the airfoil section.</li>
</ul>
<p>  The shape of the airfoil is defined using the following geometrical parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>mean camber line</em> or <em>mean line</em> is the locus of points midway between the upper and lower surfaces. Its shape depends on the thickness distribution along the chord;</li>
<li>The <em>thickness</em> of an airfoil varies along the chord. It may be measured in either of two ways:
<ul>
<li>Thickness measured perpendicular to the camber line.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> This is sometimes described as the "American convention";<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></li>
<li>Thickness measured perpendicular to the chord line.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> This is sometimes described as the "British convention".</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Some important parameters to describe an airfoil's shape are its <em><a href="Camber_(aerodynamics)" title="wikilink">camber</a></em> and its <em>thickness</em>. For example, an airfoil of the NACA 4-digit series such as the NACA 2415 (to be read as 2 - 4 - 15) describes an airfoil with a camber of 0.02 chord located at 0.40 chord, with 0.15 chord of maximum thickness.</p>
<p>Finally, important concepts used to describe the airfoil's behavior when moving through a fluid are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em><a href="aerodynamic_center" title="wikilink">aerodynamic center</a></em>, which is the chord-wise length about which the pitching moment is independent of the lift coefficient and the angle of attack.</li>
<li>The <em><a href="center_of_pressure_(fluid_mechanics)" title="wikilink">center of pressure</a></em>, which is the chord-wise location about which the pitching moment is zero.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thin-airfoil-theory">Thin airfoil theory</h2>
<p>  <strong>Thin airfoil theory</strong> is a simple theory of airfoils that relates <a href="angle_of_attack" title="wikilink">angle of attack</a> to lift for incompressible, inviscid flows. It was devised by German-American mathematician <a href="Max_Munk" title="wikilink">Max Munk</a> and further refined by British aerodynamicist <a href="Hermann_Glauert" title="wikilink">Hermann Glauert</a> and others<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> in the 1920s. The theory idealizes the flow around an airfoil as two-dimensional flow around a thin airfoil. It can be imagined as addressing an airfoil of zero thickness and infinite <a class="uri" href="wingspan" title="wikilink">wingspan</a>.</p>
<p>Thin airfoil theory was particularly notable in its day because it provided a sound theoretical basis for the following important properties of airfoils in two-dimensional flow:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><br/>
(1) on a symmetric airfoil, the <a href="center_of_pressure_(fluid_mechanics)" title="wikilink">center of pressure</a> and <a href="aerodynamic_center" title="wikilink">aerodynamic center</a> lies exactly one quarter of the <a href="Chord_(aircraft)" title="wikilink">chord</a> behind the leading edge<br/>
(2) on a <a href="Camber_(aerodynamics)" title="wikilink">cambered</a> airfoil, the <a href="aerodynamic_center" title="wikilink">aerodynamic center</a> lies exactly one quarter of the chord behind the leading edge<br/>
(3) the slope of the <em>lift coefficient versus angle of attack</em> line is <span class="LaTeX">$2 \pi\!$</span> units per radian</p>
<p>As a consequence of (3), the section <a href="lift_coefficient" title="wikilink">lift coefficient</a> of a symmetric airfoil of infinite wingspan is:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\ c_L = 2\pi \alpha$$</span></p>
<dl>
<dd>where <span class="LaTeX">$c_L\!$</span> is the section lift coefficient,
</dd>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$\alpha\!$</span> is the <a href="angle_of_attack" title="wikilink">angle of attack</a> in radians, measured relative to the <a href="Chord_(aircraft)" title="wikilink">chord</a> line.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>(The above expression is also applicable to a cambered airfoil where <span class="LaTeX">$\alpha\!$</span> is the angle of attack measured relative to the <a href="zero-lift_line" title="wikilink">zero-lift line</a> instead of the chord line.)</p>
<p>Also as a consequence of (3), the section lift coefficient of a cambered airfoil of infinite wingspan is:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\ c_L = c_{L_0} + 2\pi\alpha$$</span></p>
<dl>
<dd>where <span class="LaTeX">$\ c_{L_0}$</span> is the section lift coefficient when the angle of attack is zero.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thin airfoil theory does not account for the <a href="Stall_(flight)" title="wikilink">stall</a> of the airfoil, which usually occurs at an angle of attack between 10° and 15° for typical airfoils.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>The airfoil is modeled as a thin lifting mean-line (camber line). The mean-line, y(x), is considered to produce a distribution of <a class="uri" href="vorticity" title="wikilink">vorticity</a> <span class="LaTeX">$\gamma (s)$</span> along the line, s. By the <a href="Kutta_condition" title="wikilink">Kutta condition</a>, the vorticity is zero at the trailing edge. Since the airfoil is thin, x (chord position) can be used instead of s, and all angles can be approximated as small.</p>
<p>From the <a href="Biot–Savart_law" title="wikilink">Biot–Savart law</a>, this vorticity produces a flow field <span class="LaTeX">$w(x)$</span> where</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$w(x) = \frac{1} {(2 \pi)} \int_{0}^{c} \frac {\gamma (x')}{(x-x')} dx'$$</span></p>
<p>where <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> is the location where induced velocity is produced, <span class="LaTeX">$x'$</span> is the location of the vortex element producing the velocity and <span class="LaTeX">$c$</span> is the chord length of the airfoil.</p>
<p>Since there is no flow normal to the curved surface of the airfoil, <span class="LaTeX">$w(x)$</span> balances that from the component of main flow <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span>, which is locally normal to the plate – the main flow is locally inclined to the plate by an angle <span class="LaTeX">$\alpha - dy/dx$</span>. That is:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$V \; (\alpha - dy/dx) = w(x) = \frac{1} {(2 \pi)} \int_{0}^{c} \frac {\gamma (x')}{(x-x')} dx'$$</span></p>
<p>This integral equation can by solved for <span class="LaTeX">$\gamma(x)$</span>, after replacing x by</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\ x = c(1 - \cos (\theta ))/2$$</span> ,</p>
<p>as a Fourier series in <span class="LaTeX">$A_n \sin(n \theta)$</span> with a modified lead term <span class="LaTeX">$A_0 (1 + \cos (\theta)) / \sin(\theta)$</span></p>
<p>That is</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\frac{\gamma(\theta)} {(2V)} = A_0 \frac {(1 + \cos(\theta))} {\sin(\theta)} + \sum  A_n \; \sin (n \theta))$$</span></p>
<p>(These terms are known as the <a href="Hermann_Glauert" title="wikilink">Glauert</a> integral).</p>
<p>The coefficients are given by</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$A_0 = \alpha - \frac {1}{\pi} \int_{0}^{\pi} (dy/dx) \; d\theta$$</span></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$A_n = \frac {2}{\pi} \int_{0}^{\pi} \cos (n \theta) (dy/dx) \; d\theta$$</span></p>
<p>By the <a href="Kutta–Joukowski_theorem" title="wikilink">Kutta–Joukowski theorem</a>, the total lift force F is proportional to</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\rho V \int_{0}^{c} \gamma (x) \; dx$$</span></p>
<p>and its moment M about the leading edge to</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\rho V \int_{0}^{c} x \; \gamma (x) \; dx$$</span></p>
<p>The calculated Lift coefficient depends only on the first two terms of the Fourier series, as</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\ C_L = 2 \pi (A_0 + A_1/2)$$</span></p>
<p>The moment M about the leading edge depends only on <span class="LaTeX">$A_0,  A_1$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$A_2$</span> , as</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\ C_M = - 0.5 \pi (A_0+A_1-A_2/2)$$</span></p>
<p>The moment about the 1/4 chord point will thus be,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\ C_M(1/4c) = - \pi /4 (A_1 - A_2)$$</span>.</p>
<p>From this it follows that the <a href="center_of_pressure_(fluid_mechanics)" title="wikilink">center of pressure</a> is aft of the 'quarter-chord' point 0.25 c, by</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\ \Delta x /c = \pi /4 ((A_1-A_2)/C_L)$$</span></p>
<p>The <a href="aerodynamic_center" title="wikilink">aerodynamic center</a>, AC, is at the quarter-chord point. The AC is where the pitching moment M' does not <em>vary</em> with angle of attack, i.e.,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\frac { \partial (C_{M'}) }{ \partial (C_L)} = 0$$</span></p>
