<p>In <a href="graph_theory" title="wikilink">graph theory</a>, an <strong>adjacent vertex</strong> of a <a href="vertex_(graph_theory)" title="wikilink">vertex</a> <em>v</em> in a <a href="Graph_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">graph</a> is a vertex that is connected to <em>v</em> by an <a href="edge_(graph_theory)" title="wikilink">edge</a>. The <strong>neighbourhood</strong> of a vertex <em>v</em> in a graph <em>G</em> is the <a href="induced_subgraph#Subgraphs" title="wikilink">induced subgraph</a> of <em>G</em> consisting of all vertices adjacent to <em>v</em>. For example, the image shows a graph of 6 vertices and 7 edges. Vertex 5 is adjacent to vertices 1, 2, and 4 but it is not adjacent to 3 and 6. The neighbourhood of vertex 5 is the graph with three vertices, 1, 2, and 4, and one edge connecting vertices 1 and 2.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood is often denoted <em>N</em><sub><em>G</em></sub>(<em>v</em>) or (when the graph is unambiguous) <em>N</em>(<em>v</em>). The same neighbourhood notation may also be used to refer to sets of adjacent vertices rather than the corresponding induced subgraphs. The neighbourhood described above does not include <em>v</em> itself, and is more specifically the <strong>open neighbourhood</strong> of <em>v</em>; it is also possible to define a neighbourhood in which <em>v</em> itself is included, called the <strong>closed neighbourhood</strong> and denoted by <em>N</em><sub><em>G</em></sub>[<em>v</em>]. When stated without any qualification, a neighbourhood is assumed to be open.</p>

<p>Neighbourhoods may be used to represent graphs in computer algorithms, via the <a href="adjacency_list" title="wikilink">adjacency list</a> and <a href="adjacency_matrix" title="wikilink">adjacency matrix</a> representations. Neighbourhoods are also used in the <a href="clustering_coefficient" title="wikilink">clustering coefficient</a> of a graph, which is a measure of the average <a href="Dense_graph" title="wikilink">density</a> of its neighbourhoods. In addition, many important classes of graphs may be defined by properties of their neighbourhoods, or by symmetries that relate neighbourhoods to each other.</p>

<p>An <a href="isolated_vertex" title="wikilink">isolated vertex</a> has no adjacent vertices. The <a href="degree_(graph_theory)" title="wikilink">degree</a> of a vertex is equal to the number of adjacent vertices. A special case is a <a href="loop_(graph_theory)" title="wikilink">loop</a> that connects a vertex to itself; if such an edge exists, the vertex belongs to its own neighbourhood.</p>
<h2 id="local-properties-in-graphs">Local properties in graphs</h2>

<p> If all vertices in <em>G</em> have neighbourhoods that are <a href="Graph_isomorphism" title="wikilink">isomorphic</a> to the same graph <em>H</em>, <em>G</em> is said to be <em>locally H</em>, and if all vertices in <em>G</em> have neighbourhoods that belong to some graph family <em>F</em>, <em>G</em> is said to be <em>locally F</em> (, ). For instance, in the <a href="Octahedron" title="wikilink">octahedron graph</a> shown in the figure, each vertex has a neighbourhood isomorphic to a <a href="Cycle_graph" title="wikilink">cycle</a> of four vertices, so the octahedron is locally <em>C</em><sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any <a href="complete_graph" title="wikilink">complete graph</a> <em>K</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> is locally <em>K</em><sub><em>n-1</em></sub>. The only graphs that are locally complete are disjoint unions of complete graphs.</li>
<li>A <a href="Turán_graph" title="wikilink">Turán graph</a> <em>T</em>(<em>rs</em>,<em>r</em>) is locally <em>T</em>((<em>r</em>-1)<em>s</em>,<em>r</em>-1). More generally any Turán graph is locally Turán.</li>
<li>Every <a href="planar_graph" title="wikilink">planar graph</a> is locally <a href="Outerplanar_graph" title="wikilink">outerplanar</a>. However, not every locally outerplanar graph is planar.</li>
<li>A graph is <a href="triangle-free_graph" title="wikilink">triangle-free</a> if and only if it is locally <a href="Independent_set_(graph_theory)" title="wikilink">independent</a>.</li>
<li>Every <em>k</em>-<a href="Chromatic_number" title="wikilink">chromatic</a> graph is locally (<em>k</em>-1)-chromatic. Every locally <em>k</em>-chromatic graph has chromatic number

<li>If a graph family <em>F</em> is closed under the operation of taking induced subgraphs, then every graph in <em>F</em> is also locally <em>F</em>. For instance, every <a href="chordal_graph" title="wikilink">chordal graph</a> is locally chordal; every <a href="perfect_graph" title="wikilink">perfect graph</a> is locally perfect; every <a href="comparability_graph" title="wikilink">comparability graph</a> is locally comparable.</li>
<li>A graph is locally cyclic if every neighbourhood is a <a href="Cycle_graph" title="wikilink">cycle</a>. For instance, the <a class="uri" href="octahedron" title="wikilink">octahedron</a> is the unique locally <em>C</em><sub>4</sub> graph, the <a class="uri" href="icosahedron" title="wikilink">icosahedron</a> is the unique locally <em>C</em><sub>5</sub> graph, and the <a href="Paley_graph" title="wikilink">Paley graph</a> of order 13 is locally <em>C</em><sub>6</sub>. Locally cyclic graphs other than <em>K</em><sub>4</sub> are exactly the underlying graphs of <a href="Triangulation_(topology)" title="wikilink">Whitney triangulations</a>, embeddings of graphs on surfaces in such a way that the faces of the embedding are the cliques of the graph (; ; ). Locally cyclic graphs can have as many as

<li><a href="Claw-free_graph" title="wikilink">Claw-free graphs</a> are the graphs that are locally co-<a href="triangle-free_graph" title="wikilink">triangle-free</a>; that is, for all vertices, the <a href="complement_graph" title="wikilink">complement graph</a> of the neighborhood of the vertex does not contain a triangle. A graph that is locally <em>H</em> is claw-free if and only if the <a href="independence_number" title="wikilink">independence number</a> of <em>H</em> is at most two; for instance, the graph of the regular icosahedron is claw-free because it is locally <em>C</em><sub>5</sub> and <em>C</em><sub>5</sub> has independence number two.</li>

<h2 id="neighbourhood-of-a-set">Neighbourhood of a Set</h2>

<p>For a set <em>A</em> of vertices, the neighbourhood of <em>A</em> is the union of the neighbourhoods of the vertices, and so it is the set of all vertices adjacent to at least one member of <em>A</em>.</p>

<p>A set <em>A</em> of vertices in a graph is said to be a module if every vertex in <em>A</em> has the same set of neighbours outside of <em>A</em>. Any graph has a uniquely recursive decomposition into modules, its <a href="modular_decomposition" title="wikilink">modular decomposition</a>, which can be constructed from the graph in <a href="linear_time" title="wikilink">linear time</a>; modular decomposition algorithms have applications in other graph algorithms including the recognition of <a href="comparability_graph" title="wikilink">comparability graphs</a>.</p>
