<h1>Observable universe</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>observable universe</strong> consists of the galaxies and other matter that can, in principle, be observed from <a class="uri" href="Earth" title="wikilink">Earth</a> at the present time because light and other signals from these objects has had time to reach the Earth since the beginning of the <a href="Metric_expansion_of_space" title="wikilink">cosmological expansion</a>. Assuming <a href="cosmological_principle" title="wikilink">the universe is isotropic</a>, the distance to the edge of the observable universe is roughly the same in every direction. That is, the observable universe is a spherical volume (a <a href="ball_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">ball</a>) centered on the observer. Every location in the <a class="uri" href="Universe" title="wikilink">Universe</a> has its own observable universe, which may or may not overlap with the one centered on Earth.</p>

<p>The word <em>observable</em> used in this sense does not depend on whether modern technology actually permits detection of <a class="uri" href="radiation" title="wikilink">radiation</a> from an object in this region (or indeed on whether there is any radiation to detect). It simply indicates that it is possible <em>in principle</em> for light or other signals from the object to reach an observer on Earth. In practice, we can see light only from as far back as the time of photon decoupling in the <a href="Recombination_(cosmology)" title="wikilink">recombination</a> <a href="Epoch_(cosmology)" title="wikilink">epoch</a>. That is when particles were first able to emit <a href="photon" title="wikilink">photons</a> that were not quickly re-absorbed by other particles. Before then, the Universe was filled with a <a href="Quark–gluon_plasma" title="wikilink">plasma</a> that was opaque to photons.</p>

<p>The <a href="Last_scattering_surface" title="wikilink">surface of last scattering</a> is the collection of points in space at the exact distance that photons from the time of photon decoupling just reach us today. These are the photons we detect today as <a href="cosmic_microwave_background_radiation" title="wikilink">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> (CMBR). However, with future technology, it may be possible to observe the still older <a href="Cosmic_neutrino_background" title="wikilink">relic neutrino background</a>, or even more distant events via <a href="gravitational_wave" title="wikilink">gravitational waves</a> (which also should move at the speed of light). Sometimes astrophysicists distinguish between the <em>visible</em> universe, which includes only signals emitted since recombination—and the <em>observable</em> universe, which includes signals since the beginning of the cosmological expansion (the Big Bang in traditional cosmology, the end of the <a href="inflationary_epoch" title="wikilink">inflationary epoch</a> in modern cosmology). According to calculations, the <em><a href="comoving_distance" title="wikilink">comoving distance</a></em> (current proper distance) to particles from the CMBR, which represent the radius of the visible universe, is about 14.0 billion <a href="parsec" title="wikilink">parsecs</a> (about 45.7 billion light years), while the comoving distance to the edge of the observable universe is about 14.3 billion parsecs (about 46.6 billion light years),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> about 2% larger.</p>

<p>The best estimate of the <a href="age_of_the_universe" title="wikilink">age of the universe</a>  is  years<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> but due to the <a href="Metric_expansion_of_space" title="wikilink">expansion of space</a> humans are observing objects that were originally much closer but are now considerably farther away (as defined in terms of cosmological <a href="Comoving_distance#Uses_of_the_proper_distance" title="wikilink">proper distance</a>, which is equal to the <a href="comoving_distance" title="wikilink">comoving distance</a> at the present time) than a static 13.8 billion <a href="light-year" title="wikilink">light-years</a> distance.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> It is estimated that the <a class="uri" href="diameter" title="wikilink">diameter</a> of the observable universe is about 28 gigaparsecs (93 billion <a href="light-year" title="wikilink">light-years</a>, ),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> putting the edge of the observable universe at about 46–47 billion light-years away.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-universe-versus-the-observable-universe">The Universe versus the observable universe</h2>

<p>Some parts of the Universe are too far away for the light emitted since the Big Bang to have had enough time to reach Earth, so these portions of the Universe lie outside the observable universe. In the future, light from distant galaxies will have had more time to travel, so additional regions will become observable. However, due to <a href="Hubble's_law" title="wikilink">Hubble's law</a> regions sufficiently distant from us are expanding away from us faster than the speed of light (<a href="special_relativity" title="wikilink">special relativity</a> prevents nearby objects in the same local region from moving faster than the speed of light with respect to each other, but there is no such constraint for distant objects when the space between them is expanding; see <a href="Comoving_distance#Uses_of_the_proper_distance" title="wikilink">uses of the proper distance</a> for a discussion) and furthermore the <a href="Accelerating_universe" title="wikilink">expansion rate appears to be accelerating</a> due to <a href="dark_energy" title="wikilink">dark energy</a>. Assuming dark energy remains constant (an unchanging <a href="cosmological_constant" title="wikilink">cosmological constant</a>), so that the expansion rate of the Universe continues to accelerate, there is a "future visibility limit" beyond which objects will <em>never</em> enter our observable universe at any time in the infinite future, because light emitted by objects outside that limit would never reach us. (A subtlety is that, because the <a href="Hubble's_law#Interpretation" title="wikilink">Hubble parameter</a> is decreasing with time, there can be cases where a galaxy that is receding from us just a bit faster than light does emit a signal that reaches us eventually<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>). This future visibility limit is calculated at a <a href="comoving_distance" title="wikilink">comoving distance</a> of 19 billion parsecs (62 billion light years) assuming the Universe will keep expanding forever, which implies the number of galaxies that we can ever theoretically observe in the infinite future (leaving aside the issue that some may be impossible to observe in practice due to redshift, as discussed in the following paragraph) is only larger than the number currently observable by a factor of 2.36.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>  Though in principle more galaxies will become observable in the future, in practice an increasing number of galaxies will become extremely <a href="redshift" title="wikilink">redshifted</a> due to ongoing expansion, so much so that they will seem to disappear from view and become invisible.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> An additional subtlety is that a galaxy at a given comoving distance is defined to lie within the "observable universe" if we can receive signals emitted by the galaxy at any age in its past history (say, a signal sent from the galaxy only 500 million years after the Big Bang), but because of the Universe's expansion, there may be some later age at which a signal sent from the same galaxy can <em>never</em> reach us at any point in the infinite future (so for example we might never see what the galaxy looked like 10 billion years after the Big Bang),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> even though it remains at the same comoving distance (comoving distance is defined to be constant with time—unlike proper distance, which is used to define recession velocity due to the expansion of space), which is less than the comoving radius of the observable universe. This fact can be used to define a type of cosmic <a href="event_horizon" title="wikilink">event horizon</a> whose distance from us changes over time. For example, the current distance to this horizon is about 16 billion light years, meaning that a signal from an event happening <em>at present</em> can eventually reach us in the future if the event is less than 16 billion light years away, but the signal will never reach us if the event is more than 16 billion light years away.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>Both popular and professional research articles in cosmology often use the term "universe" to mean "observable universe". This can be justified on the grounds that we can never know anything by direct experimentation about any part of the Universe that is <a href="Causality_(physics)" title="wikilink">causally disconnected</a> from us, although many credible theories require a total universe much larger than the observable universe. No evidence exists to suggest that the boundary of the observable universe constitutes a boundary on the Universe as a whole, nor do any of the mainstream cosmological models propose that the Universe has any physical boundary in the first place, though some models propose it could be finite but unbounded, like a higher-dimensional analogue of the 2D surface of a sphere that is finite in area but has no edge. It is plausible that the <a class="uri" href="galaxies" title="wikilink">galaxies</a> within our observable universe represent only a minuscule fraction of the galaxies in the Universe. According to the theory of <a href="cosmic_inflation" title="wikilink">cosmic inflation</a> and its founder, <a href="Alan_Guth" title="wikilink">Alan Guth</a>, if it is assumed that inflation began about 10<sup>−37</sup> seconds after the Big Bang, then with the plausible assumption that the size of the Universe at this time was approximately equal to the speed of light times its age, that would suggest that at present the entire universe's size is at least 3x10<sup>23</sup> times larger than the size of the observable universe.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> There are also lower estimates claiming that the entire universe is in excess of 250 times larger than the observable universe.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>If the Universe is finite but unbounded, it is also possible that the Universe is <em>smaller</em> than the observable universe. In this case, what we take to be very distant galaxies may actually be duplicate images of nearby galaxies, formed by light that has circumnavigated the Universe. It is difficult to test this hypothesis experimentally because different images of a galaxy would show different eras in its history, and consequently might appear quite different. Bielewicz et al.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> claims to establish a lower bound of 27.9 gigaparsecs (91 billion light-years) on the diameter of the last scattering surface (since this is only a lower bound, the paper leaves open the possibility that the whole universe is much larger, even infinite). This value is based on matching-circle analysis of the <a class="uri" href="WMAP" title="wikilink">WMAP</a> 7 year data. This approach has been disputed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="size">Size</h2>

<p> The <a href="comoving_distance" title="wikilink">comoving distance</a> from Earth to the edge of the observable universe is about 14 <a href="parsec" title="wikilink">gigaparsecs</a> (46 <a href="1000000000_(number)" title="wikilink">billion</a> <a href="light_year" title="wikilink">light years</a> or ) in any direction. The observable universe is thus a sphere with a <a class="uri" href="diameter" title="wikilink">diameter</a> of about 29 gigaparsecs<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> ().<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Assuming that space is roughly <a href="Euclidean_space" title="wikilink">flat</a>, this size corresponds to a comoving volume of about <mtpl></mtpl> (<mtpl></mtpl> or ).</p>

<p>The figures quoted above are distances <em>now</em> (in <a href="cosmological_time" title="wikilink">cosmological time</a>), not distances <em>at the time the light was emitted</em>. For example, the cosmic microwave background radiation that we see right now was emitted at the <a href="Recombination_(cosmology)" title="wikilink">time of photon decoupling</a>, estimated to have occurred about  years after the Big Bang,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> which occurred around 13.8 billion years ago. This radiation was emitted by matter that has, in the intervening time, mostly condensed into galaxies, and those galaxies are now calculated to be about 46 billion light-years from us.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> To estimate the distance to that matter at the time the light was emitted, we may first note that according to the <a href="Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker_metric" title="wikilink">Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric</a>, which is used to model the expanding universe, if at the present time we receive light with a <a class="uri" href="redshift" title="wikilink">redshift</a> of <em>z</em>, then the <a href="Scale_factor_(cosmology)" title="wikilink">scale factor</a> at the time the light was originally emitted is given by<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a>

<dd>The <a href="age_of_the_universe" title="wikilink">age of the universe</a> is estimated to be 13.8 billion years. While it is commonly understood that nothing can accelerate to velocities equal to or greater than that of light, it is a common misconception that the radius of the observable universe must therefore amount to only 13.8 billion light-years. This reasoning would only make sense if the flat, static <a href="Minkowski_space" title="wikilink">Minkowski spacetime</a> conception under special relativity were correct. In the real universe, <a class="uri" href="spacetime" title="wikilink">spacetime</a> is curved in a way that corresponds to the <a href="Metric_expansion_of_space" title="wikilink">expansion of space</a>, as evidenced by <a href="Hubble's_law" title="wikilink">Hubble's law</a>.

<dd>In 2003, Cornish et al.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> found this lower bound for the diameter of the <em>whole</em> universe (not just the observable part), if we postulate that the universe is finite in size due to its having a nontrivial <a class="uri" href="topology" title="wikilink">topology</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> with this lower bound based on the estimated current distance between points that we can see on opposite sides of the <a href="cosmic_microwave_background_radiation" title="wikilink">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> (CMBR). If the whole universe is smaller than this sphere, then light has had time to circumnavigate it since the big bang, producing multiple images of distant points in the CMBR, which would show up as patterns of repeating circles.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Cornish et al. looked for such an effect at scales of up to 24 gigaparsecs () and failed to find it, and suggested that if they could extend their search to all possible orientations, they would then "be able to exclude the possibility that we live in a universe smaller than 24 Gpc in diameter". The authors also estimated that with "lower noise and higher resolution CMB maps (from <a href="Wilkinson_Microwave_Anisotropy_Probe" title="wikilink">WMAP</a>'s extended mission and from <a href="Planck_satellite" title="wikilink">Planck</a>), we will be able to search for smaller circles and extend the limit to ~28 Gpc."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> This estimate of the maximum lower bound that can be established by future observations corresponds to a radius of 14 gigaparsecs, or around 46 billion light years, about the same as the figure for the radius of the visible universe (whose radius is defined by the CMBR sphere) given in the opening section. A 2012 preprint by most of the same authors as the Cornish et al. paper has extended the current lower bound to a diameter of 98.5% the diameter of the CMBR sphere, or about 26 Gpc.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a>

<p>The organization of structure arguably begins at the stellar level, though most cosmologists rarely address <a class="uri" href="astrophysics" title="wikilink">astrophysics</a> on that scale. <a href="Star" title="wikilink">Stars</a> are organized into <a href="Galaxy" title="wikilink">galaxies</a>, which in turn form <a href="galaxy_group" title="wikilink">galaxy groups</a>, <a href="galaxy_cluster" title="wikilink">galaxy clusters</a>, <a href="supercluster" title="wikilink">superclusters</a>, sheets, <a href="Galaxy_filament" title="wikilink">walls and filaments</a>, which are separated by immense <a href="void_(astronomy)" title="wikilink">voids</a>, creating a vast foam-like structure sometimes called the "cosmic web". Prior to 1989, it was commonly assumed that <a href="virial_theorem" title="wikilink">virialized</a> galaxy clusters were the largest structures in existence, and that they were distributed more or less uniformly throughout the Universe in every direction. However, since the early 1980s, more and more structures have been discovered. In 1983, Adrian Webster identified the <a href="Webster_LQG" title="wikilink">Webster LQG</a>, a <a href="large_quasar_group" title="wikilink">large quasar group</a> consisting of 5 quasars. The discovery was the first identification of a large-scale structure, and has expanded the information about the known grouping of matter in the Universe. In 1987, Robert Brent Tully identified the <a href="Pisces–Cetus_Supercluster_Complex" title="wikilink">Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex</a>, the galaxy filament in which the Milky Way resides. It is about 1 billion light years across. That same year, an unusually large region with no galaxies has been discovered, the <a href="Giant_Void" title="wikilink">Giant Void</a>, which measures 1.3 billion light years across. Based on <a href="redshift_survey" title="wikilink">redshift survey</a> data, in 1989 <a href="Margaret_Geller" title="wikilink">Margaret Geller</a> and <a href="John_Huchra" title="wikilink">John Huchra</a> discovered the "<a href="CfA2_Great_Wall" title="wikilink">Great Wall</a>",<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> a sheet of galaxies more than 500 million <a href="light-year" title="wikilink">light-years</a> long and 200 million wide, but only 15 million light-years thick. The existence of this structure escaped notice for so long because it requires locating the position of galaxies in three dimensions, which involves combining location information about the galaxies with distance information from <a href="redshift" title="wikilink">redshifts</a>. Two years later, astronomers Roger G. Clowes and Luis E. Campusano discovered the <a href="Clowes–Campusano_LQG" title="wikilink">Clowes–Campusano LQG</a>, a <a href="large_quasar_group" title="wikilink">large quasar group</a> measuring two billion light years at its widest point, and was the largest known structure in the Universe at the time of its announcement. In April 2003, another large-scale structure was discovered, the <a href="Sloan_Great_Wall" title="wikilink">Sloan Great Wall</a>. In August 2007, a possible supervoid was detected in the constellation <a href="Eridanus_(constellation)" title="wikilink">Eridanus</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> It coincides with the '<a href="CMB_cold_spot" title="wikilink">CMB cold spot</a>', a cold region in the microwave sky that is highly improbable under the currently favored cosmological model. This supervoid could cause the cold spot, but to do so it would have to be improbably big, possibly a billion light-years across, almost as big as the Giant Void mentioned above.  Another large-scale structure is the <a href="Himiko_(Lyman-alpha_blob)" title="wikilink">Newfound Blob</a>, a collection of galaxies and enormous gas bubbles that measures about 200 million light years across.</p>

<p>Another indicator of large-scale structure is the '<a href="Lyman-alpha_forest" title="wikilink">Lyman-alpha forest</a>'. This is a collection of <a href="absorption_line" title="wikilink">absorption lines</a> that appear in the spectra of light from <a href="quasar" title="wikilink">quasars</a>, which are interpreted as indicating the existence of huge thin sheets of intergalactic (mostly <a class="uri" href="hydrogen" title="wikilink">hydrogen</a>) gas. These sheets appear to be associated with the formation of new galaxies.</p>

<p>Caution is required in describing structures on a cosmic scale because things are often different from how they appear. <a href="Gravitational_lens" title="wikilink">Gravitational lensing</a> (bending of light by gravitation) can make an image appear to originate in a different direction from its real source. This is caused when foreground objects (such as galaxies) curve surrounding spacetime (as predicted by <a href="general_relativity" title="wikilink">general relativity</a>), and deflect passing light rays. Rather usefully, strong gravitational lensing can sometimes magnify distant galaxies, making them easier to detect. <a href="Weak_Gravitational_Lensing" title="wikilink">Weak lensing</a> (gravitational shear) by the intervening universe in general also subtly changes the observed large-scale structure. As of 2004, measurements of this subtle shear showed considerable promise as a test of cosmological models.</p>

<p>The large-scale structure of the Universe also looks different if one only uses <a class="uri" href="redshift" title="wikilink">redshift</a> to measure distances to galaxies. For example, galaxies behind a galaxy cluster are attracted to it, and so fall towards it, and so are slightly blueshifted (compared to how they would be if there were no cluster) On the near side, things are slightly redshifted. Thus, the environment of the cluster looks a bit squashed if using redshifts to measure distance. An opposite effect works on the galaxies already within a cluster: the galaxies have some random motion around the cluster center, and when these random motions are converted to redshifts, the cluster appears elongated. This creates a "<em><a href="Fingers_of_God" title="wikilink">finger of God</a></em>"—the illusion of a long chain of galaxies pointed at the Earth.</p>

These galaxies are all <a href="redshift" title="wikilink">redshifted</a>, in accordance with <a href="Hubble's_law" title="wikilink">Hubble's law</a>. This indicates that they are receding from us and from each other, but the variations in their redshift are sufficient to reveal the existence of a concentration of mass equivalent to tens of thousands of galaxies.</p>

<p>The Great Attractor, discovered in 1986, lies at a distance of between 150 million and 250 million light-years (250 million is the most recent estimate), in the direction of the <a href="Hydra_(constellation)" title="wikilink">Hydra</a> and <a class="uri" href="Centaurus" title="wikilink">Centaurus</a> <a href="constellation" title="wikilink">constellations</a>.

<p>There is no way to know exactly the number of stars, but from current literature, the range of 10<sup>22</sup> to 10<sup>24</sup> is normally quoted.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> One way to substantiate this range is to estimate the number of galaxies and multiply by the number of stars in an average galaxy. The 2004 <a href="Hubble_Ultra-Deep_Field" title="wikilink">Hubble Ultra-Deep Field</a> image contains an estimated  galaxies.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> The patch of sky in this area, is 3.4 arc minutes on each side. For a relative comparison, it would require over 50 of these images to cover the full moon. If this area is typical for the entire sky, there are over 100 billion galaxies in the Universe.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> More recently, in 2012, Hubble scientists produced the <a href="Hubble_Extreme_Deep_Field" title="wikilink">Hubble Extreme Deep Field</a> image which showed slightly more galaxies for a comparable area.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> However, in order to compute the number of stars based on these images, we would need additional assumptions: the percent of both large and dwarf galaxies; and, their average number of stars. Thus, a reasonable option is to assume 100 billion average galaxies and 100 billion stars per average galaxy. This results in 10<sup>22</sup> stars. Next, we need average star mass which can be calculated from the distribution of stars in the Milky Way. Within the Milky Way, if a large number of stars are counted by spectral class, 73% are class M stars which contain only 30% of the Sun's mass. Considering mass and number of stars in each spectral class, the average star is 51.5% of the Sun's mass.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The Sun's mass is . so a reasonable number for the mass of an average star in the Universe is 10<sup>30</sup> kg. Thus, the mass of all stars equals the number of stars (10<sup>22</sup>) times an average mass of star (10<sup>30</sup> kg) or 10<sup>52</sup> kg. The next calculation adjusts for Interstellar Medium (ISM) and Intergalactic Medium (IGM). ISM is material between stars: gas (mostly hydrogen) and dust. IGM is material between galaxies, mostly hydrogen. Ordinary matter (protons, neutrons and electrons) exists in ISM and IGM as well as in stars. In the reference, "The Cosmic Energy Inventory“, the percentage of each part is defined: stars = 5.9%, Interstellar Medium (ISM) = 1.7%, and Intergalactic Medium (IGM) = 92.4%.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Thus, to extrapolate the mass of the Universe from the star mass, divide the 10<sup>52</sup> kg mass calculated for stars by 5.9%.

<p>This calculation yields approximately ; however, this represents <strong>all</strong> energy/matter and is based on the <a href="Hubble_volume" title="wikilink">Hubble volume</a> (the volume of a sphere with radius equal to the <a href="Hubble_length" title="wikilink">Hubble length</a> of about 13.8 billion light years). The critical density calculation above was based on the <a href="comoving_distance" title="wikilink">comoving distance</a> radius of 46.6 billion light years. Thus, the Hoyle equation mass/energy result must be adjusted for increased volume. The comoving distance radius gives a volume about 39 times greater (46.7 cubed divided by 13.8 cubed). However, as volume increases, ordinary matter and dark matter would not increase; only dark energy increases with volume. Thus, assuming ordinary matter, neutrinos, and dark matter are 31.7% of the total mass/energy, and dark energy is 68.3%, the amount of total mass/energy for the steady-state calculation would be: mass of ordinary matter and dark matter (31.7% times ) plus the mass of dark energy ((68.3% times ) times increased volume (39)). This equals: . As noted above for the Critical Density method, ordinary matter is 4.8% of all energy/matter. If the Hoyle result is multiplied by this percent, the result for ordinary matter is .</p>

In 2009, a <a href="gamma_ray_burst" title="wikilink">gamma ray burst</a>, <a href="GRB_090423" title="wikilink">GRB 090423</a>, was found to have a <a class="uri" href="redshift" title="wikilink">redshift</a> of 8.2, which indicates that the collapsing star that caused it exploded when the Universe was only 630 million years old.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn79" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> The burst happened approximately 13 billion years ago,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn80" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> so a distance of about 13 billion light years was widely quoted in the media (or sometimes a more precise figure of 13.035 billion light years),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn81" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> though this would be the "light travel distance" (<em>see</em> <a href="Distance_measures_(cosmology)" title="wikilink">Distance measures (cosmology)</a>) rather than the "<a href="Comoving_distance#Uses_of_the_proper_distance" title="wikilink">proper distance</a>" used in both <a href="Hubble's_law" title="wikilink">Hubble's law</a> and in defining the size of the observable universe (cosmologist <a href="Edward_L._Wright" title="wikilink">Ned Wright</a> argues against the common use of light travel distance in astronomical press releases on <a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/Dltt_is_Dumb.html">this page</a>, and at the bottom of the page offers online calculators that can be used to calculate the current proper distance to a distant object in a flat universe based on either the redshift <em>z</em> or the light travel time). The proper distance for a redshift of 8.2 would be about 9.2 <a href="Megaparsecs" title="wikilink">Gpc</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn82" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> or about 30 billion light years. Another record-holder for most distant object is a galaxy observed through and located beyond <a href="Abell_2218" title="wikilink">Abell 2218</a>, also with a light travel distance of approximately 13 billion light years from Earth, with observations from the <a href="Hubble_telescope" title="wikilink">Hubble telescope</a> indicating a redshift between 6.6 and 7.1, and observations from <a href="W._M._Keck_Observatory" title="wikilink">Keck</a> telescopes indicating a redshift towards the upper end of this range, around 7.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn83" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> The galaxy's light now observable on Earth would have begun to emanate from its source about 750 million years after the <a href="Big_Bang" title="wikilink">Big Bang</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn84" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="horizons">Horizons</h2>

<p>The limit of observability in our universe is set by a set of cosmological horizons which limit, based on various physical constraints, the extent to which we can obtain information about various events in the Universe. The most famous horizon is the <a href="particle_horizon" title="wikilink">particle horizon</a> which sets a limit on the precise distance that can be seen due to the finite <a href="age_of_the_Universe" title="wikilink">age of the Universe</a>. Additional horizons are associated with the possible future extent of observations (larger than the particle horizon owing to the <a href="expansion_of_space" title="wikilink">expansion of space</a>), an "optical horizon" at the <a href="surface_of_last_scattering" title="wikilink">surface of last scattering</a>, and associated horizons with the surface of last scattering for <a href="cosmic_neutrino_background" title="wikilink">neutrinos</a> and <a href="gravitational_wave_background" title="wikilink">gravitational waves</a>.</p>
