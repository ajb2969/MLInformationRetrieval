<h1>Connected space</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="topology" title="wikilink">topology</a> and related branches of <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, a <strong>connected space</strong> is a <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topological space</a> that cannot be represented as the <a href="union_(set_theory)" title="wikilink">union</a> of two or more <a href="disjoint_set" title="wikilink">disjoint</a> nonempty <a href="open_(topology)" title="wikilink">open</a> subsets. Connectedness is one of the principal <a href="topological_properties" title="wikilink">topological properties</a> that is used to distinguish topological spaces. A stronger notion is that of a <strong>path-connected space</strong>, which is a space where any two points can be joined by a <a href="path_(topology)" title="wikilink">path</a>.</p>

<p>A subset of a topological space <em>X</em> is a <strong>connected set</strong> if it is a connected space when viewed as a <a href="Subspace_topology" title="wikilink">subspace</a> of <em>X</em>.</p>

<p>An example of a space that is not connected is a plane with an infinite line deleted from it. Other examples of disconnected spaces (that is, spaces which are not connected) include the plane with an <a href="Annulus_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">annulus</a> removed, as well as the union of two disjoint closed <a href="Disk_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">disks</a>, where all examples of this paragraph bear the <a href="subspace_(topology)" title="wikilink">subspace topology</a> induced by two-dimensional Euclidean space.</p>
<h2 id="formal-definition">Formal definition</h2>

<p>A <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topological space</a> <em>X</em> is said to be <strong>disconnected</strong> if it is the <a href="union_(set_theory)" title="wikilink">union</a> of two <a href="disjoint_sets" title="wikilink">disjoint</a> <a class="uri" href="nonempty" title="wikilink">nonempty</a> <a href="open_set" title="wikilink">open sets</a>. Otherwise, <em>X</em> is said to be <strong>connected</strong>. A <a class="uri" href="subset" title="wikilink">subset</a> of a topological space is said to be connected if it is connected under its subspace topology. Some authors exclude the <a href="empty_set" title="wikilink">empty set</a> (with its unique topology) as a connected space, but this article does not follow that practice.</p>

<p>For a topological space <em>X</em> the following conditions are equivalent:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>X</em> is connected.</li>
<li><em>X</em> cannot be divided into two disjoint nonempty <a href="closed_set" title="wikilink">closed sets</a>.</li>
<li>The only subsets of <em>X</em> which are both open and closed (<a href="clopen_set" title="wikilink">clopen sets</a>) are <em>X</em> and the empty set.</li>
<li>The only subsets of <em>X</em> with empty <a href="boundary_(topology)" title="wikilink">boundary</a> are <em>X</em> and the empty set.</li>
<li><em>X</em> cannot be written as the union of two nonempty <a href="separated_sets" title="wikilink">separated sets</a> (sets for which each is disjoint from the other's closure).</li>
<li>All continuous functions from <em>X</em> to {0,1} are constant, where {0,1} is the two-point space endowed with the discrete topology.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="connected-components">Connected components</h3>

<p>The <a href="maximal_element" title="wikilink">maximal</a> connected subsets (ordered by <a href="subset" title="wikilink">inclusion</a>) of a nonempty topological space are called the <strong>connected components</strong> of the space. The components of any topological space <em>X</em> form a <a href="partition_of_a_set" title="wikilink">partition</a> of <em>X</em>: they are <a href="disjoint_sets" title="wikilink">disjoint</a>, nonempty, and their union is the whole space. Every component is a <a href="closed_subset" title="wikilink">closed subset</a> of the original space. It follows that, in the case where their number is finite, each component is also an open subset. However, if their number is infinite, this might not be the case; for instance, the connected components of the set of the <a href="rational_number" title="wikilink">rational numbers</a> are the one-point sets, which are not open.</p>

<h3 id="disconnected-spaces">Disconnected spaces</h3>

<p>A space in which all components are one-point sets is called <a href="totally_disconnected" title="wikilink">totally disconnected</a>. Related to this property, a space <em>X</em> is called <strong>totally separated</strong> if, for any two distinct elements <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> of <em>X</em>, there exist disjoint <a href="neighborhood_(topology)" title="wikilink">open neighborhoods</a> <em>U</em> of <em>x</em> and <em>V</em> of <em>y</em> such that <em>X</em> is the union of <em>U</em> and <em>V</em>. Clearly any totally separated space is totally disconnected, but the converse does not hold. For example take two copies of the rational numbers <strong>Q</strong>, and identify them at every point except zero. The resulting space, with the quotient topology, is totally disconnected. However, by considering the two copies of zero, one sees that the space is not totally separated. In fact, it is not even <a href="Hausdorff_space" title="wikilink">Hausdorff</a>, and the condition of being totally separated is strictly stronger than the condition of being Hausdorff.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<ul>
<li>The closed interval [0, 2] in the <a href="Euclidean_space" title="wikilink">standard</a> <a href="subspace_topology" title="wikilink">subspace topology</a> is connected; although it can, for example, be written as the union of [0, 1) and [1, 2], the second set is not open in the chosen topology of [0, 2].</li>
<li>The union of [0, 1) and (1, 2] is disconnected; both of these intervals are open in the standard topological space [0, 1) ∪ (1, 2].</li>
<li>(0, 1) ∪ {3} is disconnected.</li>
<li>A <a href="convex_set" title="wikilink">convex set</a> is connected; it is actually <a href="simply_connected_set" title="wikilink">simply connected</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="Euclidean_space" title="wikilink">Euclidean plane</a> excluding the origin, (0, 0), is connected, but is not simply connected. The three-dimensional Euclidean space without the origin is connected, and even simply connected. In contrast, the one-dimensional Euclidean space without the origin is not connected.</li>
<li>A Euclidean plane with a straight line removed is not connected since it consists of two half-planes.</li>
<li>ℝ, The space of <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real numbers</a> with the usual topology, is connected.</li>
<li>If even a single point is removed from ℝ, the remainder is disconnected. However, if even a countable infinity of points are removed from ℝ<sup><em>n</em></sup>, where <em>n</em>≥2, the remainder is connected.</li>
<li>Any <a href="topological_vector_space" title="wikilink">topological vector space</a> over a connected field is connected.</li>
<li>Every <a href="discrete_topological_space" title="wikilink">discrete topological space</a> with at least two elements is disconnected, in fact such a space is <a href="totally_disconnected_space" title="wikilink">totally disconnected</a>. The simplest example is the <a href="discrete_two-point_space" title="wikilink">discrete two-point space</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li>On the other hand, a finite set might be connected. For example, the spectrum of a <a href="discrete_valuation_ring" title="wikilink">discrete valuation ring</a> consists of two points and is connected. It is an example of a <a href="Sierpiński_space" title="wikilink">Sierpiński space</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="Cantor_set" title="wikilink">Cantor set</a> is totally disconnected; since the set contains uncountably many points, it has uncountably many components.</li>
<li>If a space <em>X</em> is <a href="homotopy" title="wikilink">homotopy equivalent</a> to a connected space, then <em>X</em> is itself connected.</li>
<li>The <a href="topologist's_sine_curve" title="wikilink">topologist's sine curve</a> is an example of a set that is connected but is neither path connected nor locally connected.</li>

<h2 id="path-connectedness">Path connectedness</h2>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>This subspace of <strong>R</strong>² is path-connected, because a path can be drawn between any two points in the space.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A <strong><a href="path_(topology)" title="wikilink">path</a></strong> from a point <em>x</em> to a point <em>y</em> in a <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topological space</a> <em>X</em> is a <a href="continuous_function_(topology)" title="wikilink">continuous function</a> <em>f</em> from the <a href="unit_interval" title="wikilink">unit interval</a> [0,1] to <em>X</em> with <em>f</em>(0) = <em>x</em> and <em>f</em>(1) = <em>y</em>. A <strong>path-component</strong> of <em>X</em> is an <a href="equivalence_class" title="wikilink">equivalence class</a> of <em>X</em> under the <a href="equivalence_relation" title="wikilink">equivalence relation</a> which makes <em>x</em> equivalent to <em>y</em> if there is a path from <em>x</em> to <em>y</em>. The space <em>X</em> is said to be <strong>path-connected</strong> (or <strong>pathwise connected</strong> or <strong>0-connected</strong>) if there is exactly one path-component, i.e. if there is a path joining any two points in <em>X</em>. Again, many authors exclude the empty space.</p>

<p>Every path-connected space is connected. The converse is not always true: examples of connected spaces that are not path-connected include the extended <a href="long_line_(topology)" title="wikilink">long line</a> <em>L</em>* and the <em><a href="topologist's_sine_curve" title="wikilink">topologist's sine curve</a></em>.</p>

<p>However, subsets of the <a href="real_line" title="wikilink">real line</a> <strong>R</strong> are connected <a href="if_and_only_if" title="wikilink">if and only if</a> they are path-connected; these subsets are the <a href="interval_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">intervals</a> of <strong>R</strong>. Also, <a href="open_subset" title="wikilink">open subsets</a> of <strong>R</strong><sup><em>n</em></sup> or <strong>C</strong><sup><em>n</em></sup> are connected if and only if they are path-connected. Additionally, connectedness and path-connectedness are the same for <a href="finite_topological_space" title="wikilink">finite topological spaces</a>.</p>
<h2 id="arc-connectedness">Arc connectedness</h2>

<p>A space <em>X</em> is said to be <strong>arc-connected</strong> or <strong>arcwise connected</strong> if any two distinct points can be joined by an <em>arc</em>, that is a path <em>f</em> which is a <a class="uri" href="homeomorphism" title="wikilink">homeomorphism</a> between the unit interval [0, 1] and its image <em>f</em>([0, 1]). It can be shown any <a href="Hausdorff_space" title="wikilink">Hausdorff space</a> which is path-connected is also arc-connected. An example of a space which is path-connected but not arc-connected is provided by adding a second copy 0' of 0 to the nonnegative real numbers [0, ∞). One endows this set with a <a href="partially_ordered_set" title="wikilink">partial order</a> by specifying that 0'[0, <em>a</em>) = {<em>x</em> | 0 ≤ x [0', <em>a</em>) = {<em>x</em> | 0' ≤ <em>x</em> 1]] space but not a <a href="Hausdorff_space" title="wikilink">Hausdorff space</a>. Clearly 0 and 0' can be connected by a path but not by an arc in this space.</p>
<h2 id="local-connectedness">Local connectedness</h2>

<p>A topological space is said to be <strong><a href="Locally_connected_space" title="wikilink">locally connected</a> at a point</strong> <em>x</em> if every neighbourhood of <em>x</em> contains a connected open neighbourhood. It is <strong>locally connected</strong> if it has a <a href="base_(topology)" title="wikilink">base</a> of connected sets. It can be shown that a space <em>X</em> is locally connected if and only if every component of every open set of <em>X</em> is open. The <a href="topologist's_sine_curve" title="wikilink">topologist's sine curve</a> is an example of a connected space that is not locally connected.</p>

<p>Similarly, a topological space is said to be <strong></strong> if it has a base of path-connected sets. An open subset of a locally path-connected space is connected if and only if it is path-connected. This generalizes the earlier statement about <strong>R</strong><sup><em>n</em></sup> and <strong>C</strong><sup><em>n</em></sup>, each of which is locally path-connected. More generally, any <a href="topological_manifold" title="wikilink">topological manifold</a> is locally path-connected.</p>

</figure>

<p>The <a href="set_difference" title="wikilink">set difference</a> of connected sets is not necessarily connected. However, if <em>X</em>⊇<em>Y</em> and their difference <em>X</em>\<em>Y</em> is disconnected (and thus can be written as a union of two open sets <em>X1</em> and <em>X2</em>), then the union of <em>Y</em> with each such component is connected (i.e. <em>Y</em>∪<em>Xi</em> is connected for all <em>i</em>). <strong>Proof</strong>:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> By contradiction, suppose <em>Y</em>∪<em>X1</em> is not connected. So it can be written as the union of two disjoint open sets, e.g. <em>Y</em>∪<em>X1</em> = <em>Z1</em>∪<em>Z2</em>. Because <em>Y</em> is connected, it must be entirely contained in one of these components, say <em>Z1</em>, and thus <em>Z2</em> is contained in <em>X1</em>. Now we know that:</p>
<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd><em>X</em> = (<em>Y</em>∪<em>X1</em>)∪<em>X2</em> = (<em>Z1</em>∪<em>Z2</em>)∪<em>X2</em> = (<em>Z1</em>∪<em>X2</em>)∪(<em>Z2</em>∩<em>X1</em>)
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The two sets in the last union are disjoint and open in <em>X</em>, so there is a separation of <em>X</em>, contradicting the fact that <em>X</em> is connected.</p>
<h2 id="theorems">Theorems</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Main theorem</em>: Let <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> be topological spaces and let <em>f</em> : <em>X</em> → <em>Y</em> be a <a href="continuous_(topology)" title="wikilink">continuous function</a>. If <em>X</em> is (path-)connected then the <a href="image_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">image</a> <em>f</em>(<em>X</em>) is (path-)connected. This result can be considered a generalization of the <a href="intermediate_value_theorem" title="wikilink">intermediate value theorem</a>.</li>
<li>Every path-connected space is connected.</li>
<li>Every locally path-connected space is locally connected.</li>
<li>A locally path-connected space is path-connected if and only if it is connected.</li>
<li>The <a href="closure_(topology)" title="wikilink">closure</a> of a connected subset is connected.</li>
<li>The connected components are always <a href="closed_set" title="wikilink">closed</a> (but in general not open)</li>
<li>The connected components of a locally connected space are also open.</li>
<li>The connected components of a space are disjoint unions of the path-connected components (which in general are neither open nor closed).</li>
<li>Every <a href="Quotient_space_(topology)" title="wikilink">quotient</a> of a connected (resp. locally connected, path-connected, locally path-connected) space is connected (resp. locally connected, path-connected, locally path-connected).</li>
<li>Every <a href="product_topology" title="wikilink">product</a> of a family of connected (resp. path-connected) spaces is connected (resp. path-connected).</li>
<li>Every open subset of a locally connected (resp. locally path-connected) space is locally connected (resp. locally path-connected).</li>
<li>Every <a class="uri" href="manifold" title="wikilink">manifold</a> is locally path-connected.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="graphs">Graphs</h2>

<p><a href="Graph_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">Graphs</a> have path connected subsets, namely those subsets for which every pair of points has a path of edges joining them. But it is not always possible to find a topology on the set of points which induces the same connected sets. The <a href="cyclic_graph" title="wikilink">5-cycle</a> graph (and any <em>n</em>-cycle with <em>n</em>&gt;3 odd) is one such example.</p>

<p>As a consequence, a notion of connectedness can be formulated independently of the topology on a space. To wit, there is a category of connective spaces consisting of sets with collections of connected subsets satisfying connectivity axioms; their morphisms are those functions which map connected sets to connected sets . Topological spaces and graphs are special cases of connective spaces; indeed, the finite connective spaces are precisely the finite graphs.</p>

<p>However, every graph can be canonically made into a topological space, by treating vertices as points and edges as copies of the <a href="unit_interval" title="wikilink">unit interval</a> (see <a href="topological_graph_theory#Graphs_as_topological_spaces" title="wikilink">topological graph theory#Graphs as topological spaces</a>). Then one can show that the graph is connected (in the graph theoretical sense) if and only if it is connected as a topological space.</p>
<h2 id="stronger-forms-of-connectedness">Stronger forms of connectedness</h2>

<p>There are stronger forms of connectedness for <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topological spaces</a>, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there exist no two disjoint non-empty open sets in a topological space, <em>X</em>, <em>X</em> must be connected, and thus <a href="hyperconnected_space" title="wikilink">hyperconnected spaces</a> are also connected.</li>
<li>Since a <a href="simply_connected_space" title="wikilink">simply connected space</a> is, by definition, also required to be path connected, any simply connected space is also connected. Note however, that if the "path connectedness" requirement is dropped from the definition of simple connectivity, a simply connected space does not need to be connected.</li>
<li>Yet stronger versions of connectivity include the notion of a <a href="contractible_space" title="wikilink">contractible space</a>. Every contractible space is path connected and thus also connected.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, note that any path connected space must be connected but there exist connected spaces that are not path connected. The <a href="Comb_space" title="wikilink">deleted comb space</a> furnishes such an example, as does the above-mentioned <a href="topologist's_sine_curve" title="wikilink">topologist's sine curve</a>.</p>
