<h1>Linear algebraic group</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, a <strong>linear algebraic group</strong> is a <a class="uri" href="subgroup" title="wikilink">subgroup</a> of the group of invertible <em>n</em>×<em>n</em> <a href="Matrix_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">matrices</a> (under <a href="matrix_multiplication" title="wikilink">matrix multiplication</a>) that is defined by <a class="uri" href="polynomial" title="wikilink">polynomial</a> equations. An example is the <a href="orthogonal_group" title="wikilink">orthogonal group</a>, defined by the relation M<sup>T</sup>M = I where M<sup>T</sup> is the <a class="uri" href="transpose" title="wikilink">transpose</a> of M.</p>
<p>The main examples of linear algebraic groups are certain <a href="Lie_group" title="wikilink">Lie groups</a>, where the underlying <a href="Field_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">field</a> is the <a href="Real_number" title="wikilink">real</a> or <a href="Complex_number" title="wikilink">complex</a> field. (For example, every compact Lie group can be regarded as the group of points of a real linear algebraic group, essentially by the <a href="Peter–Weyl_theorem" title="wikilink">Peter–Weyl theorem</a>.) These were the first algebraic groups to be extensively studied. Such groups were known for a long time before their abstract algebraic theory was developed according to the needs of major applications. Compact Lie groups were considered by <a href="Élie_Cartan" title="wikilink">Élie Cartan</a>, <a href="Ludwig_Maurer" title="wikilink">Ludwig Maurer</a>, <a href="Wilhelm_Killing" title="wikilink">Wilhelm Killing</a>, and <a href="Sophus_Lie" title="wikilink">Sophus Lie</a> in the 1880s and 1890s in the context of <a href="differential_equation" title="wikilink">differential equations</a> and <a href="Galois_theory" title="wikilink">Galois theory</a>. However, a purely algebraic theory was first developed by , with <a href="Armand_Borel" title="wikilink">Armand Borel</a> as one of its pioneers. The <a href="Picard–Vessiot_theory" title="wikilink">Picard–Vessiot theory</a> did lead to algebraic groups.</p>
<p>The first basic theorem of the subject is that any <em>affine</em> <a href="algebraic_group" title="wikilink">algebraic group</a> is a linear algebraic group: that is, any <a href="affine_variety" title="wikilink">affine variety</a> V that has an algebraic group law has a <em>faithful</em> <a href="linear_representation" title="wikilink">linear representation</a>, over the same field, which is also a morphism of varieties. For example the <em>additive group</em> of an <em>n</em>-dimensional <a href="vector_space" title="wikilink">vector space</a> has a faithful representation as (<em>n</em>+1)×(<em>n</em>+1) matrices.</p>
<p>One can define the <a href="Lie_algebra" title="wikilink">Lie algebra</a> of an algebraic group purely algebraically (it consists of the <a href="dual_number" title="wikilink">dual number</a> points based at the identity element); and this theorem shows that we get a matrix Lie algebra. A linear algebraic group G consists of a finite number of irreducible components, that are in fact also the connected components: the one G<sup>o</sup> containing the identity will be a <a href="normal_subgroup" title="wikilink">normal subgroup</a> of G.</p>
<p>One of the first uses for the theory was to define the <a href="Chevalley_group" title="wikilink">Chevalley groups</a>.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>Since <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbb{G}_m = GL_1$</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbb{G}_m$</span> is a linear algebraic group. The embedding <span class="LaTeX">$x \mapsto \begin{bmatrix}
 1 & x \\
 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$</span> shows that <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbb{G}_a$</span> is a <a href="unipotent_group" title="wikilink">unipotent group</a>.</p>
<p>The deeper structure theory applies to connected linear algebraic groups G, and begins with the definition of <a href="Borel_subgroup" title="wikilink">Borel subgroups</a> B. These turn out to be maximal as connected solvable subgroups (i.e., subgroups with <a href="composition_series" title="wikilink">composition series</a> having as factors one-dimensional subgroups, all of which are groups of additive or multiplicative type); and also minimal such that G/B is a <a href="projective_variety" title="wikilink">projective variety</a>.</p>
<p>The most important subgroups of a linear algebraic group, besides its Borel subgroups, are its <a href="Algebraic_torus" title="wikilink">tori</a>, especially the maximal ones (similar to the study of <a href="Maximal_torus" title="wikilink">maximal tori in Lie groups</a>). If there is a maximal torus which <em>splits</em> (i.e. is isomorphic to a product of multiplicative groups), one calls the linear group <em>split</em> as well. If there is no splitting maximal torus, one studies the splitting tori and the maximal ones of them. If there is a rank at least 1 split torus in the group, the group is called <em>isotropic</em> and <em>anisotropic</em> if this is not the case. Any anisotropic or isotropic linear algebraic group over a field becomes split over the <a href="algebraic_closure" title="wikilink">algebraic closure</a>, so this distinction is interesting from the point of view of <a href="Algebraic_number_theory" title="wikilink">Algebraic number theory</a>.</p>
<h2 id="group-actions">Group actions</h2>
<p>Let <em>G</em> be a <a href="unipotent_group" title="wikilink">unipotent group</a> acting on an affine variety. Then every <em>G</em>-orbit in the variety is closed.</p>
<p>The <a href="Borel_fixed-point_theorem" title="wikilink">Borel fixed-point theorem</a> states that a connected solvable group acting on a non-empty <a href="complete_variety" title="wikilink">complete variety</a> admits a fixed point. The classical <a href="Lie–Kolchin_theorem" title="wikilink">Lie–Kolchin theorem</a> follows from the theorem applied to the flag variety.</p>
<h2 id="non-algebraic-lie-groups">Non-algebraic Lie groups</h2>
<p>There are several classes of examples of Lie groups that aren't the real or complex points of an algebraic group.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any Lie group with an infinite group of components G/G<sup>o</sup> cannot be realized as an algebraic group (see <a href="identity_component" title="wikilink">identity component</a>).</li>
<li>The center of a linear algebraic group is again a linear algebraic group. Thus, any group whose center has infinitely many components is not a linear algebraic group. An interesting example is the <a href="universal_cover" title="wikilink">universal cover</a> of <a href="SL2(R)" title="wikilink">SL<sub>2</sub>(<strong>R</strong>)</a>. This is a Lie group that maps infinite-to-one to SL<sub>2</sub>(<strong>R</strong>), since the <a href="fundamental_group" title="wikilink">fundamental group</a> is here <a href="infinite_cyclic" title="wikilink">infinite cyclic</a> - and in fact the cover has no faithful matrix representation.</li>
<li>The general <a href="solvable_Lie_group" title="wikilink">solvable Lie group</a> need not have a group law expressible by polynomials.</li>
