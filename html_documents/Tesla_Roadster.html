<p>The <strong>Tesla Roadster</strong> is a <a href="battery_electric_vehicle" title="wikilink">battery electric vehicle</a> (BEV) <a href="sports_car" title="wikilink">sports car</a> produced by the <a href="electric_car" title="wikilink">electric car</a> firm <a href="Tesla_Motors" title="wikilink">Tesla Motors</a> in <a class="uri" href="California" title="wikilink">California</a> between 2008 and 2012. The Roadster is the first highway-capable all-electric vehicle in <a href="Mass_production" title="wikilink">serial production</a> for sale in the United States in recent times. A replacement for the Roadster is expected for 2019.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Since 2008 Tesla has sold more than 2,400 Roadsters in 31 countries up to September 2012,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and most of the remaining Tesla Roadsters were sold in <a class="uri" href="Europe" title="wikilink">Europe</a> and <a class="uri" href="Asia" title="wikilink">Asia</a> during the fourth quarter of 2012.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Tesla began producing right-hand-drive Roadsters in early 2010.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The Roadster had a 2010 base price of  in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>,  in the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>,  in <a class="uri" href="Australia" title="wikilink">Australia</a>, and  in continental <a class="uri" href="Europe" title="wikilink">Europe</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> As an electric vehicle, the Roadster qualified for several <a href="Government_incentives_for_plug-in_electric_vehicles" title="wikilink">government incentives</a> in many nations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>The Roadster was the first production automobile to use <a href="lithium-ion_battery" title="wikilink">lithium-ion battery</a> cells and the first production <a href="Battery_electric_vehicle" title="wikilink">BEV</a> (all-electric) to travel more than  per charge.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The world distance record of  for a production electric car on a single charge was set by a Roadster on October 27, 2009, during the Global Green Challenge in outback Australia, in which it averaged a speed of 25 mph (40 km/h).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In March 2010, a Tesla Roadster became the first electric vehicle to win the Monte Carlo Alternative Energy Rally and the first to win any Federation Internationale de l'Automobile-sanctioned championship when a Roadster driven by former Formula One driver <a href="Érik_Comas" title="wikilink">Érik Comas</a> beat 96 competitors for range, efficiency and performance in the three-day, nearly  challenge.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>According to the <a href="United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="wikilink">U.S. EPA</a>, the Roadster can travel  on a single charge<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> of its lithium-ion battery pack, and can accelerate from  in 3.7 or 3.9 seconds depending on the model. The Roadster's efficiency, , was reported as 120 <a href="miles_per_gallon_gasoline_equivalent" title="wikilink">MPGe</a> (2.0 L/100 km). It uses 135 <a href="Watt-hour" title="wikilink">Wh</a>/km (21.7 kW·h/100 mi, 13.5 kW·h/100 km or 490 kJ/km) battery-to-wheel, and has an efficiency of 88% on average.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>The San Francisco International Auto Show, held on November 18–26, 2006, was the Tesla Roadster's first auto show. Tesla Roadsters have been featured in numerous subsequent auto shows, including international shows in Los Angeles, Detroit and Frankfurt.</p>

<p>The first Tesla Roadster was delivered in February 2008 to Tesla co-founder, chairman and product architect <a href="Elon_Musk" title="wikilink">Elon Musk</a>. The company produced 500 similar vehicles through June 2009. In July 2009, Tesla began production of its 2010 model-year Roadster—the first major product upgrade since Tesla began production in 2008.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Simultaneously, Tesla began producing the Roadster Sport, the first derivative of Tesla's proprietary, patented powertrain. The car accelerates from  in 3.7 seconds, compared to 3.9 seconds for the standard Roadster. Changes for the 2010 model-year cars include:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>An upgraded interior and push-button gear selector, including "executive interior" of exposed carbon fiber and premium leather, and clear-coat carbon fiber body accents.</li>
<li>Locking, push-button glove box wrapped in leather.</li>
<li>A centrally mounted video display screen to monitor real-time data, including estimated range, power regenerated, and the number of barrels of oil saved. This screen is visible to the driver and passenger.</li>
<li>Adjustable, custom-tuned suspension. The shock absorbers' response and anti-sway bars are manually adjustable.</li>
<li>More powerful and immediate heating, ventilation and air-conditioning.</li>
<li>More efficient motor and hand-wound stator. The new motor generates more kilowatts per amp—more mechanical power—than the predecessor.</li>
<li>A suite of sound-deadening measures to dramatically reduce noise, vibration and harshness. For instance, engineers added pellets to a member of the chassis side rail. These pellets expand by 50 times original volume during the adhesive heating cycle to eliminate rattles.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these features, except for the motor were available either as standard or as add-on option for the non-sport model.</p>

<p>Beginning mid-March 2010, Tesla Motors, in an effort to show off the practicality of its electric cars, sent one of its Roadsters around the world. Starting at the Geneva auto show, the Roadster completed its journey upon its arrival in Paris on September 28, 2010.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>In July 2010, Tesla introduced the "Roadster 2.5", the latest update of the Roadster.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> New features in Roadster 2.5 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new look, which includes a new front fascia with diffusing vents, and rear diffuser reflecting the future of Tesla design</li>
<li>Directional forged wheels available in both silver and black</li>
<li>New seats with improved comfort, larger more supportive bolsters and a new lumbar support system</li>
<li>Power control hardware that enables spirited driving in exceptionally hot climates</li>
<li>An optional 7" touchscreen display with back-up camera</li>
<li>Improved interior sound reduction including new front fender liner material make the cabin quieter</li>
</ul>

<p>The Roadster was the most expensive single prize ever offered to date on <em><a href="The_Price_Is_Right_(U.S._game_show)" title="wikilink">The Price Is Right</a></em>, in a playing of <a href="List_of_The_Price_Is_Right_pricing_games" title="wikilink">Golden Road</a> on April 22, 2010, in celebration of Earth Day. It was not won—according to the show, its price was US$112,845.</p>

<p>A Roadster was used as a promotional tool for <a href="sustainable_energy" title="wikilink">sustainable energy</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>Tesla produced the Roadster until January 2012, when its supply of <a href="Lotus_Cars" title="wikilink">Lotus</a> <a href="Glider_(automobiles)" title="wikilink">gliders</a> ran out, as its contract with <a href="Lotus_Cars" title="wikilink">Lotus Cars</a> for 2,500 gliders expired at the end of 2011.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Tesla stopped taking orders for the Roadster in the U.S. market in August 2011.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The next generation is expected to be introduced by 2018 and will not be based on the Lotus gliders but instead on a shortened version of the architecture developed for the <a href="Tesla_Model_S" title="wikilink">Tesla Model S</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Featuring new options and enhanced components, the 2012 Tesla Roadster is being sold in limited numbers only in Europe, Asia and Australia. Tesla's U.S. exemption for not having special two-stage passenger airbags expired for cars made after the end of 2011 so the last Roadsters could not be sold in the American market.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Also a total of 15 Final Edition Roadsters were produced to close the manufacturing cycle of Tesla's first electric car.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a>  the Roadster remained on sale in Europe and Asia<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> and , inventories were not yet depleted.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>Tesla announced an optional upgrade to current Roadsters, the Roadster 3.0 in December 2014. It will have a new battery pack, with capacity increased by 31% to 70kWh, a new areo kit designed to reduce drag, and new tires with lower <a href="rolling_resistance" title="wikilink">rolling resistance</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p>The Roadster was developed by Tesla Motors to mass-produce <a href="AC_Propulsion_tzero" title="wikilink">AC Propulsion's tzero concept car</a>. The production idea was conceived by <a href="Martin_Eberhard" title="wikilink">Martin Eberhard</a> and Marc Tarpenning who incorporated Tesla Motors in Delaware on July 1, 2003, to pursue the idea commercially.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> South African-born entrepreneur <a href="Elon_Musk" title="wikilink">Elon Musk</a> took an active role within the company starting in 2004, including investing US$7.5 million, overseeing Roadster product design from the beginning, and greatly expanding Tesla's long-term strategic sales goals to include developing mainstream vehicles after the sports car.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Musk became Tesla's Chairman of the Board in April 2004 and had helped recruit JB Straubel as chief technology officer in March 2004.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Musk received the <a href="Global_Green" title="wikilink">Global Green</a> 2006 product design award for the design of the Tesla Roadster, presented by <a href="Mikhail_Gorbachev" title="wikilink">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> and he received the 2007 Index Design award for the design of the Tesla Roadster.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> </p>

<p>Before Tesla had developed the Roadster's proprietary powertrain, the company licensed <a href="AC_Propulsion" title="wikilink">AC Propulsion</a>'s EV Power System design and Reductive Charging patent which covers integration of the charging electronics with the <a href="Inverter_(electrical)#Electric_vehicle_drives" title="wikilink">inverter</a>, thus reducing mass, complexity, and cost. Tesla then designed and built its own power electronics, motor, and other drivetrain components that incorporated this licensed technology from <a href="AC_Propulsion" title="wikilink">AC Propulsion</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Given the extensive redevelopment of the vehicle, Tesla Motors no longer licenses any proprietary technology from AC Propulsion. The Roadster's powertrain is unique.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p>On 11 July 2005, Tesla and British sports car maker Lotus entered an agreement about products and services based on the <a href="Lotus_Elise" title="wikilink">Lotus Elise</a>, where Lotus provided advice on designing and developing a vehicle as well as producing partly assembled vehicles,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> and amended in 2009.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> helped with basic chassis development. The Roadster has a parts overlap of roughly 6 percent with the <a href="Lotus_Elise" title="wikilink">Lotus Elise</a>. Tesla's designers chose to construct the body panels using <a href="resin_transfer_molded" title="wikilink">resin transfer molded</a> <a href="carbon_fiber_reinforced_plastic" title="wikilink">carbon fiber composite</a> to minimize weight; this choice makes the Roadster one of the least expensive cars with an entirely carbon fiber skin.</p>

<p>Several prototypes of the Tesla Roadster were produced from 2004 through 2007. Initial studies were done in two "<a href="test_mule" title="wikilink">test mule</a>" vehicles based on Lotus Elises equipped with all-electric drive systems. Ten Engineering Prototypes (EP1 through EP10) which led to many minor changes were then built and tested in late 2006 and early 2007. Tesla then produced at least 26 Validation Prototypes (VP1 through <a href="http://www.teslamotorsclub.com/showthread.php/429-Validation-Prototypes-(VPs)">VP26</a>) which were delivered beginning in March 2007. These final revisions were endurance and crash tested in preparation for series production.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<p>In August 2007, Martin Eberhard was replaced by an interim CEO, Michael Marks.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Marks accepted the temporary position while a recruitment was undertaken. In December 2007, Ze'ev Drori became the CEO and President of Tesla Motors. In October 2008, Musk succeeded Ze'ev Drori as CEO. Drori became Vice Chairman and left the company in December. In January 2008, the U.S. <a href="National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration" title="wikilink">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA) announced that it would grant a waiver of the <em>advanced</em> air bag rule<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> noting that the Tesla Roadster already includes standard <a href="air_bag" title="wikilink">air bags</a>; similar waivers have been granted to many other small volume manufacturers as well, including <a href="Lotus_Cars" title="wikilink">Lotus</a>, <a class="uri" href="Ferrari" title="wikilink">Ferrari</a>, and <a class="uri" href="Bugatti" title="wikilink">Bugatti</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Tesla delivered its first production car in February 2008 to Musk.</p>

<p>Tesla announced in early August 2009 that Roadster sales had resulted in overall corporate profitability for the month of July 2009.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The company said it earned approximately  on revenue of . Profitability arose primarily from improved gross margin on the 2010 Roadster, the second iteration of Tesla’s award-winning sports car. Tesla, which like all automakers records revenue when products are delivered, shipped a record 109 vehicles in July and reported a surge in new Roadster purchases.</p>

<p>Tesla, which signed a production contract with Group Lotus in 2007 to produce "gliders" (complete cars minus electric powertrain) for the Roadster, announced in early 2010 that Roadster production would continue until early 2012, in part due to tooling changes at Lotus' assembly plant in the UK.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

<p>Tesla cumulative production of the Roadster reached 1,000 cars in January 2010.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> The Roadster is an American car with a <a href="Vehicle_Identification_Number" title="wikilink">Vehicle Identification Number</a> common to all cars considered American manufactured, but it has parts from around the world. The body panels come from French supplier Sotira. These are sent from France to <a class="uri" href="Hethel" title="wikilink">Hethel</a>, U.K., where Tesla contracts with Lotus to build the Roadster's unique chassis.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> The Roadster shares roughly 6 percent of its components with the <a href="Lotus_Elise" title="wikilink">Lotus Elise</a>; shared components include the windshield, air bags, some tires, some dashboard parts, and suspension components. The Roadster's single-speed gearbox is made in Detroit to Tesla's specifications by Auburn Hills, Michigan-based supplier <a class="uri" href="BorgWarner" title="wikilink">BorgWarner</a>. Brakes and airbags are made by <a class="uri" href="Siemens" title="wikilink">Siemens</a> in <a class="uri" href="Germany" title="wikilink">Germany</a>, and some crash testing was conducted at Siemens as well.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

<p>For Roadsters bound for customers in North America, the chassis is then sent to Menlo Park, California, for final assembly. For Roadsters bound for customers in Europe or elsewhere outside of North America, the chassis is sent to a facility at Wymondham near Hethel, for final assembly. At these final assembly locations, Tesla employees install the entire powertrain, which consists of the battery pack, power electronics module, gearbox and motor. Tesla also performs rigorous "pre-delivery inspection" on every car before customers take ownership.</p>

<p>Tesla ordered 2,500 <a href="glider_(automobiles)" title="wikilink">gliders</a> from Lotus, which ended supplies in December 2011 when their contract expired.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Tesla ended production of the Roadster in January 2012.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3>

<p>Subsequent to completion of production car number one at Hethel, the company announced problems with <a href="transmission_(mechanics)" title="wikilink">transmission</a> reliability. The development transmission, with first gear enabled to accelerate  in 4 seconds, was reported to have a life expectancy of as low as only a few thousand miles. Tesla Motors' first two transmission suppliers were unable to produce transmissions, in quantity, that could withstand the gear-shift requirements of the high torque, high rpm electric motor. In December 2007, Tesla Motors announced plans to ship the initial Roadsters with the transmissions locked into second gear to provide  acceleration in 5.7 seconds. The first production car was not delivered with this interim solution; P1 has both transmission gears enabled. According to the plan, the initial transmissions were to be swapped out under warranty when the finalized transmission, power electronics module (PEM), and cooling system became available. The <a href="United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency#Fuel_economy_testing_and_results" title="wikilink">EPA range</a> of the car was also restated downward from . The downward revision was attributed to an error in equipment calibration at the laboratory that conducted the original test.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>During the first two months of production, Tesla produced a total of three Roadsters (P3/VINF002, P4/VINF004, and P5/VINF005). Production car # 1 (P1) and P2 were built prior to the start of regular series production, which began March 17, 2008.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></li>
<li>By September 10, 2008, Tesla had delivered 27 of the cars to customers. It was also reported that a newer, better transmission had been developed and that production of the car was hoped to reach 20 per week by December 2008, and 40 per week by March 2009.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Over the next 20 days, however, only 3 more cars had been delivered to customers which brought the total to 30 as of September 30, 2008.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></li>
<li>By November 19, 2008, more than 70 of the cars had been delivered to customers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></li>
<li>By December 9, 2008, the 100th car had been delivered to its customer.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></li>
<li>By February 11, 2009, 200 Roadsters had been produced.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn74" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></li>
<li>By April 2, 2009, 320 Roadsters had been delivered.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn75" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></li>
<li>In May 2009, Tesla issued a <a href="product_recall" title="wikilink">safety recall</a> for all 345 of its Roadsters that were manufactured before April 22, 2009. Tesla sent technicians to customers' homes to tighten the rear, inner hub flange bolts. Tesla Motors told customers that without this adjustment, the driver could lose control of the car and crash. The problem originated at the Lotus assembly line that builds the Roadster and Lotus is also recalling some of its own vehicles. Tesla reminded customers that millions of cars are recalled every year.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn76" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn77" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></li>
<li>By the end of May 2009, the 500th Roadster had been delivered.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn78" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></li>
<li>Tesla made its first profit ever in July 2009, when it shipped 109 vehicles, the most ever so far for a single month.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn79" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></li>
<li>By September 15, 2009, 700 Roadsters had been delivered.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn80" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></li>
<li>Tesla announced on January 13, 2010, that it had produced its 1,000th Roadster.

<p>The base price for the 2010 models, which began shipping to customers in July 2009, was US$109,000. The Roadster has a bumper-to-bumper 3-year,  warranty. Tesla also offers an extended powertrain warranty and a battery replacement warranty. Options ranging from colors to audio to high-power connectors for faster charging will increase the price.</p>

<p>In July 2009, Tesla announced that US consumers could finance the Roadster through Bank of America. Financing is available for up to 75 percent of the total vehicle purchase price. A customer approved for a 5-year financing term on a base Roadster could put down as little as US$20,000 before taxes and net of the US federal tax credit. The monthly payment would be approximately US$1,700 at a 5 percent annual percentage rate (APR). That monthly payment is typical for high performance, although the Roadster costs roughly US$4 to refuel and does not require traditional automotive maintenance, like fluid, belt, and spark plug changes. Unlike internal combustion engines, Teslas get a 100 percent waiver on sales, luxury and use taxes in at least four states, and they qualify for commuter lane privileges, free parking and free charging in many regions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn106" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>

<p>Tesla sells Roadsters directly to customers. It sells online, in 13 showrooms and over toll-free phone lines in North America and Europe. Tesla does not operate through franchise dealerships but operates company-owned stores. The company has said that it takes its retail cues from Apple, Starbucks and other non-automotive retailers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn107" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>

The ESS contains 6,831 <a href="lithium_ion_battery" title="wikilink">lithium ion</a> cells arranged into 11 "sheets" connected in series; each sheet contains 9 "bricks" connected in series; each "brick" contains 69 cells connected in parallel (11S 9S 69P). The cells are of the <a class="uri" href="18650" title="wikilink">18650</a> form-factor commonly found in <a class="uri" href="laptop" title="wikilink">laptop</a> batteries.

<p>The pack is designed to prevent catastrophic cell failures from propagating to adjacent cells (thermal runaway), even when the cooling system is off.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn145" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> Coolant is pumped continuously through the ESS both when the car is running and when the car is turned off if the pack retains more than a 90% charge. The coolant pump draws 146 watts.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn146" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn147" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn148" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn149" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>

<p>A full recharge of the battery system requires 3½ hours using the High Power Connector which supplies 70 amp, 240 volt electricity; in practice, recharge cycles usually start from a partially charged state and require less time. A fully charged ESS stores approximately 53 kWh of electrical energy at a nominal 375 volts and weighs .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn150" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn151" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a></p>

<p>Tesla Motors stated in February 2009 that the current replacement cost of the ESS is slightly under US$36,000, with an expected life span of 7 years/, and began offering owners an option to pre-purchase a battery replacement for US$12,000 today with the replacement to be delivered after seven years. The ESS is expected to retain 70% capacity after 5 years and  of driving ( driven each year). However, a July 2013 study found that even after 100,000 miles, Roadster batteries still have 80%–85% capacity and the only significant factor is mileage (not temperature)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn152" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> Tesla Motors provides a 3 year/36,000 mile warranty on the Roadster with an optional 4 year/50,000 mile extended warranty available at an "additional cost" (2008 Roadster buyers received the 4/50 extension at no cost while later purchasers need to pay).

<p>Charging times vary depending on the ESS's state-of-charge, the available voltage, and the available circuit breaker amp rating (<a href="Electric_current" title="wikilink">current</a>). In a best case scenario using a 240 V charger on a 90 A circuit breaker, Tesla documents a recharging rate of -of-range for each hour charging; a complete recharge from empty would require just under 4 hours. The slowest charging rate using a 120V outlet on a 15 A circuit breaker would add -of-range for each hour charging; a complete recharge from empty would require 48 hours.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn162" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="reviews">Reviews</h2>

<p>Tesla Roadster reviews can be grouped in two main categories: older reviews of "validation prototypes" (2006–2008), before Tesla began serial production and customer deliveries, and reviews on cars in serial production (2008–2010).</p>

<p>The global online auto review site Autoguide.com tested Tesla's fourth-generation car in October 2010. Autoguide editor Derek Kreindler said "The Tesla Roadster 2.5 S is a massively impressive vehicle, more spacecraft than sports car. Theories like global warming, peak oil and rising oil prices should no longer bring heart palpitations to car fans. The Tesla shows just how good zero-emissions “green” technology can be. Quite frankly, getting into a normal car at the end of the test drive was a major letdown. The whirr of the engine, the shove in the backside and the little roadster that seems to pivot around you is replaced by a grunting, belching, feedback-free driving experience". He continues on that "but for a $100,000 car, it could use some work" complaining of purposefully cheap work.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn203" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a></p>

<p>In the March 2010 print edition of British enthusiast magazine EVO (p. 120), editor Richard Meaden was the first to review the all-new right-hand-drive version of the Roadster. He said the car had "serious, instantaneous muscle". "With so much torque from literally no revs the acceleration punch is wholly alien. Away from traffic lights you'd murder anything, be it a 911 Turbo, GT-R or 599, simply because while they have to mess about with balancing revs and clutch, or fiddle with launch controls and invalid warranties, all you have to do is floor the throttle and wave goodbye".</p>

<p>In December 2009, Wall Street Journal editor Joseph White conducted an extended test-drive and determined that "you can have enormous fun within the legal speed limit as you whoosh around unsuspecting Camry drivers, zapping from 40 to 60 miles per hour in two seconds while the startled victims eat your electric dust". White, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, praised the car's environmental efficiency but said consumer demand reflected not the environmental attributes of the car but its performance. "The Tesla turns the frugal environmentalist aesthetic on its head. Sure, it doesn't burn petroleum, and if plugged into a wind turbine or a nuclear plant, it would be a very low-carbon machine. But anyone who buys one will get the most satisfaction from smoking someone's doors off. The Tesla's message is that "green" technology can appeal to the id, not just the superego".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn204" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a></p>

<p>In December 2009, MotorTrend was the first to independently confirm the Roadster Sport's reported 0 to 60 mph time of 3.7 seconds. (MotorTrend recorded 0 to 60 mph of 3.70 seconds; it recorded a quarter-mile test at 12.6 sec @ 102.6 mph.) Engineering Editor Kim Reynolds called the acceleration "breathtaking" and said the car confirms "Tesla as an actual car company. ...Tesla is the first maker to crack the EV legitimacy barrier in a century".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn205" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a></p>

<p>In November 2009, Automobile Magazine West Coast editor Jason Cammisa spent a week driving a production Tesla Roadster.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn206" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a> Cammisa was immediately impressed with the acceleration, saying the car "explodes off the line, pulling like a small jet plane. ... It's like driving a Lamborghini with a big V-12 revved over 6000 rpm at all times, waiting to pounce—without the noise, vibration, or misdemeanor arrest for disturbing the peace". He also took the car to Infineon Raceway in Sonoma, California, and praised the car for its robustness, saying the Roadster:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>"wins the Coolest Car I've Ever Driven award. Why? Despite the flat-out sprints, the drag racing, the donuts, the top-speed runs, and dicing through traffic like there's a jet pack strapped to the trunk, Pacific Gas and Electric—which generated power for the Tesla—released into the atmosphere the same amount of carbon dioxide as would a gasoline-powered car getting 99 mpg. And the Roadster didn't break. It didn't smoke, lock up, freeze, or experience <a href="Flux_capacitor" title="wikilink">flux-capacitor</a> failure. Over the past ten decades, no company has been able to reinvent the car—not General Motors with the EV1, not Toyota with the Prius. And now, a bunch of dudes from Silicon Valley have created an electric car that really works—as both an environmental fix and a speed fix".</p>

<p>In 2009 the Tesla Roadster was one of the Scandinavian Sports Car of the Year participants. In a comparison made by Nordic car magazines <a href="Tekniikan_Maailma" title="wikilink">Tekniikan Maailma</a> (Finland), <a href="Teknikens_Värld" title="wikilink">Teknikens Värld</a> (Sweden) and <a href="Bil_Magasinet" title="wikilink">Bil Magasinet</a> (Denmark), critics praised the torque of the car and a track car structure, but also highlighted more negative aspects such as a short battery life; they were unable to drive a full track lap in dry track conditions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn207" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a></p>

<p>In May 2009, Car and Driver technical editor Aaron Robinson wrote a review based on the first extended test-drive of a production Tesla Roadster. Robinson had the car for nearly a week at his home. He complained of "design anomalies, daily annoyances, absurd ergonomics, and ridiculous economics " and stated he never got to see if the car could go 240 miles on a single charge because the torturous seating forced him to stop driving the car. He also complained of Tesla increasing the car prices on those who had already made deposits and charging extra for previously free necessary components.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn208" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a></p>

<p>In February 2009, automotive critic Dan Neil of the Los Angeles Times called the production Tesla Roadster "a superb piece of machinery: stiff, well sorted, highly focused, dead-sexy and eerily quick". Neil said he had the car for 24 hours but "caned it like the Taliban caned Gillette salesmen and it never even blinked".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn209" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a></p>

<p>In February 2009, <em><a href="Road_and_Track" title="wikilink">Road and Track</a></em> tested another production vehicle and conducted the first independently verified metered testing of the Roadster. Engineering editor Dennis Simanitis said the testing confirmed what he called "extravagant claims", that the Roadster had a 4.0 s  acceleration and a  range. They said the Roadster felt like "an over-ballasted <a href="Lotus_Elise" title="wikilink">Lotus Elise</a>", but the weight was well-distributed, so the car remained responsive. "Fit and finish of our Tesla were exemplary", which <em>Road and Track</em> thought fit the target market. Overall, they considered it a "delight" to drive.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn210" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> Testing a pre-production car in early 2008, <em>Road and Track</em> said "The Tesla feels composed and competent at speed with great turn-in and transitioning response", though they recommended against it as a "primary grocery-getter".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn211" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a></p>

<p>In January 2009, automotive critic Warren Brown of the Washington Post called the production Roadster "a head-turner, jaw-dropper. It is sexy as all get-out". He described the feeling behind the wheel as, "Wheeeeeee! Drive a Tesla, even if you have to fly to Tesla's Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters, to get your hands on one for a day. ... If this is the future of the automobile, I want it".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn212" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a></p>

<p>In a review of a Roadster prototype before the cars were in serial production, <em><a href="Motor_Trend" title="wikilink">Motor Trend</a></em> gave a generally favorable review in March 2008, stating that, it was "undeniably, unbelievably efficient" and would be "profoundly humbling to just about any rumbling Ferrari or Porsche that makes the mistake of pulling up next to a silent, 105 mpg Tesla Roadster at a stoplight".; however, they detected a "nasty drive-train buck" during the test drive of an early Roadster with the older, two-speed transmission.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn213" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a></p>

<p>In a July 8, 2007, review of a prototype Roadster, <a href="Jay_Leno" title="wikilink">Jay Leno</a> wrote, "If you like sports cars and you want to be green, this is the only way to go. The Tesla is a car that you can live with, drive and enjoy as a sports car. I had a brief drive in the car and it was quite impressive. This is an electric car that is fun to drive".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn214" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a></p>

<p>In a November 27, 2006, review of a prototype Roadster in <em><a href="Slate_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Slate</a></em>, Paul Boutin wrote, "A week ago, I went for a spin in the fastest, most fun car I've ever ridden in—and that includes the Aston Martin I tried to buy once. I was so excited, in fact, that I decided to take a few days to calm down before writing about it. Well, my waiting period is over, I'm thinking rationally, and I'm still unbelievably stoked about the Tesla".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn215" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="top-gear-controversy"><em>Top Gear</em> controversy</h3>

<p>In the autumn of 2008, <em><a href="Top_Gear_(2002_TV_series)" title="wikilink">Top Gear</a>'s</em> <a href="Jeremy_Clarkson" title="wikilink">Jeremy Clarkson</a> reviewed two production Roadsters with the v1.5 transmission and described the driving experience with the exclamations "God Almighty! Wave goodbye to the world of dial-up, and say hello to the world of broadband motoring!" and "This car is biblically quick!" when comparing the acceleration versus a <a href="Lotus_Elise" title="wikilink">Lotus Elise</a>. Clarkson also noted, however, that the handling of the car was not as sharp as that of the Lotus Elise: "through the corners things are less rosy".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn216" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> <a href="The_Stig" title="wikilink">The Stig</a> recorded a time of 1:27.2 on a moist track, faster than a <a href="Nissan_370Z" title="wikilink">Nissan 370Z</a> on a dry track but slower than a <a href="Porsche_911" title="wikilink">Porsche 911</a> C2S also on a damp track, and also slower than the <a href="Lotus_Exige" title="wikilink">Lotus Exige</a>, Exige S and Evora.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn217" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a> The segment also claimed that the car's batteries would run flat after  of heavy use on a track<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn218" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a> and showed the car being pushed off the track.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn219" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a></p>

<p>Tesla Motors' spokesperson responded with statements in blogs and to mainstream news organizations that the cars provided to Top Gear never had less than 20% charge and never experienced brake failure.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn220" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a> In addition, neither car provided to Top Gear needed to be pushed off the track at any point.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn221" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a> Finally, although Clarkson showed a limp windmill and complained that it would take countless hours to refuel the car using such a source of electricity, the car can be charged from a 240 V outlet in as little as 3.5 hours.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn222" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn223" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a> After numerous blogs and several large news organizations began following the controversy,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn224" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a> the BBC issued a statement saying "the tested Tesla was filmed being pushed into the shed in order to show what would happen if the Roadster had run out of charge. Top Gear stands by the findings in this film and is content that it offers a fair representation of the Tesla's performance on the day it was tested", without addressing the other alleged misrepresentations that Tesla highlighted to the media.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn225" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a> After several weeks of increasing pressure and inquiries from the BBC, Clarkson wrote a blog for The Times, acknowledging that "Inevitably, the film we had shot was a bit of a mess. There was a handful of shots of a silver car. Some of a grey car". "But as a device for moving you and your things around, it is about as much use as a bag of muddy spinach".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn226" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a> In the months that followed Clarkson's acknowledgment, the original episode—including the misstatements—reran on BBC America and elsewhere without any editing, though the BBC is still looking into <em>Top Gear</em>{{'}}s journalism standards, according to British media reports.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn227" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a></p>

<p>On March 29, 2011, Tesla sued the programme over <a href="Defamation" title="wikilink">libel</a> and <a href="malicious_falsehood" title="wikilink">malicious falsehood</a>, while simultaneously launching the website TeslaVsTopGear.com. The current position of Tesla is found on their web page.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn228" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a> In a blogpost, producer <a href="Andy_Wilman" title="wikilink">Andy Wilman</a> has referred to Tesla's allegations as a "crusade" and argued the truth value of Tesla's statements.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn229" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a> On October 19, 2011, the High Court in London rejected Tesla's libel claim.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn230" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a> Tesla appealed High Court's decision to the Court of Appeals, where a 3-judge panel of Lords Justice upheld the lower court's decision, and ordered Tesla to pay the BBC's legal costs of £100,000.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn231" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a></p>
