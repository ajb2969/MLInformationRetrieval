<h1>Baire space (set theory)</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a href="set_theory" title="wikilink">set theory</a>, the <strong>Baire space</strong> is the <a href="Set_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">set</a> of all <a href="infinite_sequence" title="wikilink">infinite sequences</a> of <a href="natural_number" title="wikilink">natural numbers</a> with a certain <a class="uri" href="topology" title="wikilink">topology</a>. This space is commonly used in <a href="descriptive_set_theory" title="wikilink">descriptive set theory</a>, to the extent that its elements are often called ‚Äúreals.‚Äù It is often denoted <strong>B</strong>, <strong>N</strong><sup><strong>N</strong></sup>, œâ<sup>œâ</sup>, or <sup>œâ</sup>œâ. <a href="Yiannis_N._Moschovakis" title="wikilink">Moschovakis</a> denotes it

<p>The Baire space is defined to be the <a href="Cartesian_product" title="wikilink">Cartesian product</a> of <a href="countable_set" title="wikilink">countably infinitely</a> many copies of the set of natural numbers, and is given the <a href="product_topology" title="wikilink">product topology</a> (where each copy of the set of natural numbers is given the <a href="discrete_topology" title="wikilink">discrete topology</a>). The Baire space is often represented using the <a href="tree_(descriptive_set_theory)" title="wikilink">tree</a> of finite sequences of natural numbers.</p>

<p>The Baire space can be contrasted with <a href="Cantor_space" title="wikilink">Cantor space</a>, the set of infinite sequences of <a href="binary_digit" title="wikilink">binary digits</a>.</p>
<h2 id="topology-and-trees">Topology and trees</h2>

<p>The product topology used to define the Baire space can be described more concretely in terms of trees. The definition of the product topology leads to this characterization of <a href="base_(topology)" title="wikilink">basic open sets</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>If any finite set of natural number coordinates {<em>c</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> : <em>i</em> <em>i</em> a particular natural number value <em>v</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> is selected, then the set of all infinite sequences of natural numbers that have value <em>v</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> at position <em>c</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> for all <em>i</em> &lt; <em>n</em> is a basic open set. Every open set is a union of a collection of these.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>By moving to a different basis for the same topology, an alternate characterization of open sets can be obtained:</p>
<dl>
<dd>If a sequence of natural numbers {<em>w</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> : <em>i</em> <em>i</em> at position <em>i</em> for all <em>i</em> &lt; <em>n</em> is a basic open set. Every open set is a union of a collection of these.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Thus a basic open set in the Baire space specifies a finite initial segment œÑ of an infinite sequence of natural numbers, and all the infinite sequences extending œÑ form a basic open set. This leads to a representation of the Baire space as the set of all paths through the full tree œâ<sup>&lt;œâ</sup> of finite sequences of natural numbers ordered by extension. An open set is determined by some (possibly infinite) union of nodes of the tree; a point in Baire space is in the open set if and only if its path goes through one of these nodes.</p>

<p>The representation of the Baire space as paths through a tree also gives a characterization of closed sets. For any closed subset <em>C</em> of Baire space there is a subtree <em>T</em> of œâ<sup>&lt;œâ</sup> such that any point <em>x</em> is in <em>C</em> if and only if <em>x</em> is a path through <em>T</em>. Conversely, the set of paths through any subtree of œâ<sup>&lt;œâ</sup> is a closed set.</p>
<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>

<p>The Baire space has the following properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is a <a href="perfect_set" title="wikilink">perfect</a> <a href="Polish_space" title="wikilink">Polish space</a>, which means it is a <a href="complete_metric_space" title="wikilink">completely metrizable</a> <a href="second_countable" title="wikilink">second countable</a> space with no <a href="isolated_point" title="wikilink">isolated points</a>. As such, it has the same <a class="uri" href="cardinality" title="wikilink">cardinality</a> as the real line and is a <a href="Baire_space" title="wikilink">Baire space</a> in the topological sense of the term.</li>
<li>It is <a class="uri" href="zero-dimensional" title="wikilink">zero-dimensional</a> and <a href="totally_disconnected" title="wikilink">totally disconnected</a>.</li>
<li>It is not <a href="locally_compact" title="wikilink">locally compact</a>.</li>
<li>It is universal for Polish spaces in the sense that it can be mapped continuously onto any non-empty Polish space. Moreover, any Polish space has a <a href="dense_set" title="wikilink">dense</a> <a href="GŒ¥_set" title="wikilink">G<sub>Œ¥</sub></a> subspace <a class="uri" href="homeomorphic" title="wikilink">homeomorphic</a> to a G<sub>Œ¥</sub> subspace of the Baire space.</li>
<li>The Baire space is homeomorphic to the product of any finite or countable number of copies of itself.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="relation-to-the-real-line">Relation to the real line</h2>

<p>The Baire space is <a class="uri" href="homeomorphic" title="wikilink">homeomorphic</a> to the set of <a href="irrational_number" title="wikilink">irrational numbers</a> when they are given the <a href="subspace_topology" title="wikilink">subspace topology</a> inherited from the real line. A homeomorphism between Baire space and the irrationals can be constructed using <a href="continued_fraction" title="wikilink">continued fractions</a>.</p>

<p>From the point of view of <a href="descriptive_set_theory" title="wikilink">descriptive set theory</a>, the fact that the real line is connected causes technical difficulties. For this reason, it is more common to study Baire space. Because every Polish space is the continuous image of Baire space, it is often possible to prove results about arbitrary Polish spaces by showing that these properties hold for Baire space and by showing that they are preserved by <a href="continuous_functions" title="wikilink">continuous functions</a>.</p>

<p><strong>B</strong> is also of independent, but minor, interest in <a href="real_analysis" title="wikilink">real analysis</a>, where it is considered as a <a href="uniform_space" title="wikilink">uniform space</a>. The uniform structures of <strong>B</strong> and <strong>Ir</strong> (the irrationals) are different, however: <strong>B</strong> is <a href="complete_space" title="wikilink">complete</a> in its usual metric while <strong>Ir</strong> is not (although these spaces are homeomorphic).</p>
