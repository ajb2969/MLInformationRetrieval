<h1>QI (F series)</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The sixth series of <em><a class="uri" href="QI" title="wikilink">QI</a></em>, the <a class="uri" href="BBC" title="wikilink">BBC</a> comedy panel game television program hosted by <a href="Stephen_Fry" title="wikilink">Stephen Fry</a>, contains episodes themed around the letter "f". Series F was the first series to broadcast originally on <a href="BBC_One" title="wikilink">BBC One</a>, starting on 9 January 2009,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> with the exception of two episodes: one made for <a href="Children_in_Need" title="wikilink">Children in Need</a>, which was broadcast on <a href="BBC_Two" title="wikilink">BBC Two</a> on 14 November 2008, and a Christmas special, transmitted on 22 December 2008 on BBC One.</p>

<p>The rest of the series began on 9 January 2009 on BBC One, with an extended version of the show (known as <em>QI XL</em>) shown on BBC Two the following day.</p>
<h2 id="episodes">Episodes</h2>

<p>Whereas the previous series had seen only two new guests, series F featured new guests in most of the episodes. They were; <a href="Pam_Ayres" title="wikilink">Pam Ayres</a>, <a href="Marcus_Brigstocke" title="wikilink">Marcus Brigstocke</a>, <a href="Hugh_Dennis" title="wikilink">Hugh Dennis</a>, <a href="Reginald_D._Hunter" title="wikilink">Reginald D. Hunter</a>, <a href="Dom_Joly" title="wikilink">Dom Joly</a>, <a href="Ben_Miller" title="wikilink">Ben Miller</a>, <a href="John_Sergeant_(journalist)" title="wikilink">John Sergeant</a>, <a href="Emma_Thompson" title="wikilink">Emma Thompson</a> and <a href="Terry_Wogan" title="wikilink">Sir Terry Wogan</a>. Wogan was the first guest in the show's history to have previously received a knighthood.</p>

<p>Originally, the main bonus of the series, following on from the <a href="QI_(E_series)" title="wikilink">"E" Series'</a> <strong>"Elephant in the Room"</strong> was to be the <strong>"Fanfare"</strong>, where if any of the panelists said something particularly interesting a fanfare would sound. In the end, this only appeared in the final episode when <a href="David_Mitchell_(comedian)" title="wikilink">David Mitchell</a> was talking about French and Russian dinner service. It was styled as the "Teacher's Pet" prize. The only other time it was mentioned was in the extended version of "the Future" episode, when Stephen says that if any of the panelists knew the answer to why the <a href="Crypt_of_Civilization" title="wikilink">Crypt of Civilization</a> was to be opened in 8113 "I'll reward you with 2 fanfares".</p>

<p>The Children in Need special was the last edition of <em>QI</em> to be originally transmitted on BBC Two. All the others were shown on BBC One, starting with the Christmas special on 22 December 2008, with the series proper commencing on 9 January 2009. This transfer of networks also brought about the broadcasting of extended versions – called 'QI XL' – on BBC Two the following day (as per <em><a href="Have_I_Got_News_for_You" title="wikilink">Have I Got News for You</a></em> since 2007). This was the first series of <em>QI</em> not to be produced by John Lloyd. The role was taken by <a href="Piers_Fletcher" title="wikilink">Piers Fletcher</a>.</p>

<p>This series was the first to be broadcast in Australia, with the "Flotsam and Jetsam" episode being broadcast on 20 October 2009 on <a class="uri" href="ABC1" title="wikilink">ABC1</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>In discussing old wives' tales, David Mitchell is censored while saying "wanking" and then "wankers", which is not normally done on post-watershed broadcasts in Britain. One possible reason could be in the context of airing the episode as part of a broadcasting event traditionally aimed at a family audience, even though <em>QI</em> itself was broadcast in the usual time slot. (The sound effect used to cover up the words is not the usual bleep but a quacking sound, indicating that it may be removed from repeat screenings and the DVD release). Later in the episode, he plainly uses the word "shit" without censorship.</p>

<ul>
<li>In <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Native American</a> smoke signals, one puff usually meant "Hello" and two puffs usually meant "All's well". However, the meaning of signals did differ from place to place.</li>
<li>Communicating with <a href="Fan_(implement)" title="wikilink">paper fans</a> came about in the 19th century in France. A booklet was made of signals that users could make to each other – which was probably designed to increase fan sales. Fans were invented in China, and were brought into Europe via Italy by Marco Polo.</li>
<li>The main reason why there are fewer <a href="Fireman's_pole" title="wikilink">poles</a> nowadays is because most modern <a href="fire_station" title="wikilink">fire stations</a> are built with just one floor, so no pole is needed. <em>(forfeit: <a href="health_and_safety" title="wikilink">health and safety</a> gone mad)</em>.</li>
<li>"Fire eaters lung" is the condition caused when fire eaters inhale the flames. Fire-eating can cause terrible damage to the mouth, they hold toxic <a href="Fire_breathing#Fuel_risks" title="wikilink">lighter fluid</a> in their mouths so they can spit into the fire.</li>
<li>During the Second World War, there was a plan to make an aircraft carrier from substance made from ice and sawdust called "<a class="uri" href="Pykrete" title="wikilink">Pykrete</a>", as it is a stronger material than steel and does not melt. The proposed ship would have had guns on it that would fire super-cooled water to immobilise the enemy, and could be repaired using seawater, but the ship was never made because of the <a href="Normandy_Landings" title="wikilink">Normandy Landings</a>.</li>
<li><a href="Louis_Mountbatten,_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma" title="wikilink">Lord Louis Mountbatten</a> convinced <a href="Winston_Churchill" title="wikilink">Winston Churchill</a> to make a pykrete aircraft carrier after he threw some in Churchill's bath and showed him that it did not melt in his hot bath water.</li>
<li>The original <a href="The_Twelve_Days_of_Christmas_(song)" title="wikilink">Twelve Days of Christmas</a>, does not contain the famous theme "Five gooold rings". <a href="Frederic_Austin" title="wikilink">Frederic Austin</a> changed the normal line to the elongated version sang today, this version of the line is still under copyright by <a href="Novello_&amp;_Co" title="wikilink">Novello &amp; Co</a>. <em>(Forfeit: "Five goooold rings" (when the panellists were asked about everyone's favourite part of the traditional song))</em></li>

<li>When you blow out a candle, there is a drop in temperature that causes the fire to go out. Fire needs three things to work: oxygen, heat and fuel. <a href="Trick_candles" title="wikilink">Trick candles</a> use a wick that is made out of a material which burns at a low temperature, this is the reason they are hard to blow out.</li>
<li>Yes or no: "You know how sometimes it can be too cold to snow?" The answer is no <em>(forfeit: yes)</em>. While it is true that you need some <a class="uri" href="moisture" title="wikilink">moisture</a> in the air to snow and that there is less moisture when it is very cold, snow can not fall because it's too cold.</li>
