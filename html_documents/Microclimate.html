<p>A <strong>microclimate</strong> is a local atmospheric zone where the <a class="uri" href="climate" title="wikilink">climate</a> differs from the surrounding area. The term may refer to areas as small as a few square feet (for example a garden bed) or as large as many square miles.</p>

<p>Microclimates exist, for example, near bodies of water which may cool the local atmosphere, or in heavily urban areas where brick, concrete, and asphalt absorb the sun's energy, heat up, and reradiate that heat to the ambient air: the resulting <a href="urban_heat_island" title="wikilink">urban heat island</a> is a kind of microclimate. Microclimates can be found in most places. Another place this can occur is when the ground is made of tar or concrete, because these are man made objects, they do not take in much heat they mainly reradiate it.</p>

<p>Another contributing factor to microclimate is the slope or <a href="aspect_(geography)" title="wikilink">aspect</a> of an area. South-facing slopes in the <a href="Northern_Hemisphere" title="wikilink">Northern Hemisphere</a> and north-facing slopes in the <a href="Southern_Hemisphere" title="wikilink">Southern Hemisphere</a> are exposed to more direct sunlight than opposite slopes and are therefore warmer for longer.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p> The area in a developed industrial park may vary greatly from a wooded park nearby, as natural <a class="uri" href="flora" title="wikilink">flora</a> in parks absorb light and heat in leaves that a building roof or parking lot just radiates back into the air. Advocates of <a href="solar_energy" title="wikilink">solar energy</a> argue that widespread use of solar collection can mitigate overheating of urban environments by absorbing sunlight and putting it to work instead of heating the foreign surface objects.</p>

<p>A microclimate can offer an opportunity as a small <a href="growing_region" title="wikilink">growing region</a> for crops that cannot thrive in the broader area; this concept is often used in <a class="uri" href="permaculture" title="wikilink">permaculture</a> practiced in northern temperate climates. Microclimates can be used to the advantage of gardeners who carefully choose and position their plants. Cities often raise the average temperature by <a class="uri" href="zoning" title="wikilink">zoning</a>, and a sheltered position can reduce the severity of winter. <a href="Roof_garden" title="wikilink">Roof gardening</a>, however, exposes plants to more extreme temperatures in both summer and winter.</p>

<p>Tall buildings create their own microclimate, both by overshadowing large areas and by channeling strong winds to ground level. <a href="Wind_Engineering" title="wikilink">Wind effects</a> around tall buildings are assessed as part of a microclimate study.</p>

<p>Microclimates can also refer to purpose-made environments, such as those in a room or other enclosure. Microclimates are commonly created and carefully maintained in museum display and storage environments. This can be done using passive methods, such as <a href="silica_gel" title="wikilink">silica gel</a>, or with active microclimate control devices.</p>

<p>Usually, if the inland areas have a <a href="humid_continental_climate" title="wikilink">humid continental climate</a>, the coastal areas stay much milder during winter months, in contrast to the hotter summers. This is the case further north on the American west coast, such as in <a href="British_Columbia" title="wikilink">British Columbia</a>, <a class="uri" href="Canada" title="wikilink">Canada</a>, where <a class="uri" href="Vancouver" title="wikilink">Vancouver</a> has an <a href="oceanic_climate" title="wikilink">oceanic</a> wet winter with rare frosts, but inland areas that average several degrees warmer in summer have cold and snowy winters.</p>
<h3 id="soil-types">Soil types</h3>

<p>The type of soil found in an area can also affect microclimates. For example, soils heavy in clay can act like pavement, moderating the near ground temperature. On the other hand; if soil has many air pockets, then the heat could be trapped underneath the topsoil, resulting in the increased possibility of frost at ground level <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="sources-and-influences-on-microclimate">Sources and influences on microclimate</h2>

<p>Two main parameters to define a microclimate within a certain area are temperature and <a class="uri" href="humidity" title="wikilink">humidity</a>. A source of a drop in temperature and/or humidity can be attributed to different sources or influences. Often microclimate is shaped by a conglomerate of different influences and is a subject of <a href="microscale_meteorology" title="wikilink">microscale meteorology</a>.</p>
<h3 id="cold-air-pool">Cold air pool</h3>

<p>The well known examples of cold air pool (CAP) effect are Gstettneralm Sinkhole in Austria (lowest recorded temperature -53 C) <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and <a href="Peter_Sinks" title="wikilink">Peter Sinks</a> in the US.

<h3 id="americas">Americas</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="Northern_California" title="wikilink">Northern California</a> above the Bay Area is also well known for microclimates with massive differences of temperatures. The coastline typically averages between  and  during summer months along that coastline, but inland towns not far from the ocean such as <a href="Lakeport,_California" title="wikilink">Lakeport</a>, average as much as  in spite of being just around 40 miles inland. Even as far north as the <a href="Klamath_River" title="wikilink">Klamath River</a> valley around the <a href="41st_parallel_north" title="wikilink">41st parallel north</a> between <a href="Willow_Creek,_California" title="wikilink">Willow Creek</a> and <a href="Yreka,_California" title="wikilink">Yreka</a> averages such temperatures, which is extremely hot for such northerly areas. At this parallel, the temperature at the coast is such cool that Willow Creek beats <a href="Eureka,_California" title="wikilink">Eureka</a>'s all-time record temperature on average 79 times per year. This is in spite of the areas being less than 50 miles from each other. In oceanic stable terms it is like travelling from the summers in the north of <a class="uri" href="England" title="wikilink">England</a> to the south of <a class="uri" href="Spain" title="wikilink">Spain</a> in a fraction of the distance.
<ul>
<li><a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a> is a city with microclimates and submicroclimates. Due to the city's varied topography and influence from the prevailing summer marine layer, weather conditions can vary by as much as 9 °F (5 °C) from block to block. The <a href="Noe_Valley" title="wikilink">Noe Valley</a> district for example, is typically warmer and sunnier than adjacent areas because surrounding hills block some of the cool fog from the Pacific.</li>
<li>The region as a whole, known as the <a href="San_Francisco_Bay_area" title="wikilink">San Francisco Bay area</a> can have a wide range of extremes in temperature. In the basins and valleys adjoining the coast, climate is subject to wide variations within short distances as a result of the influence of topography on the circulation of marine air. The San Francisco Bay Area offers many varieties of climate within a few miles. In the Bay area, for example, the average maximum temperature in July is about  at <a href="Half_Moon_Bay,_California" title="wikilink">Half Moon Bay</a> on the coast,  at <a href="Walnut_Creek,_California" title="wikilink">Walnut Creek</a> only  inland, and  at <a href="Tracy,_California" title="wikilink">Tracy</a>, just  inland.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="San_Diego" title="wikilink">San Diego</a> areas are also subject to phenomena typical of a microclimate. The temperatures can vary as much as 18 °F (10 °C) between inland areas and the coast, with a temperature gradient of over one degree per mile (1.6 km) from the coast inland. Hills and mountains can also block coastal air masses. The <a href="San_Fernando_Valley" title="wikilink">San Fernando Valley</a> is usually much warmer in summer than most of Los Angeles, because the <a href="Santa_Monica_Mountains" title="wikilink">Santa Monica Mountains</a> usually block the cool ocean breezes and fog. Southern California has also a weather phenomenon called "June Gloom" or "May Grey", which sometimes gives overcast or foggy skies in the morning at the coast, but usually gives sunny skies by noon, during late spring and early summer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="Calgary,_Alberta" title="wikilink">Calgary, Alberta</a>, is also known for its microclimates. Especially notable are the differences between the downtown and river valley/flood plain regions and the areas to the west and north. This is largely due to an elevation difference within the city's boundaries of over , but can also be attributed somewhat, to the effects of the seasonal <a href="Chinook_wind" title="wikilink">Chinooks</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="Halifax_Regional_Municipality" title="wikilink">Halifax, Nova Scotia</a>, also has numerous microclimates. Coastal temperatures and weather conditions can differ considerably from areas located just 5–15 km inland. This is true in all seasons. Varying elevations are common throughout the city, and it is even possible to experience several microclimates while travelling on a single highway due to these changing elevations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="Chesapeake_Bay" title="wikilink">Chesapeake Bay</a>, is also known for its subtropical microclimate. It is most notable for its mild climatic effects on the area east and west of the lowlands of Maryland and Delmarva. Having over 64,000 square miles of water; (most of which is a mix of fresh and salt water) creates higher levels of humidity and heat in the spring and summer months. An example of this effect is the survival of tropical palm trees and plants such as water hyacinths<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> in the area.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></li>
