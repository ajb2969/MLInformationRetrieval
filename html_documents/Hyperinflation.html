<p>In economics, <strong>hyperinflation</strong> occurs when a country experiences very high and usually accelerating rates of <a class="uri" href="inflation" title="wikilink">inflation</a>, rapidly eroding the <a href="Real_versus_nominal_value_(economics)" title="wikilink">real value</a> of the local <a class="uri" href="currency" title="wikilink">currency</a>, and causing the population to minimize their holdings of the local money. The population normally switches to holding relatively stable foreign currencies. Under such conditions, the general <a href="price_level" title="wikilink">price level</a> within an economy increases rapidly as the official currency quickly loses real value.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The value of economic items remains relatively more stable in terms of foreign currencies.</p>

<p>Unlike low inflation, where the process of rising prices is protracted and not generally noticeable except by studying past market prices, hyperinflation sees a rapid and continuing increase in nominal prices and in the <a href="money_supply" title="wikilink">supply of money</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and the nominal cost of goods. But typically the general price level rises even more rapidly than the money supply since people try to get rid of the devaluing money as quickly as possible. The real stock of money, that is the amount of circulating money divided by the price level, decreases.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Hyperinflations are usually caused by large persistent government deficits financed primarily by <a href="money_creation" title="wikilink">money creation</a> (rather than <a class="uri" href="taxation" title="wikilink">taxation</a> or <a href="Government_borrowing" title="wikilink">borrowing</a>). As such, hyperinflation is often associated with wars, their aftermath, sociopolitical upheavals, or other crises that make it difficult for the government to tax the population. A sharp decrease in real tax revenue coupled with a strong need to maintain the status quo, together with an inability or unwillingness to borrow, can lead a country into hyperinflation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>

<p>In 1956, <a href="Phillip_D._Cagan" title="wikilink">Phillip Cagan</a> wrote <em>The Monetary Dynamics of Hyperinflation</em>, the book often regarded as the first serious study of hyperinflation and its effects<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> (though "The Economics of Inflation" by C. Bresciani-Turroni on the German hyperinflation was published in Italian in 1931). In his book, Cagan defined a hyperinflationary episode as starting in the month that the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50%, and as ending when the monthly inflation rate drops below 50% and stays that way for at least a year.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Economists usually follow <a href="Phillip_D._Cagan" title="wikilink">Cagan</a>’s description that hyperinflation occurs when the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50%.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>The <a href="International_Accounting_Standards_Board" title="wikilink">International Accounting Standards Board</a> has issued guidance on accounting rules in a hyperinflationary environment. It does not establish an absolute rule on when hyperinflation arises. Instead, it lists factors that indicate the existence of hyperinflation:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The general population prefers to keep its wealth in non-monetary assets or in a relatively stable foreign currency. Amounts of local currency held are immediately invested to maintain purchasing power</li>
<li>The general population regards monetary amounts not in terms of the local currency but in terms of a relatively stable foreign currency. Prices may be quoted in that currency;</li>
<li>Sales and purchases on credit take place at prices that compensate for the expected loss of purchasing power during the credit period, even if the period is short;</li>
<li>Interest rates, wages, and prices are linked to a price index; and</li>
<li>The cumulative inflation rate over three years approaches, or exceeds, 100%.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="causes">Causes</h2>

<p>There are a number of theories on the causes of high and/or hyper inflation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> But nearly all hyperinflations have been caused by government budget deficits financed by money creation. After an analysis of 29 hyperinflations (following Cagan's definition) Bernholz concludes that at least 25 of them have been caused in this way.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Moreover, a necessary condition for hyperinflation has been the existence of fiat money not convertible at a fixed parity into gold or silver. This is suggested by the fact that most known hyperinflations in history with some exceptions, such as the French hyperinflation of 1789-1796, occurred after the break-down of the gold standard during World War I. The French hyperinflation also took place after the introduction of an nonconvertible paper money, the assignats.</p>
<h3 id="supply-shocks">Supply shocks</h3>

<p>This theory, based on historical analysis, claims that past hyperinflations were caused by some sort of extreme negative <a href="supply_shock" title="wikilink">supply shock</a>, often but not always associated with wars, the breakdown of the communist system or natural disasters.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="money-supply">Money supply</h3>

<p>This theory claims that hyperinflation occurs when there is a continuing (and often accelerating) rapid increase in the amount of money that is not supported by a corresponding growth in the output of goods and services.</p>

<p>The price increases that result from the rapid <a href="money_creation" title="wikilink">money creation</a> creates a vicious circle, requiring ever growing amounts of new money creation to fund government deficits. Hence both <a href="monetary_inflation" title="wikilink">monetary inflation</a> and price inflation proceed at a rapid pace. Such rapidly increasing prices cause widespread unwillingness of the local population to hold the local currency as it rapidly loses its buying power. Instead they quickly spend any money they receive, which increases the <a href="velocity_of_money" title="wikilink">velocity of money</a> flow; this in turn causes further acceleration in prices. This means that the increase in the price level is greater than that of the money supply.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The real stock of money, M/P, decreases. Here M refers to the money stock and P to the price level.</p>

<p>This results in an imbalance between the <a href="supply_and_demand" title="wikilink">supply and demand</a> for the money (including currency and bank deposits), causing rapid inflation. Very high inflation rates can result in a loss of confidence in the currency, similar to a <a href="bank_run" title="wikilink">bank run</a>. Usually, the excessive money supply growth results from the government being either unable or unwilling to fully finance the government budget through taxation or borrowing, and instead it finances the government budget deficit through the printing of money.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>Governments have sometimes resorted to excessively loose monetary policy, as it allows a government to devalue its debts and reduce (or avoid) a tax increase. Inflation is effectively a <a href="regressive_tax" title="wikilink">regressive tax</a> on the users of money,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> but less overt than levied taxes and is therefore harder to understand by ordinary citizens. Inflation can obscure quantitative assessments of the true cost of living, as published price indices only look at data in retrospect, so may increase only months later. <a href="Monetary_inflation" title="wikilink">Monetary inflation</a> can become hyperinflation if monetary authorities fail to fund increasing government expenses from <a class="uri" href="taxes" title="wikilink">taxes</a>, <a href="government_debt" title="wikilink">government debt</a>, cost cutting, or by other means, because either</p>
<ul>
<li>during the time between recording or levying taxable transactions and collecting the taxes due, the value of the taxes collected falls in real value to a small fraction of the original taxes receivable; or</li>
<li>government debt issues fail to find buyers except at very deep discounts; or</li>
<li>a combination of the above.</li>
</ul>

<p>Theories of hyperinflation generally look for a relationship between <a class="uri" href="seigniorage" title="wikilink">seigniorage</a> and the <a href="inflation_tax" title="wikilink">inflation tax</a>. In both Cagan's model and the neo-classical models, a tipping point occurs when the increase in money supply or the drop in the monetary base makes it impossible for a government to improve its financial position. Thus when <a href="fiat_money" title="wikilink">fiat money</a> is printed, government obligations that are not denominated in money increase in cost by more than the value of the money created.</p>

<p>From this, it might be wondered why any rational government would engage in actions that cause or continue hyperinflation. One reason for such actions is that often the alternative to hyperinflation is either <a href="Depression_(economics)" title="wikilink">depression</a> or military defeat. The root cause is a matter of more dispute. In both <a href="classical_economics" title="wikilink">classical economics</a> and <a class="uri" href="monetarism" title="wikilink">monetarism</a>, it is always the result of the monetary authority irresponsibly borrowing money to pay all its expenses. These models focus on the unrestrained <a class="uri" href="seigniorage" title="wikilink">seigniorage</a> of the monetary authority, and the gains from the <a href="inflation_tax" title="wikilink">inflation tax</a>.</p>

</figure>

<p>In neo-classical economic theory, hyperinflation is rooted in a deterioration of the <a href="monetary_base" title="wikilink">monetary base</a>, that is the confidence that there is a store of value which the currency will be able to command later. In this model, the perceived risk of holding currency rises dramatically, and sellers demand increasingly high premiums to accept the currency. This in turn leads to a greater fear that the currency will collapse, causing even higher premiums. One example of this is during periods of warfare, civil war, or intense internal conflict of other kinds: governments need to do whatever is necessary to continue fighting, since the alternative is defeat. Expenses cannot be cut significantly since the main outlay is armaments. Further, a civil war may make it difficult to raise taxes or to collect existing taxes. While in peacetime the deficit is financed by selling bonds, during a war it is typically difficult and expensive to borrow, especially if the war is going poorly for the government in question. The banking authorities, whether central or not, "monetize" the deficit, printing money to pay for the government's efforts to survive. The hyperinflation under the <a href="Chinese_Nationalists" title="wikilink">Chinese Nationalists</a> from 1939 to 1945 is a classic example of a government printing money to pay civil war costs. By the end, currency was flown in over the Himalayas, and then old currency was flown out to be destroyed.</p>

<p>Hyperinflation is regarded as a complex phenomenon and one explanation may not be applicable to all cases. However, in both of these models, whether loss of confidence comes first, or central bank <a class="uri" href="seigniorage" title="wikilink">seigniorage</a>, the other phase is ignited. In the case of rapid expansion of the money supply, prices rise rapidly in response to the increased supply of money relative to the supply of goods and services, and in the case of loss of confidence, the monetary authority responds to the risk premiums it has to pay by "running the printing presses."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the immense acceleration process that occurs during hyperinflation (such as during the German hyperinflation of 1922/23) still remains unclear and unpredictable. The transformation of an inflationary development into the hyperinflation has to be identified as a very complex phenomenon, which could be a further advanced research avenue of the <a href="complexity_economics" title="wikilink">complexity economics</a> in conjunction with research areas like <a href="mass_hysteria" title="wikilink">mass hysteria</a>, <a href="bandwagon_effect" title="wikilink">bandwagon effect</a>, social brain and <a href="mirror_neurons" title="wikilink">mirror neurons</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="models">Models</h3>

<p>Since hyperinflation is visible as a monetary effect, models of hyperinflation center on the demand for money. Economists see both a rapid increase in the <a href="money_supply" title="wikilink">money supply</a> and an increase in the <a href="velocity_of_money" title="wikilink">velocity of money</a> if the (monetary) inflating is not stopped. Either one, or both of these together are the root causes of inflation and hyperinflation. A dramatic increase in the velocity of money as the cause of hyperinflation is central to the "crisis of confidence" model of hyperinflation, where the risk premium that sellers demand for the paper currency over the nominal value grows rapidly. The second theory is that there is first a radical increase in the amount of circulating medium, which can be called the "monetary model" of hyperinflation. In either model, the second effect then follows from the first—either too little confidence forcing an increase in the money supply, or too much money destroying confidence.</p>

<p>In the <em>confidence model</em>, some event, or series of events, such as defeats in battle, or a run on stocks of the specie which back a currency, removes the belief that the authority issuing the money will remain solvent—whether a bank or a government. Because people do not want to hold notes which may become valueless, they want to spend them. Sellers, realizing that there is a higher risk for the currency, demand a greater and greater premium over the original value. Under this model, the method of ending hyperinflation is to change the backing of the currency, often by issuing a completely new one. War is one commonly cited cause of crisis of confidence, particularly losing in a war, as occurred during Napoleonic Vienna, and capital flight, sometimes because of "contagion" is another. In this view, the increase in the circulating medium is the result of the government attempting to buy time without coming to terms with the root cause of the lack of confidence itself.</p>

<p>In the <em>monetary model</em>, hyperinflation is a <a href="positive_feedback" title="wikilink">positive feedback</a> cycle of rapid monetary expansion. It has the same cause as all other inflation: money-issuing bodies, central or otherwise, produce currency to pay spiralling costs, often from lax fiscal policy, or the mounting costs of warfare. When businesspeople perceive that the issuer is committed to a policy of rapid currency expansion, they mark up prices to cover the expected decay in the currency's value. The issuer must then accelerate its expansion to cover these prices, which pushes the currency value down even faster than before. According to this model the issuer cannot "win" and the only solution is to abruptly stop expanding the currency. Unfortunately, the end of expansion can cause a severe financial shock to those using the currency as expectations are suddenly adjusted. This policy, combined with reductions of pensions, wages, and government outlays, formed part of the <a href="Washington_consensus" title="wikilink">Washington consensus</a> of the 1990s.</p>

<p>Whatever the cause, hyperinflation involves both the supply and <a href="velocity_of_money" title="wikilink">velocity of money</a>. Which comes first is a matter of debate, and there may be no universal story that applies to all cases. But once the hyperinflation is established, the pattern of increasing the money stock, by whichever agencies are allowed to do so, is universal. Because this practice increases the supply of currency without any matching increase in demand for it, the price of the currency, that is the exchange rate, naturally falls relative to other currencies. Inflation becomes hyperinflation when the increase in money supply turns specific areas of pricing power into a general frenzy of spending quickly before money becomes worthless. The purchasing power of the currency drops so rapidly that holding cash for even a day is an unacceptable loss of purchasing power. As a result, no one holds currency, which increases the velocity of money, and worsens the crisis.</p>

<p>Because rapidly rising prices undermine the role of money as a <a href="store_of_value" title="wikilink">store of value</a>, people try to spend it on real goods or services as quickly as possible. Thus, the monetary model predicts that the velocity of money will increase as a result of an excessive increase in the money supply. At the point when money velocity and prices rapidly accelerate in a <a href="Virtuous_circle_and_vicious_circle#Example_in_macroeconomics" title="wikilink">vicious circle</a>, hyperinflation is out of control, because ordinary policy mechanisms, such as increasing reserve requirements, raising interest rates, or cutting government spending will be ineffective and be responded to by shifting away from the rapidly devalued money and towards other means of exchange.</p>

<p>During a period of hyperinflation, bank runs, loans for 24-hour periods, switching to alternate currencies, the return to use of gold or silver or even barter become common. Many of the people who hoard gold today expect hyperinflation, and are hedging against it by holding specie. There may also be extensive <a href="capital_flight" title="wikilink">capital flight</a> or flight to a "hard" currency such as the US dollar. This is sometimes met with <a href="capital_controls" title="wikilink">capital controls</a>, an idea which has swung from standard, to anathema, and back into semi-respectability. All of this constitutes an economy which is operating in an "abnormal" way, which may lead to decreases in real production. If so, that intensifies the hyperinflation, since it means that the amount of goods in "too much money chasing too few goods" formulation is also reduced. This is also part of the vicious circle of hyperinflation.</p>

<p>Once the vicious circle of hyperinflation has been ignited, dramatic policy means are almost always required. Simply raising interest rates is insufficient. Bolivia, for example, underwent a period of hyperinflation in 1985, where prices increased 12,000% in the space of less than a year. The government raised the price of gasoline, which it had been selling at a huge loss to quiet popular discontent, and the hyperinflation came to a halt almost immediately, since it was able to bring in hard currency by selling its oil abroad. The crisis of confidence ended, and people returned deposits to banks. The German hyperinflation (1919–November 1923) was ended by producing a currency based on assets loaned against by banks, called the <a href="German_rentenmark" title="wikilink">Rentenmark</a>. Hyperinflation often ends when a civil conflict ends with one side winning.</p>

<p>Although <a href="incomes_policies" title="wikilink">wage and price controls</a> are sometimes used to control or prevent inflation, no episode of hyperinflation has been ended by the use of price controls alone, because price controls that force merchants to sell at prices far below their restocking costs result in shortages that cause prices to rise still further.</p>

<p><a href="Nobel_Prize_in_Economics" title="wikilink">Nobel prize</a> winner <a href="Milton_Friedman" title="wikilink">Milton Friedman</a> said "We economists don't know much, but we do know how to create a shortage. If you want to create a shortage of tomatoes, for example, just pass a law that retailers can't sell tomatoes for more than two cents per pound. Instantly you'll have a tomato shortage. It's the same with oil or gas."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="effects">Effects</h2>

<p>Hyperinflation effectively wipes out the purchasing power of private and public savings, distorts the economy in favor of the hoarding of real assets, causes the monetary base, whether <a href="money" title="wikilink">specie</a> or hard currency, to flee the country, and makes the afflicted area anathema to investment. But one of the most important characteristics of hyperinflation is the accelerating substitution of the inflating money by stable money, gold and silver in former times, but relatively stable foreign currencies after the breakdown of the gold or silver standards (<a href="Adolphe_Thiers" title="wikilink">Adolphe Thiers</a>'s <a href="Gresham's_law#Reverse_of_Gresham.27s_Law_.28Thiers.27_Law.29" title="wikilink">Thiers' Law</a>). If inflation is high enough all government regulations like heavy penalties and fines often combined with exchange controls cannot prevent this currency substitution. As a consequence the inflating currency is usually heavily undervalued compared to stable foreign money and in terms of purchasing power parity. As a consequence foreigners can live cheaply and buy at cheap prices in the countries hit by high inflation. It follows that governments who do not succeed to engineer in time a successful currency reform have finally to legalize the stable foreign currencies (or formerly gold and silver) which is threatening to fully substitute the inflating money. Otherwise their tax revenues including the inflation tax will approach zero.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The last hyperinflation where this process could be observed, took place in Zimbabwe in the first decade of the 21st century. In this case the local money was mainly driven out by the US dollar and the South African rand.</p>

<p>Enactment of price controls to prevent discounting the value of <a href="paper_money" title="wikilink">paper money</a> relative to gold, silver, <a href="hard_currency" title="wikilink">hard currency</a>, or commodities, fail to force acceptance of a paper money which lacks intrinsic value. If the entity responsible for printing a currency promotes excessive money printing, with other factors contributing a reinforcing effect, hyperinflation usually continues. Hyperinflation is generally associated with <a href="paper_money" title="wikilink">paper money</a>, which can easily be used to increase the money supply: add more zeros to the plates and print, or even stamp old notes with new numbers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Historically, there have been numerous episodes of hyperinflation in various countries followed by a return to "hard money". Older economies would revert to <a href="hard_currency" title="wikilink">hard currency</a> and <a href="barter_(economics)" title="wikilink">barter</a> when the circulating medium became excessively devalued, generally following a "run" on the <a href="store_of_value" title="wikilink">store of value</a>.</p>

<p>Much attention on hyperinflation centers on the effect on savers whose investment becomes worthless. Academic economists seem not to have devoted much study on the (positive) effect on debtors. This may be due to the widespread perception that consistently saving a portion of one's income in monetary investments such as bonds or interest-bearing accounts is almost always a wise policy, and usually beneficial to the society of the savers. By contrast, incurring large or long-term debts (though sometimes unavoidable) is viewed as often resulting from irresponsibility or self-indulgence. Interest rate changes often cannot keep up with hyperinflation or even high inflation, certainly with contractually fixed interest rates. (For example, in the 1970s in the United Kingdom inflation reached 25% per annum, yet interest rates did not rise above 15%—and then only briefly—and many fixed interest rate loans existed). Contractually there is often no bar to a debtor clearing his long term debt with "hyperinflated-cash" nor could a lender simply somehow suspend the loan. "Early redemption penalties" were (and still are) often based on a penalty of <em>x</em> months of interest/payment; again no real bar to paying off what had been a large loan. In interwar Germany, for example, much private and corporate debt was effectively wiped out—certainly for those holding fixed interest rate loans.</p>
<h3 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h3>

<p>Hyperinflation is ended with drastic remedies, such as imposing the <a href="shock_therapy_(economics)" title="wikilink">shock therapy</a> of slashing government expenditures or altering the currency basis. One form this may take is <a class="uri" href="dollarization" title="wikilink">dollarization</a>, the use of a foreign currency (not necessarily the <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">U.S. dollar</a>) as a national unit of currency. An example was dollarization in Ecuador, initiated in September 2000 in response to a 75% loss of value of the <a href="Ecuadorian_sucre" title="wikilink">Ecuadorian sucre</a> in early 2000. But usually the "dollarization" takes place in spite of all efforts of the government to prevent it by exchange controls, heavy fines and penalties. The government has thus to try to engineer a successful currency reform stabilizing the value of the money. If it does not succeed with this reform the substitution of the inflating by stable money goes on. Thus it is not surprising that there exist at least seven historical cases in which the good (foreign) money did fully drive out the use of the inflating currency. In the end the government had to legalize the former, for otherwise its revenues would have fallen to zero.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>Hyperinflation has always been a traumatic experience for the area which suffers it, and the next policy regime almost always enacts policies to prevent its recurrence. Often this means making the central bank very aggressive about maintaining price stability, as was the case with the German <a class="uri" href="Bundesbank" title="wikilink">Bundesbank</a> or moving to some hard basis of currency such as a <a href="currency_board" title="wikilink">currency board</a>. Many governments have enacted extremely stiff <a href="wage_and_price_controls" title="wikilink">wage and price controls</a> in the wake of hyperinflation but this does not prevent further inflating of the money supply by its <a href="central_bank" title="wikilink">central bank</a>, and always leads to widespread shortages of consumer goods if the controls are rigidly enforced.</p>
<h3 id="currency">Currency</h3>

<p> In countries experiencing hyperinflation, the <a href="central_bank" title="wikilink">central bank</a> often prints money in larger and larger denominations as the smaller denomination notes become worthless. This can result in the production of some interesting <a href="banknote" title="wikilink">banknotes</a>, including those denominated in amounts of 1,000,000,000 or more.</p>
<ul>
<li>By late 1923, the <a href="Weimar_Republic" title="wikilink">Weimar Republic</a> of Germany was issuing two-trillion mark banknotes and postage stamps with a face value of fifty billion mark. The highest value banknote issued by the Weimar government's Reichsbank had a face value of 100 trillion mark (100,000,000,000,000; 100 million million).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> At the height of the inflation, one US dollar was worth 4 trillion German marks. One of the firms printing these notes submitted an invoice for the work to the Reichsbank for 32,776,899,763,734,490,417.05 (3.28 × 10<sup>19</sup>, or 33 <a class="uri" href="quintillion" title="wikilink">quintillion</a>) marks.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></li>
<li>The largest denomination banknote ever officially issued for circulation was in 1946 by the <a href="Hungarian_National_Bank" title="wikilink">Hungarian National Bank</a> for the amount of 100 quintillion <a class="uri" href="pengő" title="wikilink">pengő</a> (100,000,000,000,000,000,000, or 10<sup>20</sup>; 100 million million million) <a href="http://bankjegy.szabadsagharcos.org/xxcentury/p136.htm">image</a>. (There was even a banknote worth 10 times more, i.e. 10<sup>21</sup> (1 <a class="uri" href="sextillion" title="wikilink">sextillion</a>) pengő, printed, but not issued <a href="http://bankjegy.szabadsagharcos.org/xxcentury/p137.htm">image</a>.) The banknotes however did not depict the numbers, "hundred million b.-pengő" ("hundred million trillion pengő") and "one milliard b.-pengő" were spelled out instead. This makes the 100,000,000,000,000 <a href="Zimbabwean_dollar" title="wikilink">Zimbabwean dollar</a> banknotes the note with the greatest number of zeros shown.</li>
<li>The Post-World War II hyperinflation of Hungary held the record for the most extreme monthly inflation rate ever — 41,900,000,000,000,000% (4.19 × 10<sup>16</sup>% or 41.9 quadrillion percent) for July 1946, amounting to prices doubling every 15.3 hours. By comparison, recent figures (as of 14 November 2008) estimate Zimbabwe's annual inflation rate at 89.7 <a class="uri" href="sextillion" title="wikilink">sextillion</a> (10<sup>21</sup>) percent.,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> which corresponds to a monthly rate of 79.6 billion percent, and a doubling time of 24.7 hours. In figures, that is 89,700,000,000,000,000,000,000%.</li>
</ul>

<p>One way to avoid the use of large numbers is by declaring a new unit of currency (an example being, instead of 10,000,000,000 dollars, a bank might set 1 new dollar = 1,000,000,000 old dollars, so the new note would read "10 new dollars.") An example of this would be Turkey's revaluation of the <a class="uri" href="Lira" title="wikilink">Lira</a> on 1 January 2005, when the old <a href="Turkish_lira" title="wikilink">Turkish lira</a> (TRL) was converted to the <a href="New_Turkish_lira" title="wikilink">New Turkish lira</a> (TRY) at a rate of 1,000,000 old to 1 new Turkish Lira. While this does not lessen the actual value of a currency, it is called <a class="uri" href="redenomination" title="wikilink">redenomination</a> or <a class="uri" href="revaluation" title="wikilink">revaluation</a> and also happens over time in countries with standard inflation levels. During hyperinflation, currency inflation happens so quickly that bills reach large numbers before revaluation.</p>

<p>Some banknotes were stamped to indicate changes of denomination. This is because it would take too long to print new notes. By the time new notes were printed, they would be obsolete (that is, they would be of too low a denomination to be useful).</p>

<p>Metallic coins were rapid casualties of hyperinflation, as the scrap value of metal enormously exceeded the face value. Massive amounts of coinage were melted down, usually illicitly, and exported for hard currency.</p>

<p>Governments will often try to disguise the true rate of inflation through a variety of techniques. None of these actions address the root causes of inflation and if discovered, they tend to further undermine trust in the currency, causing further increases in inflation. <a href="Price_controls" title="wikilink">Price controls</a> will generally result in shortages and hoarding and extremely high demand for the controlled goods, causing disruptions of <a href="supply_chain" title="wikilink">supply chains</a>. Products available to consumers may diminish or disappear as businesses no longer find it sufficiently profitable (or may be operating at a loss) to continue producing and/or distributing such goods at the legal prices, further exacerbating the shortages.</p>

<p>There are also issues with computerized money-handling systems. In Zimbabwe, during the hyperinflation of the Zimbabwe dollar, many <a href="automated_teller_machines" title="wikilink">automated teller machines</a> and payment card machines struggled with <a href="arithmetic_overflow" title="wikilink">arithmetic overflow</a> errors as customers required many billions and trillions of dollars at one time.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1922, inflation in Austria reached 1426%, and from 1914 to January 1923, the consumer price index rose by a factor of 11836, with the highest banknote in denominations of 500,000 <a href="Austro-Hungarian_krone" title="wikilink">krones</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>Political ineptitude in Post WWI Austria comprised political expedience and Socialist benevolence. Thus, essentially all State enterprises ran at a loss and the number of State employees in Vienna, the capital of the post WWI republic was greater than that of the earlier monarchy, even though they served a population base nearly eight times smaller.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>Observing the Austrian response to developing hyperinflation, fueled by selfishness and political ineptitude, including the hoarding of food and the speculation in foreign currencies, Owen S. Phillpotts, the Commercial Secretary at the British Legation in Vienna wrote: “The Austrians are like men on a ship who cannot manage it, and are continually signalling for help. While waiting, however, most of them begin to cut rafts, each for himself, out of the sides and decks. The ship has not yet sunk despite the leaks so caused, and those who have acquired stores of wood in this way may use them to cook their food, while the more seamanlike look on cold and hungry. The population lack courage and energy as well as patriotism”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>As the first user of <a href="fiat_currency" title="wikilink">fiat currency</a>, China has had an early history of troubles caused by hyperinflation. The <a href="Yuan_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Yuan Dynasty</a> printed huge amounts of fiat paper money to fund their wars, and the resulting hyperinflation, coupled with other factors, led to its demise at the hands of a revolution. The Republic of China went through the worst inflation 1948–49. In 1947, the highest denomination was 50,000 <a href="Chinese_yuan#First_yuan,_1889–1948" title="wikilink">yuan</a>. By mid-1948, the highest denomination was 180,000,000 yuan. The 1948 currency reform replaced the yuan by the gold yuan at an exchange rate of 1 gold yuan = 3,000,000 yuan. In less than a year, the highest denomination was 10,000,000 gold yuan. In the final days of the civil war, the Silver Yuan was briefly introduced at the rate of 500,000,000 Gold Yuan. Meanwhile, the highest denomination issued by a regional bank was 6,000,000,000 yuan (issued by Xinjiang Provincial Bank in 1949). After the <a class="uri" href="renminbi" title="wikilink">renminbi</a> was instituted by the new communist government, hyperinflation ceased with a revaluation of 1:10,000 old <a href="First_series_of_the_renminbi" title="wikilink">Renminbi</a> in 1955. The overall impact of inflation was 1 Renminbi = 15,000,000,000,000,000,000 pre-1948 yuan.</p>

<p>  The <a href="Treaty_of_Trianon" title="wikilink">Treaty of Trianon</a> and political instability between 1919 and 1924 led to a major inflation of Hungary's currency. In 1921, in an attempt to arrest Post WWI inflation, the national assembly of Hungary passed the Hegedüs reforms, including a 20% levy on bank deposits. This action precipitated a mistrust of banks by the public, especially the peasants, and resulted in a reduction savings and the amount of currency in circulation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Unable to tax adequately, the government resorted to printing money and in 1923 inflation in Hungary reached 98% per month.</p>

 ZWN to each third dollar (ZWR).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> On 19 August 2008, official figures announced for June estimated the inflation over 11,250,000%.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Zimbabwe's annual inflation was 231,000,000% in July<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> (prices doubling every 17.3 days). By October 2008 Zimbawe was mired in hyperinflation with wages falling far behind inflation. In this dysfunctional economy hospitals and schools had chronic staffing problems, because many nurses and teachers could not afford bus fare to work. Most of the capital of Harare was without water because the authorities had stopped paying the bills to buy and transport the treatment chemicals. Desperate for foreign currency to keep the government functioning, Zimbabwe's central bank governor, Gideon Gono, sent runners into the streets with suitcases of Zimbabwean dollars to buy up American dollars and South African rand.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> For periods after July 2008, no official inflation statistics were released. Prof. Steve H. Hanke overcame the problem by estimating inflation rates after July 2008 and publishing the Hanke Hyperinflation Index for Zimbabwe.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Prof. Hanke's HHIZ measure indicated that the inflation peaked at an annual rate of 89.7 sextillion percent (89,700,000,000,000,000,000,000%) in mid-November 2008. The peak monthly rate was 79.6 billion percent, which is equivalent to a 98% daily rate, or around  percent yearly rate. At that rate, prices were doubling every 24.7 hours. Note that many of these figures should be considered mostly theoretic, since the hyperinflation did not proceed at that rate a whole year.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>

<p>At its November 2008 peak, Zimbabwe's rate of inflation approached, but failed to surpass, Hungary's July 1946 world record.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> On 2 February 2009, the dollar was redenominated for the fourth time at the ratio of

<h2 id="examples-of-high-inflation">Examples of high inflation</h2>

<p>Some countries experienced very high inflation, but did not reach hyperinflation, as defined as a <em>monthly</em> inflation rate of 50%.</p>
<h3 id="iraq">Iraq</h3>

<p>Between 1987 and 1995 the Iraqi Dinar went from an official value of 0.306 Dinars/USD (or $3.26 USD per dinar, though the black market rate is thought to have been substantially lower) to 3000 Dinars/USD due to government printing of 10s of trillions of dinars starting with a base of only 10s of billions. That equates to approximately 315% inflation per year averaged over that eight-year period.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="mexico">Mexico</h3>

<p>In spite of increased oil prices in the late 1970s (Mexico is a producer and exporter), Mexico defaulted on its external debt in 1982. As a result, the country suffered a severe case of capital flight and several years of hyperinflation and <a href="Mexican_peso" title="wikilink">peso</a> devaluation. On 1 January 1993, Mexico created a new currency, the <em>nuevo peso</em> ("new peso", or MXN), which chopped three zeros off the old peso, an inflation rate of 100,000% over the several years of the crisis. (One new peso was equal to 1,000 old MXP pesos).</p>
<h3 id="roman-egypt">Roman Egypt</h3>

<p>In Roman Egypt, where the best documentation on pricing has survived, the price of a measure of wheat was 200 drachmae in 276 AD, and increased to more than 2,000,000 drachmae in 334 AD, roughly 1,000,000% inflation in a span of 58 years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>

<p>Although the price increased by a factor of 10,000 over 58 years, the annual rate of inflation was only 17.2% compounded.</p>
<h3 id="romania">Romania</h3>

<p>Romania experienced hyperinflation in the 1990s. The highest denomination in 1990 was 100 <a href="Romanian_leu" title="wikilink">lei</a> and in 1998 was 100,000 lei. By 2000 it was 500,000 lei. In early 2005 it was 1,000,000 lei. In July 2005 the lei was replaced by the new leu at 10,000 old lei = 1 new leu. Inflation in 2005 was 9%.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> In July 2005 the highest denomination became 500 lei (= 5,000,000 old lei).</p>
<h3 id="soviet-union">Soviet Union</h3>

<p>Between 1921 and 1922, inflation in the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> reached 213%.</p>
<h3 id="united-states">United States</h3>

<p>During the <a href="American_Revolutionary_War" title="wikilink">Revolutionary War</a>, when the <a href="Continental_Congress" title="wikilink">Continental Congress</a> authorized the printing of paper currency called <a href="continental_(currency)" title="wikilink">continental currency</a>, the monthly inflation rate reached a peak of 47 percent in November 1779 (Bernholz 2003: 48). These notes depreciated rapidly, giving rise to the expression "not worth a continental." One cause of the inflation was counterfeiting by the British, who ran a press on <a href="HMS_Phoenix_(1759)" title="wikilink">HMS <em>Phoenix</em></a>, moored in New York Harbour. The counterfeits were advertised and sold almost for the price of the paper they were printed on.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>

<p>A second close encounter occurred during the <a href="U.S._Civil_War" title="wikilink">U.S. Civil War</a>, between January 1861 and April 1865, the <a href="Lerner_Commodity_Price_Index" title="wikilink">Lerner Commodity Price Index</a> of leading cities in the eastern Confederacy states increased from 100 to over 9,000.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn74" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> As the Civil War dragged on, the <a href="Confederate_States_of_America_dollar" title="wikilink">Confederate dollar</a> had less and less value, until it was almost worthless by the last few months of the war. Similarly, the Union government inflated its <a href="Greenback_(money)" title="wikilink">greenbacks</a>, with the monthly rate peaking at 40 percent in March 1864 (Bernholz 2003: 107).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn75" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="vietnam">Vietnam</h3>

<p>Vietnam went through a period of chaotic and hyperinflation in the late 1980s, with inflation peaking at 774% in 1988, after the country's "price-wage-currency" reform package led by Mr Tran Phuong, then Deputy Prime Minister, had failed bitterly.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn76" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Hyperinflation also characterizes the early stage of economic renovation, usually referred to as Doi Moi, in Vietnam.</p>

<p>Often, at <a href="redenomination" title="wikilink">redenominations</a>, three zeroes are cut from the bills. It can be read from the table that if the (annual) inflation is for example 100%, it takes 3.32 years to produce one more zero on the price tags, or 3 × 3.32 = 9.96 years to produce three zeroes. Thus can one expect a redenomination to take place about 9.96 years after the currency was introduced.</p>
