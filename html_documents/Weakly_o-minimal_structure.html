<h1>Weakly o-minimal structure</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In <a href="model_theory" title="wikilink">model theory</a>, a <strong>weakly o-minimal structure</strong> is a model theoretic <a href="Structure_(mathematical_logic)" title="wikilink"> structure</a> whose definable sets in the domain are just finite unions of convex sets.</p>

<p>A <a href="Total_order" title="wikilink">linearly ordered</a> structure, <em>M</em>, with language <em>L</em> including an ordering relation M.A.Dickmann, <em>Elimination of Quantifiers for Ordered Valuation Rings</em>, The Journal of symbolic Logic, Vol. 52, No. 1 (Mar., 1987), pp 116-128. <a href="http://www.jstor.org/view/00224812/di985230/98p04615/0">1</a></p>

<p>In an o-minimal structure <span class="LaTeX">$(M,<,...)$</span> the definable sets in <span class="LaTeX">$M$</span> are finite unions of points and intervals, where <em>interval</em> stands for a sets of the form <span class="LaTeX">$I=\{r\in M\,:\,a<r<b\}< math="">, for some ''a'' and ''b'' in <math>M \cup \{\pm \infty\}$</span>. For weakly o-minimal structures <span class="LaTeX">$(M,<,...)$</span> this is relaxed so that the definable sets in <em>M</em> are finite unions of convex definable sets. A set <span class="LaTeX">$C$</span> is convex if whenever <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are in <span class="LaTeX">$C$</span>, <em>a</em> M satisfies that <em>a</em> 0<a \,\wedge\,="" math="" s(a)</p>
<p>so that the set consists of all strictly positive real algebraic numbers that are less than <em>π</em>. The set is clearly convex, but cannot be written as a finite union of points and intervals whose endpoints are in <em>R</em>. To write it as an interval one would either have to include the endpoint <em>π</em>, which isn't in <em>R</em>, or one would require infinitely many intervals, such as the union</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\bigcup_{\alpha<\pi}(0,\alpha).$$</span></p>
<p>Since we have a definable set that isn't a finite union of points and intervals, this structure is not o-minimal. However, it is known that the structure is weakly o-minimal, and in fact the theory of this structure is weakly o-minimal.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
