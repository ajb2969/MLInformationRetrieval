<h1>Intersection form (4-manifold)</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, the <strong>intersection form</strong> of an oriented compact <a class="uri" href="4-manifold" title="wikilink">4-manifold</a> is a special symmetric <a href="bilinear_form" title="wikilink">bilinear form</a> on the 2nd cohomology group of the 4-manifold. It reflects much of the topology of the 4-manifolds, including information on the existence of a <a href="smooth_structure" title="wikilink">smooth structure</a>.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>The intersection form</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$Q_M\colon H^2(M;\mathbb{Z})\times H^2(M;\mathbb{Z})\to \mathbb{Z}$$</span></p>
<p>is given by</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$Q_M(a,b)=\langle a\smile b,[M]\rangle.$$</span></p>
<p>When the 4-manifold is also smooth, then in <a href="de_Rham_cohomology" title="wikilink">de Rham cohomology</a>, if <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are represented by 2-forms α and β, then the intersection form can be expressed by the integral</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$Q(a,b)= \int_M \alpha \wedge \beta$$</span></p>
<p>where <span class="LaTeX">$\wedge$</span> is the wedge product, see <a href="exterior_algebra" title="wikilink">exterior algebra</a>.</p>
<h2 id="poincaré-duality">Poincaré duality</h2>
<p><a href="Poincaré_duality" title="wikilink">Poincaré duality</a> allows a geometric definition of the intersection form. If the Poincaré duals of <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are represented by surfaces (or 2-cycles) <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> meeting transversely, then each intersection point has a multipicity +1 or −1 depending on the orientations, and <em>Q</em><sub><em>M</em></sub>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) is the sum of these multiplicities.</p>
<p>Thus the intersection form can also be thought of as a pairing on the 2nd homology group. Poincare duality also implies that the form is <a href="unimodular_form" title="wikilink">unimodular</a> (up to torsion).</p>
<h2 id="properties-and-applications">Properties and applications</h2>
<p>By <a href="Wu's_formula" title="wikilink">Wu's formula</a>, a <a href="spin_structure" title="wikilink">spin</a> 4-manifold must have even intersection form, i.e. <em>Q</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>x</em>) is even for every <em>x</em>. For a simply-connected 4-manifold (or more generally one with no 2-torsion residing in the first homology), the converse holds.</p>
<p>The signature of the intersection form is an important invariant. A 4-manifold bounds a 5-manifold if and only if it has zero signature. <a href="Van_der_Blij's_lemma" title="wikilink">Van der Blij's lemma</a> implies that a spin 4-manifold has signature a multiple of eight. In fact, <a href="Rokhlin's_theorem" title="wikilink">Rokhlin's theorem</a> implies that a smooth compact spin 4-manifold has signature a multiple of 16.</p>
<p><a href="Michael_Freedman" title="wikilink">Michael Freedman</a> used the intersection form to classify simply-connected topological 4-manifolds. Given any unimodular symmetric bilinear form over the integers, <em>Q</em>, there is a simply-connected closed 4-manifold <em>M</em> with intersection form <em>Q</em>. If <em>Q</em> is even, there is only one such manifold. If <em>Q</em> is odd, there are two, with at least one (possibly both) having no smooth structure. Thus two simply-connected closed <em>smooth</em> 4-manifolds with the same intersection form are homeomorphic. In the odd case, the two manifolds are distinguished by their <a href="Kirby–Siebenmann_invariant" title="wikilink">Kirby–Siebenmann invariant</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Donaldson's_theorem" title="wikilink">Donaldson's theorem</a> states a <em>smooth</em> simply-connected 4-manifold with positive definite intersection form has the diagonal (scalar 1) intersection form. So Freedman's classification implies there are many non-smoothable 4-manifolds, for example the <a href="E8_manifold" title="wikilink">E8 manifold</a>.</p>
<h2 id="non-orientable-manifolds">Non-orientable manifolds</h2>
<p>Just as there is a version of Poincare duality for Z/2Z coefficients, there is also a version of the intersection form with Z/2Z coefficients, taking values in Z/2Z rather than in Z. In this way non-orientable manifolds get an intersection form as well. Of course one does not see any of this in de Rham cohomology.</p>
