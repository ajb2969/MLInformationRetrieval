<h1>Assured Clear Distance Ahead</h1>
<hr>The '''Assured Clear Distance Ahead''' ('''ACDA''') is the distance ahead of a [[vehicle]] or [[Watercraft|craft]] which can be seen to be clear of hazards by the driver, within which they should be able to bring the vehicle to a halt.<ref name="USLegal">{{cite web |url=http://boats.uslegal.com/liability-of-motorboat-owners-and-operators-for-injury-or-damage |title=Liability of Motorboat Owners and Operators for Injury or Damage |publisher=US Legal, Inc. |quote=a person should operate a motor boat at a rate of speed less than that which will permit him to bring it to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead.}}</ref> It is one of the most fundamental principles governing [[ordinary care]] and the [[duty of care]] and is frequently used to determine if a driver is in proper <p>control and is a nearly universally implicit consideration in vehicular accident liability.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>This distance is typically both determined and constrained by the proximate edge of clear visibility, but it may be attenuated to a margin of which beyond hazards may reasonably be expected to spontaneously appear. It is a spatial component to the common law <a href="speed_limit#Basic_rule:_reasonable_speed" title="wikilink">basic speed rule</a>. The <a href="two-second_rule" title="wikilink">two-second rule</a> may be the limiting factor governing the ACDA, when the speed of forward traffic is what limits the basic safe speed, and a primary hazard of collision could result from following any closer.</p>
<h2 id="acda-as-common-law-rule-or-statute">ACDA as Common Law Rule or Statute</h2>
<p>"At <a href="common_law" title="wikilink">common law</a> a motorist is required to regulate his speed so that he can stop within the range of his vision. In numerous jurisdictions, this rule has been incorporated in <a class="uri" href="statutes" title="wikilink">statutes</a> which typically require that no person shall drive any motor vehicle in and upon any public road or highway at a greater speed than will permit him to bring it to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> <a href="Case_law" title="wikilink">Decisional law</a> usually settles the circumstances by which a portion of the roadway is assuredly clear without it being mentioned in statute.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> California is a state where the judiciary has established the state's ACDA law.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Most state issued driver handbooks either instruct or mention the ACDA rule as required care or safe practice.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Many states have further passed <a class="uri" href="statutes" title="wikilink">statutes</a> which require their courts to more inflexibly weigh the ACDA in their determination of reasonable speed or behavior. Such statutes do so in part by designating ACDA violations as a citable driving offense, thus burdening an offending driver to rebut a <a href="Negligence_per_se" title="wikilink">presumption of negligence</a>. States with such explicit ACDA <a href="standard_of_care" title="wikilink">standard of care</a> provisions include: Iowa,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Michigan,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Ohio,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Oklahoma,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and Pennsylvania.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> States which apply the principle by statute to watercraft on navigable waterways include: Montana,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Florida,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Louisiana,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> and West Virginia. Explicit ACDA statutes, especially those of which create a citable driving offense, are aimed at preventing harm that could result from potentially negligent behavior—whereas the slightly more obscure common law ACDA doctrine is most easily invoked to remedy actual damages that have already occurred as a result of such negligence. Explicit and implicit ACDA rules govern millions of North American drivers.</p>

<h4 id="forward-line-of-sight-distance">forward "line-of-sight" distance</h4>
<p>The range of visibility of which is the de facto ACDA, is usually that distance before which an ordinary person can see small hazards—such as a <a href="traffic_cone" title="wikilink">traffic cone</a> or <a class="uri" href="buoy" title="wikilink">buoy</a>—with <a href="20/20_vision" title="wikilink">20/20 vision</a>. This distance may be attenuated by specific conditions such as <a href="Optical_depth" title="wikilink">atmospheric opacity</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> <a href="Glare_(vision)" title="wikilink">blinding glare</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> darkness,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> <a href="Geometric_design_of_roads" title="wikilink">road design</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> and adjacent environmental hazards including civil and recreational activities,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> deer, livestock, crossing traffic,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and <a href="parking" title="wikilink">parked cars</a>. The ACDA may also be somewhat attenuated on roads with lower <a href="functional_classification" title="wikilink">functional classification</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> This is because the <a class="uri" href="probability" title="wikilink">probability</a> of spontaneous traffic increases proportionally to the density of road access points, and this density reduces the distance a person exercising <a href="ordinary_care" title="wikilink">ordinary care</a> can be assured that a road will be clear; such reduction in the ACDA is readily apparent from the conditions, even when a specific access point or the traffic thereon is not.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Furthermore, even though a through-driver may typically presume all traffic will stay assuredly clear when required by law, such driver may not take such presumption when circumstances provide actual knowledge under ordinary care that such traffic cannot obey the law.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="intersections">intersections</h5>
<p>Where there are cross roads or side roads with view obstructions, the assured clear distance terminates at the closest path of potential users of the roadway until there is such a view which assures the intersection will remain clear. In such situations, approach speed must be reduced in preparation for entering or crossing a road or intersection or the unmarked pedestrian crosswalks<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> and bike paths<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> they create because of potential hazards.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>When approaching an un-signalized intersection controlled by a <a href="stop_sign" title="wikilink">stop sign</a>, the assured clear distance ahead is:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$ACDA_{si}=V ( \sqrt{\frac{2d_i}{a_i}} + t_{pc} )$$</span></p>
<p>Normal acceleration "a<sub>i</sub>" for a passenger vehicle from a stop up to 20 mph is about 0.15g, with more than 0.3g being difficult to exceed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The distance "d<sub>i</sub>" is the sum of the measured <a href="Stop_and_yield_lines" title="wikilink">limit line</a> setback distance—which is typically regulated by a <a href="Manual_on_Uniform_Traffic_Control_Devices" title="wikilink">Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices</a>, at often between 4 and 30 feet in the United States<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a>—and the <a class="uri" href="crosswalk" title="wikilink">crosswalk</a>, <a href="Parallel_parking" title="wikilink">parking lane</a>, and <a href="road_shoulder" title="wikilink">road shoulder</a> width. A vehicle accelerating from a stop travels this distance in time "t<sub>i</sub>=√(2d<sub>i</sub>/a<sub>i</sub>)" while through traffic travels a distance equal to their speed multiplied by that time. The time t<sub>pc</sub>, for the stopped motorist, is the sum of perception time and the time required to actuate an automatic transmission or shift to first gear which is usually between 1/2 to one second.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="acda-as-a-function-of-horizontal-sight-distance">ACDA as a function of horizontal sight distance</h4>
<p>Horizontal clearance is measured from the edge of the traveled way to the bottom of the nearest object, tree trunk or shrub foliage mass face, plant setback, or mature growth.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Horizontal sight distance is not to be confused with the clear recovery zone which provides hazardous vegetation set-back to allow errant vehicles to regain control, and is exclusive to a mowed and limbed-up forest which can allow adequate sight distance, but unsafe recovery.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The height and lateral distance of plants restrict the horizontal sight distance, at times obscuring wildlife which may be spooked by an approaching vehicle and run across the road to escape with their <a class="uri" href="herd" title="wikilink">herd</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> This principle also applies to approaching vehicles and pedestrians at uncontrolled intersections and to a lesser degree by un-signalized intersections controlled by a <a href="yield_sign" title="wikilink">yield sign</a>. Horizontal sight distance "d<sub>hsd</sub>" affects the ACDA because the time "t<sub>i</sub>=d<sub>hsd</sub>/V<sub>i</sub>" it takes for an intercepting object, animal, pedestrian, or vehicle with speed "V<sub>i</sub>" to transverse this distance after emerging from the proximate edge of lateral visibility affords a vehicle with speed "V" a clear distance of "Vt<sub>i</sub>." Thus, the assured clear intercept distance "ACDA<sub>si</sub>" is:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$ACDA_{si}=\frac{V d_{hsd}}{V_i}$$</span></p>
<p>The faster one drives, the farther down-road an interceptor must be in order to be able to transverse the horizontal sight distance in time to collide, however this says nothing of whether the vehicle can stop by the end of this type of assured clear distance. Equating this distance to the total stopping distance and solving for speed yields one's maximum <a href="Assured_Clear_Distance_Ahead#Relation_to_the_basic_speed_rule" title="wikilink">safe speed</a> as purely dictated by the horizontal sight distance.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-following-distance">Dynamic "following" distance</h3>
<p>The ACDA may also be dynamic as to the moving distance past which a motorist can be assured be to able to stay clear of a foreseeable dynamic hazard—such as to maintain a distance as to be able to safely swerve around a bicyclist should he succumb to a fall—without requiring a full stop beforehand, if doing so could be exercised with <a href="due_care" title="wikilink">due care</a> towards surrounding traffic. Quantitatively this distance is a function of the appropriate time gap and the operating speed: d<sub>ACDA</sub>=t<sub>gap</sub>*v. The assured clear distance ahead rule, rather than being subject to exceptions, is not really intended to apply beyond situations in which a vigilant ordinarily prudent person could or should anticipate.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> A common way to violate the dynamic ACDA is by <a class="uri" href="tailgating" title="wikilink">tailgating</a>.</p>
<h3 id="measurement">Measurement</h3>
<p>The most accurate way to determine the ACDA is to directly measure it. Whereas this is impractical, <a href="Geometric_design_of_roads#Profile" title="wikilink">sight distance formulas</a> can be used with less direct measurements as rough baseline estimates. The <a class="uri" href="empirical" title="wikilink">empirical</a> assured clear distance ahead calculated with <a href="computer_vision" title="wikilink">computer vision</a>, <a href="range_finding" title="wikilink">range finding</a>, <a href="traction_control" title="wikilink">traction control</a>, and <a href="Geographic_information_system" title="wikilink">GIS</a>, such as by properly <a href="Computer_programming" title="wikilink">programming</a> computer hardware used in <a href="autonomous_cars" title="wikilink">autonomous cars</a>, can be recorded to later produce or color baseline ACDA and safe speed maps for accident investigation, traffic engineering, and show disparities between safe speed and 85th percentile "operating" speed. Self-driving cars may have a higher safe speed than human driven vehicles for a given ACDA where computer perception-reaction times are nearly instantaneous.</p>
<h3 id="discretion">Discretion</h3>
<p>The Assured Clear Distance Ahead can be subjective to the baseline estimate of a <a href="ordinary_care" title="wikilink">reasonable person</a> or be predetermined by law. For example, whether one should have reasonably foreseen that a road was not assuredly clear past 75–100 meters because of tractors or livestock which commonly emerge from encroaching blinding vegetation is on occasion dependent on societal experience within the locale. In certain urban environments, a straight, traffic-less, through-street may not necessarily be assuredly clear past the entrance of the nearest <a href="Geometric_design_of_roads#Effects_of_insufficient_sight_distance" title="wikilink">visually obstructed intersection</a> as law.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Within the assured clear distance ahead, there is certainty that travel will be free from obstruction which is exclusive of a failure to appreciate a hazard. Collisions generally only occur within one's assured clear distance ahead which are "unavoidable" to them such that they have zero comparative negligence including <a href="Act_of_God" title="wikilink">legal acts of god</a> and abrupt unforeseeably wanton negligence by another party. Hazards which penetrate one's proximate edge of clear visibility and compromise their ACDA generally require evasive action.</p>
<p>Drivers need not and are not required to precisely determine the maximum safe speed from real-time mathematical calculations of sight distances and stopping distances for their particular vehicle. Motor vehicle operators of average intelligence constantly utilize their <a href="Eye–hand_coordination" title="wikilink">kinesthetic memory</a> in all sorts of driving tasks including every time they break to a full stop at a stop line in a panoply of conditions. Like throwing a softball, one does not have to calculate a trajectory or firing solution in order to hit a target with repeated accuracy. During the earliest stages of learning how to drive, one develops a memory of when to start breaking (how long it takes) from various speeds in order to stop at the limit line. While there may be a degree of variance of such skill in drivers, they generally do not have the discretion in engaging in a behavior such as driving a speed above which no reasonable minds might differ as to whether it is unsafe or that one could come to a stop within the full distance ahead.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="relation-to-the-basic-speed-rule">Relation to the basic speed rule</h2>
<p>The ACDA distances are a principal component to be evaluated in the determination of the maximum safe speed (V<sub>BSL</sub>) under the <a href="Speed_limit#Reasonable_speed" title="wikilink">basic speed law</a>, without which the maximum safe speed cannot be determined. The relation of the ACDA to the basic speed rule for land based vehicles may be objectively quantified as follows:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$V_{BSL}= \begin{cases}
 \sqrt{(\mu +e)^2 g^2 t_{prt}^2+ 2 (\mu + e) g d_{ACDA_s} } - (\mu+e) g t_{prt}, & \mbox{if } V_{ACDA_s} \le V_{ACDA_{si1}} \mbox{ or } V_{ACDA_{si2}} \mbox{ or } V_{ACDA_d} \mbox{ or } V_{cs}  \mbox{ or } V_{cl}\\

The value of the variable "e" is the [[sine]] of the [[angle]] of inclination of the road's [[slope]]. For a level road this value is zero, and for [[Small-angle approximation|small angles]] it approximates the road's percent [[Grade (slope)|grade]] divided by one hundred.

e=sin(\theta) \approx  \theta \approx tan(\theta) = \frac{%grade}{100}$$</span></p>
<p>The maximum velocity permitted by the Assured Clear Distance Ahead is controlling of safe speed (V<sub>BSL</sub>) for only the top and two cases. Safe speed may be greater or less than the actual <a href="speed_limit" title="wikilink">legal speed limit</a> depending upon the conditions along the road.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> <mtpl></mtpl></p>
<p>See reference <a href="Assured_Clear_Distance_Ahead#Derivations" title="wikilink">V<sub>BSL</sub> derivations</a> for basic physics explanation.</p>
<h3 id="acda-forward-line-of-sight">ACDA: forward line-of-sight</h3>
<p>For the top case, the maximum speed is governed by the assured clear "line-of-sight", as when the "following distance" aft of forward traffic and "steering control" are both adequate. Common examples include when there is no vehicle to be viewed, or when there is a haze or fog that would prevent visualizing a close vehicle in front. This maximum velocity is denoted by the case variable <span class="LaTeX">$V_{ACDA_s}$</span>, the <a href="coefficient_of_friction" title="wikilink">friction coefficient</a> is symbolized by <span class="LaTeX">$\mu$</span>—and itself a function of the <a href="Treadwear_rating" title="wikilink">tire type</a> and <a href="road_slipperiness" title="wikilink">road conditions</a>, the distance <span class="LaTeX">$d_{ACDA_s}$</span> is the static ACDA, the constant <span class="LaTeX">$g$</span> is the <a href="Gravity_of_Earth" title="wikilink">acceleration of gravity</a>, and interval <span class="LaTeX">$t_{prt}$</span> is the <a href="Mental_chronometry" title="wikilink">perception-reaction time</a>—usually between 1.0 and 2.5 seconds.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="acda-horizontal-line-of-sight">ACDA: horizontal line-of-sight</h3>
<p>The second case describes the relationship of horizontal sight distance on safe speed. It is the maximum speed at which a vehicle can come to a full stop before an object, with speed V<sub>i</sub>, can intercept after having emerged and traveled across the horizontal sight distance "d<sub>hsd</sub>." Urban and residential areas have horizontal sight distance that tends to be closely obstructed by parked cars, utility poles, street furnishing, fencing, signage, and landscaping, but have slower intercepting speeds of children, pedestrians, backing cars, and domestic animals. These interceptors combined with dense usage results in collisions that are more probable and much more likely to inflict harm to an outside human life. In rural areas, swift-moving spooked wildlife such as <a class="uri" href="deer" title="wikilink">deer</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> <a class="uri" href="elk" title="wikilink">elk</a>, <a href="Moose#Vehicle_collisions" title="wikilink">moose</a>, and <a href="pronghorn" title="wikilink">antelope</a> are more likely to intercept a roadway at over 30 mph (48 kph). Wildlife will frequently transit across a road before a full stop is necessary, however collisions with large <a href="Game_(hunting)" title="wikilink">game</a> are foreseeably lethal, and a driver generally has a duty not to harm his or her passengers. The foreseeable intercept speed or defectively designed horizontal sight distance may vary "reasonably" with <a href="judicial_discretion" title="wikilink">judicial discretion</a>.</p>
<h3 id="acda-intersectional-setback">ACDA: intersectional setback</h3>
<p>This third case regards safe speed around un-signalized intersections where a driver on an uncontrolled though street has a duty to slow down in crossing an intersection and permit <a href="stop_sign" title="wikilink">controlled</a> drivers to be able pass through the intersection without danger of collision.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> The driver on the through street must anticipate and hence not approach at an unsafe speed which would prevent another driver from being able to enter while traffic was some distance away, or would be unsafe to a driver who has already established control of the intersection under a prudent acceleration a<sub>i</sub>, from a stop at a limit line a distance d<sub>sl</sub> away.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="acda-following-distance">ACDA: following distance</h3>
<p>The pedantic fourth case applies when the dynamic ACDA "following distance" (d<sub>ACDA<sub>d</sub></sub>) is less than the static ACDA "line-of-sight" distance (d<sub>ACDA<sub>s</sub></sub>). A classic instance of this occurs when, from a visibility perspective, it would be safe to drive much faster were it not for a slower-moving vehicle ahead. As such, the dynamic ACDA is governing the basic speed rule, because in maintaining this distance, one cannot drive at a faster speed than that matching the forward vehicle. The "time gap" t<sub>g</sub> or "time cushion" is the time required to travel the dynamic ACDA or "following distance" at the <a href="operating_speed" title="wikilink">operating speed</a>. Circumstances depending, this cushion might be manifested as a <a href="two-second_rule" title="wikilink">two-second rule</a> or three-second rule.</p>
<h3 id="critical-speed">critical speed</h3>
<p>In the fifth case, critical speed V<sub>cs</sub> applies when road curvature is the factor limiting safe speed. A vehicle which exceeds this speed will <a href="slip_angle" title="wikilink">slide</a> out of its lane. Critical speed is a function of curve <a class="uri" href="radius" title="wikilink">radius</a> "r," <a class="uri" href="superelevation" title="wikilink">superelevation</a> or banking "e," and friction coefficient "μ;"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> the constant "g" again is the acceleration of gravity. However, most motorists will not tolerate a lateral acceleration exceeding 0.3g (μ=0.3) above which many will panic.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Hence, critical speed may not resemble loss of control speed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Attenuated "side" friction coefficients are often used for computing critical speed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The formula is frequently approximated without the denominator for low angle banking which may be suitable for nearly all situations except the tightest radius of highway onramps.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="surface-control">surface control</h3>
<p>The bottom case is invoked when the maximum velocity for surface control V<sub>cl</sub> is otherwise reached. Steering control is independent from any concept of clear distance ahead. If a vehicle cannot be controlled so as to safely remain within its lane above a certain speed and circumstance, then it is irrelevant how assuredly clear the distance is ahead. Using the example of the previous case, the safe speed on a curve may be such that a driver experiences a lateral acceleration of less than 0.3g despite that the vehicle may not slide until it experiences 0.8g. <a href="Speed_wobble" title="wikilink">Speed wobble</a>, <a href="aquaplaning" title="wikilink">hydroplaning</a>, <a href="roll_center" title="wikilink">roll center</a>, <a class="uri" href="fishtailing" title="wikilink">fishtailing</a>, <a href="jackknifing" title="wikilink">jackknife</a> tendencies, <a class="uri" href="potholes" title="wikilink">potholes</a>, <a class="uri" href="washboarding" title="wikilink">washboarding</a>, and <a href="frost_heaving" title="wikilink">frost heaving</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> are other factors limiting V<sub>cl</sub>.</p>
<h3 id="safe-speed">Safe Speed</h3>

<h2 id="assurance-beyond-proximate-edge-of-clear-visibility-as-transference-of-liability">"Assurance" Beyond Proximate Edge of Clear Visibility as Transference of Liability</h2>
<p>A general principle in <a class="uri" href="liability" title="wikilink">liability</a> doctrine is than an accident which would not have occurred except for the action or inaction of some person or entity contrary to a <a href="legal_duty" title="wikilink">duty</a> such as the exercise of <a href="ordinary_care" title="wikilink">proper care</a> was the result of <a class="uri" href="negligence" title="wikilink">negligence</a>. Jurisdictional exceptions permitting one to legally take "assurance" that the distance will be clear beyond the proximate edge of clear visibility and choose such a speed accordingly, transfers liability from that driver for his or her "blind" actions. This duty to assure clear distance ahead is most easily transferred to the government and its road engineers and maintainers. As it is generally <a href="Proximate_cause#Foreseeability" title="wikilink">foreseeable</a> that, chance permits, at some point there will be an obstruction beyond some driver's line of sight, such an entitlement challenges established negligence doctrines in addition to posing difficult policy and engineering challenges.</p>
<p>To be able to guarantee this "assurance," a road must be designed and maintained such that there is not a chance of obstruction in one's lane beyond the proximate edge of clear visibility. A road's vertical <a href="Geometric_design_of_roads#Profile" title="wikilink">profile</a> must be assured to have such a curvature as not to hide hazards close behind its crests. <a class="uri" href="Discretion" title="wikilink">Discretion</a> for drivers and pedestrians to enter onto a potentially occupied lane from a side street must be assuredly eliminated such as with fences, merge lanes, or signalized access. There must also be an assurance of no opportunity for animals and debris to enter from side lots, and that there are continuous multi-hourly maintenance <a href="highway_patrol" title="wikilink">patrols</a> performed. Furthermore, such road sections must be distinguished from other roads so that the driver could clearly and immediately know when he or she may or may not take such extended "assurance." Few roads might meet these requirements except some of the highest functional classification <a class="uri" href="freeways" title="wikilink">freeways</a> and <a class="uri" href="autobahns" title="wikilink">autobahns</a>.</p>
<p>Even if such criteria are met, the law must also exempt driver liability for maintaining clear distance ahead. In most democracies, such liability for failures of the distance to remain clear beyond line of sight would ultimately be transferred to its taxpayers. This only generally occurs when governments have been tasked by constituents or their courts to take the responsibly to design and maintain roadways that "assure" the distance will be clear beyond the proximate edge of clear visibility. Pressures to make such changes may arise from cultural <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Professionalism/Diane_Vaughan_and_the_normalization_of_deviance">normalization of deviance</a> and unnecessary risk, misunderstanding the purpose of the road <a href="functional_classification" title="wikilink">functional classification</a> system, underestimation of increased risk, and reclamation of commute time.</p>
<p>One of the greatest difficulties created by such an extension of the ACDA is the frequency at which roads reduce their <a href="functional_classification" title="wikilink">functional classification</a> unbeknownst to drivers who continue unaware they have lost this extended "assurance" or don't understand the difference. Such nuance in applicable jurisdictions is a prolific source of accidents.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn74" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> In the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, there is no explicit road marking promising clear distance beyond line of sight in the <a href="Manual_on_Uniform_Traffic_Control_Devices" title="wikilink">Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices</a>, although there are signs communicating "<a href="http://www.trafficsigns.com/w14-4-limited-sight-distance-sign.html">limited sight distance</a>," "<a href="http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009r1r2/part2/part2c.htm#section2C18">hill blocks view</a>," "<a href="http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009r1r2/part2/part2c.htm#section2C46">crossroad ahead</a>," and "<a href="http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009r1r2/part2/part2c.htm#section2C24">freeway ends</a>."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn75" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> A partial solution to this challenge is to remove driver discretion in determining whether the ACDA is extended beyond line of sight, by explicitly designating this law change to certain marked high functional classification roadways having meet strict engineering criteria.</p>
