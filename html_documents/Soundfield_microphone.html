<h1>Soundfield microphone</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>Soundfield microphone</strong> is an audio <a class="uri" href="microphone" title="wikilink">microphone</a> composed of four closely spaced <a href="Microphone#Microphone_polar_patterns" title="wikilink">subcardioid</a> or <a href="Microphone#Microphone_polar_patterns" title="wikilink">cardioid</a> (unidirectional) microphone capsules arranged in a <a class="uri" href="tetrahedron" title="wikilink">tetrahedron</a>. It was invented by <a href="Michael_Gerzon" title="wikilink">Michael Gerzon</a> and Peter Craven, and is a part of, but not exclusive to, <a class="uri" href="Ambisonics" title="wikilink">Ambisonics</a>, a <a href="surround_sound" title="wikilink">surround sound</a> technology. It can function as a mono, stereo or surround sound microphone, optionally including height information.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The soundfield mic was invented by <a href="Michael_Gerzon" title="wikilink">Michael Gerzon</a> and Peter Craven. Their theoretical design was developed into a practical microphone system by Calrec Audio Limited, who launched the first soundfield mic in 1978.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1993, the soundfield mic part of Calrec was separated out as the company SoundField Limited, who further developed the range of products.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Since the original patents relating to the soundfield mic expired, other companies have started to manufacture soundfield mics.</p>
<h2 id="signals">Signals</h2>

<p>A Soundfield microphone kit, consisting of the microphone and a signal processor, produces two distinct sets of audio signals called <em>A-Format</em> and <em>B-Format</em>. The sound processor may be either dedicated hardware, or a computer running software. The software processing may be done in real-time during the recording, or later offline.</p>
<h3 id="a-format">A-Format</h3>

<p> The first set, the A-Format, is produced by the Soundfield microphone itself and consists of the four signals from the microphone capsules. These four signals are not intended to be used without further processing. The A-Format is normally transformed into the second set of audio signals, the B-Format. This process is described in the two sources listed under <a href="#Further_reading" title="wikilink">Further reading</a>. Depending on the microphone model, this transformation can be performed in either hardware or software.</p>
<h3 id="b-format">B-Format</h3>

<p>The B-Format is the standard audio format produced by a soundfield kit. It consists of the following four signals:</p>
<ul>
<li>W - a pressure signal corresponding to the output from an omnidirectional microphone</li>
<li>X - the front-to-back directional information, a forward-pointing velocity or "figure-of-eight" microphone</li>
<li>Y - the side-to-side directional information, a leftward-pointing "figure-of-eight" microphone</li>
<li>Z - the up-to-down directional information, an upward-pointing "figure-of-eight" microphone</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the constant (W) and linear (X, Y, Z) terms in the <a href="multipole_expansion" title="wikilink">multipole expansion</a> of a function on the sphere – in effect, it approximates the <a href="wave_field_synthesis" title="wikilink">wave field</a> on a sphere around the microphone.</p>

<p>It is possible to recreate the three-dimensional soundfield, however the soundfield microphone particularly shows its versatility in a stereo or mono application. For example, a forward-facing cardioid is produced by

. By combining the signals in various proportions, it is possible to derive any number of first-order microphones, pointing in any direction, before and after recording. For instance, provided the W, X, Y and Z signals are recorded separately, it is possible to pinpoint the microphone to a certain response from the audience even after recording. Examples of software that perform these calculations are <a href="http://vvaudio.com/vvmic/">Visual Virtual Microphone</a>, SoundField's <a href="http://www.soundfield.com/products/s_zone.php">Surround Zone</a> and Ambisonic Studio's <a href="http://www.radio.uqam.ca/ambisonic/b2x.html">B2X decoders</a> plug-ins.</p>

<p>In other words, the B-format recording can be decoded to model any number of microphones pointing in arbitrary directions: each microphone's pattern can be selected to be omnidirectional, cardioid, hypercardioid, figure-of-eight, or anything in between. This can be done live or in post-production (after the recording is made).</p>

<p>The playback configuration is equally flexible. Again in post-production, the B-format recording can be decoded to any number of speakers arranged in both the horizontal and vertical planes.</p>

<p>Note however that this information only allows the direction of sound at the microphone to be reproduced – microphone responses pointing in any <em>direction</em> can be synthesized, but it does not allow the reconstruction of what a microphone at a different <em>point in space</em> would record. To do that requires reconstructing the wave field in more detail (as in <a href="wave_field_synthesis" title="wikilink">wave field synthesis</a>).</p>
