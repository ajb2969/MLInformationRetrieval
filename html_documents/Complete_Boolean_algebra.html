<h1>Complete Boolean algebra</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, a <strong>complete Boolean algebra</strong> is a <a href="Boolean_algebra_(structure)" title="wikilink">Boolean algebra</a> in which every <a class="uri" href="subset" title="wikilink">subset</a> has a <a class="uri" href="supremum" title="wikilink">supremum</a> (least upper bound). Complete Boolean algebras are used to construct <a href="Boolean-valued_model" title="wikilink">Boolean-valued models</a> of set theory in the theory of <a href="forcing_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">forcing</a>. Every Boolean algebra <em>A</em> has an essentially unique completion, which is a complete Boolean algebra containing <em>A</em> such that every element is the supremum of some subset of <em>A</em>. As a <a href="partially_ordered_set" title="wikilink">partially ordered set</a>, this completion of <em>A</em> is the <a href="Dedekind–MacNeille_completion" title="wikilink">Dedekind–MacNeille completion</a>.</p>

<p>More generally, if κ is a cardinal then a Boolean algebra is called <strong>κ-complete</strong> if every subset of cardinality less than κ has a supremum.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<ul>
<li>Every <a href="Finite_set" title="wikilink">finite</a> Boolean algebra is complete.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="algebra_of_sets" title="wikilink">algebra of subsets</a> of a given set is a complete Boolean algebra.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="regular_open_set" title="wikilink">regular open sets</a> of any <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topological space</a> form a complete Boolean algebra. This example is of particular importance because every forcing <a class="uri" href="poset" title="wikilink">poset</a> can be considered as a topological space (a <a href="base_(topology)" title="wikilink">base</a> for the topology consisting of sets that are the set of all elements less than or equal to a given element). The corresponding regular open algebra can be used to form <a href="Boolean-valued_model" title="wikilink">Boolean-valued models</a> which are then equivalent to <a href="generic_extension" title="wikilink">generic extensions</a> by the given forcing poset.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The algebra of all measurable subsets of a σ-finite measure space, modulo null sets, is a complete Boolean algebra. When the measure space is the unit interval with the σ-algebra of Lebesgue measurable sets, the Boolean algebra is called the <a href="random_algebra" title="wikilink">random algebra</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The algebra of all measurable subsets of a measure space is a ℵ<sub>1</sub>-complete Boolean algebra, but is not usually complete.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The algebra of all subsets of an infinite set that are finite or have finite complement is a Boolean algebra but is not complete.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Boolean algebra of all <a href="Baire_set" title="wikilink">Baire sets</a> modulo <a href="meager_set" title="wikilink">meager sets</a> in a topological space with a countable base is complete; when the topological space is the real numbers the algebra is sometimes called the <a href="Cantor_algebra" title="wikilink">Cantor algebra</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Another example of a Boolean algebra that is not complete is the Boolean algebra P(ω) of all sets of <a href="natural_number" title="wikilink">natural numbers</a>, quotiented out by the ideal <em>Fin</em> of finite subsets. The resulting object, denoted P(ω)/Fin, consists of all <a href="equivalence_class" title="wikilink">equivalence classes</a> of sets of naturals, where the relevant <a href="equivalence_relation" title="wikilink">equivalence relation</a> is that two sets of naturals are equivalent if their <a href="symmetric_difference" title="wikilink">symmetric difference</a> is finite. The Boolean operations are defined analogously, for example, if <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are two equivalence classes in P(ω)/Fin, we define

, where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are some (any) elements of <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> respectively.</li>

<dl>
<dd>Now let a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>,... be pairwise disjoint infinite sets of naturals, and let <em>A</em><sub>0</sub>, <em>A</em><sub>1</sub>,... be their corresponding equivalence classes in P(ω)/Fin . Then given any upper bound <em>X</em> of <em>A</em><sub>0</sub>, <em>A</em><sub>1</sub>,... in P(ω)/Fin, we can find a <em>lesser</em> upper bound, by removing from a representative for <em>X</em> one element of each <em>a</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>. Therefore the <em>A</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> have no supremum.

<li>A Boolean algebra is complete if and only if its <a href="Stone_space" title="wikilink">Stone space</a> of prime ideals is <a href="extremally_disconnected" title="wikilink">extremally disconnected</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>if <em>A</em> is a subalgebra of a Boolean algebra <em>B</em>, then any homomorphism from <em>A</em> to a complete Boolean algebra <em>C</em> can be extended to a morphism from <em>B</em> to <em>C</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every subset of a complete Boolean algebra has a supremum, by definition; it follows that every subset also has an <a class="uri" href="infimum" title="wikilink">infimum</a> (greatest lower bound).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For a complete boolean algebra both infinite distributive laws hold.</li>
<li>For a complete boolean algebra <a href="infinite_de-Morgan's_laws" title="wikilink">infinite de-Morgan's laws</a> hold.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-completion-of-a-boolean-algebra">The completion of a Boolean algebra</h2>

<p>The completion of a Boolean algebra can be defined in several equivalent ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The completion of <em>A</em> is (up to isomorphism) the unique complete Boolean algebra <em>B</em> containing <em>A</em> such that <em>A</em> is dense in <em>B</em>; this means that for every nonzero element of <em>B</em> there is a smaller non-zero element of <em>A</em>.</li>
<li>The completion of <em>A</em> is (up to isomorphism) the unique complete Boolean algebra <em>B</em> containing <em>A</em> such that every element of <em>B</em> is the supremum of some subset of <em>A</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The completion of a Boolean algebra <em>A</em> can be constructed in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The completion is the Boolean algebra of regular open sets in the <a href="Stone_space" title="wikilink">Stone space</a> of prime ideals of <em>A</em>. Each element <em>x</em> of <em>A</em> corresponds to the open set of prime ideals not containing <em>x</em> (which open and closed, and therefore regular).</li>
<li>The completion is the Boolean algebra of regular cuts of <em>A</em>. Here a <em>cut</em> is a subset <em>U</em> of <em>A</em><sup>+</sup> (the non-zero elements of <em>A</em>) such that if <em>q</em> is in <em>U</em> and <em>p</em>≤<em>q</em> then <em>p</em> is in <em>U</em>, and is called <em>regular</em> if whenever <em>p</em> is not in <em>U</em> there is some <em>r</em> ≤ <em>p</em> such that <em>U</em> has no elements ≤<em>r</em>. Each element <em>p</em> of <em>A</em> corresponds to the cut of elements ≤<em>p</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If <em>A</em> is a metric space and <em>B</em> its completion then any isometry from <em>A</em> to a complete metric space <em>C</em> can be extended to a unique isometry from <em>B</em> to <em>C</em>. The analogous statement for complete Boolean algebras is not true: a homomorphism from a Boolean algebra <em>A</em> to a complete Boolean algebra <em>C</em> cannot necessarily be extended to a (supremum preserving) homomorphism of complete Boolean algebras from the completion <em>B</em> of <em>A</em> to <em>C</em>. (By Sikorski's extension theorem it can be extended to a homomorphism of Boolean algebras from <em>B</em> to <em>C</em>, but this will not in general be a homomorphism of complete Boolean algebras; in other words, it need not preserve suprema.)</p>
<h2 id="free-κ-complete-boolean-algebras">Free κ-complete Boolean algebras</h2>

<p>Unless the <a href="Axiom_of_Choice" title="wikilink">Axiom of Choice</a> is relaxed,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> free complete boolean algebras generated by a set do not exist (unless the set is finite). More precisely, for any cardinal κ, there is a complete Boolean algebra of cardinality 2<sup>κ</sup> greater than κ that is generated as a complete Boolean algebra by a countable subset; for example the Boolean algebra of regular open sets in the product space κ<sup>ω</sup>, where κ has the discrete topology. A countable generating set consists of all sets <em>a</em><sub><em>m</em>,<em>n</em></sub> for <em>m</em>, <em>n</em> integers, consisting of the elements <em>x</em>∈κ<sup>ω</sup> such that <em>x</em>(<em>m</em>)</p>
