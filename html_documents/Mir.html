<h1>Mir</h1>
<hr/>
<p><strong><em>Mir</em></strong> (, ; lit. <em>Peace</em>) was a <a href="space_station" title="wikilink">space station</a> that operated in <a href="low_Earth_orbit" title="wikilink">low Earth orbit</a> from 1986 to 2001, owned by the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> and later by <a class="uri" href="Russia" title="wikilink">Russia</a>. <em>Mir</em> was the first modular space station and was assembled in orbit from 1986 to 1996. It had a greater mass than any previous spacecraft. Until 21 March 2001 it was the largest <a href="artificial_satellite" title="wikilink">satellite</a> in orbit, succeeded by the <a href="International_Space_Station" title="wikilink">International Space Station</a> after Mir's <a href="Orbital_decay" title="wikilink">orbit decayed</a>. The station served as a <a class="uri" href="microgravity" title="wikilink">microgravity</a> <a class="uri" href="research" title="wikilink">research</a> <a class="uri" href="laboratory" title="wikilink">laboratory</a> in which crews conducted <a href="experiment" title="wikilink">experiments</a> in <a class="uri" href="biology" title="wikilink">biology</a>, <a href="human_biology" title="wikilink">human biology</a>, <a class="uri" href="physics" title="wikilink">physics</a>, <a class="uri" href="astronomy" title="wikilink">astronomy</a>, <a class="uri" href="meteorology" title="wikilink">meteorology</a> and spacecraft systems with a goal of developing technologies required for permanent occupation of <a href="Outer_space" title="wikilink">space</a>.</p>
<p><em>Mir</em> was the first continuously inhabited long-term research station in orbit and set the record for the longest continuous human presence in space at 3,644 days until 23 October 2010 when it was surpassed by the <a href="International_Space_Station" title="wikilink">ISS</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It holds the record for the longest single human spaceflight, with <a href="Valeri_Polyakov" title="wikilink">Valeri Polyakov</a> spending 437 days and 18 hours on the station between 1994 and 1995. <em>Mir</em> was occupied for a total of twelve and a half years out of its fifteen-year lifespan, having the capacity to support a resident crew of three, or larger crews for short term visits.</p>
<p>Following the success of the <a href="Salyut_programme" title="wikilink">Salyut programme</a>, <em>Mir</em> represented the next stage in the Soviet Union's space station programme. The first module of the station, known as the <a href="Mir_Core_Module" title="wikilink">core module</a> or base block, was launched in 1986, and followed by six further modules. <a href="Proton_(rocket)" title="wikilink">Proton</a> <a href="rocket" title="wikilink">rockets</a> were used to launch all of its components except for the <a href="Mir_Docking_Module" title="wikilink">docking module</a>, which was installed by <a href="space_shuttle" title="wikilink">space shuttle</a> mission <a class="uri" href="STS-74" title="wikilink">STS-74</a> in 1995. When complete, the station consisted of seven pressurised modules and several unpressurised components. Power was provided by several <a href="Photovoltaic_system#Photovoltaic_arrays" title="wikilink">photovoltaic arrays</a> attached directly to the modules. The station was <a href="Orbital_station-keeping" title="wikilink">maintained at an orbit</a> between  and  altitude and traveled at an average speed of 27,700 km/h (17,200 mph), completing 15.7 orbits per day.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The station was launched as part of the Soviet Union's <a href="Soviet_space_program" title="wikilink">manned spaceflight programme</a> effort to maintain a long-term research outpost in space, and, following the collapse of the USSR, was operated by the new <a href="Russian_Federal_Space_Agency" title="wikilink">Russian Federal Space Agency</a> (RKA). As a result, the vast majority of the station's crew were Russian; however, through international collaborations such as the <a class="uri" href="Intercosmos" title="wikilink">Intercosmos</a>, <a class="uri" href="Euromir" title="wikilink">Euromir</a> and <a href="Shuttle-Mir_Program" title="wikilink">Shuttle-<em>Mir</em></a> programmes, the station was made accessible to <a href="astronaut" title="wikilink">astronauts</a> from North America, several European nations and Japan. <em>Mir</em> <a href="Deorbit_of_Mir" title="wikilink">was deorbited</a> in March 2001 because of a lack of funding. The cost of the <em>Mir</em> programme was estimated by former RKA General Director <a href="Yuri_Koptev" title="wikilink">Yuri Koptev</a> in 2001 as $4.2 billion over its lifetime (including development, assembly and orbital operation).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>
<p><em>Mir</em> was authorised in a decree made on 17 February 1976 to design an improved model of the <a href="Salyut_program" title="wikilink">Salyut</a> DOS-17K space stations. Four Salyut space stations had already been launched since 1971, with three more being launched during <em>Mir</em>'s development. It was planned that the station's core module (<a href="Mir_Core_Module" title="wikilink">DOS-7</a> and the backup <a href="Zvezda_(ISS_module)" title="wikilink">DOS-8</a>) would be equipped with a total of four docking ports; two at either end of the station as with the Salyut stations, and an additional two ports on either side of a docking sphere at the front of the station to enable further modules to expand the station's capabilities. By August 1978, this had evolved to the final configuration of one aft port and five ports in a spherical compartment at the forward end of the station.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>It was originally planned that the ports would connect to  modules derived from the <a href="Soyuz_spacecraft" title="wikilink">Soyuz spacecraft</a>. These modules would have used a Soyuz propulsion module, as in Soyuz and <a href="Progress_spacecraft" title="wikilink">Progress</a>, and the descent and orbital modules would have been replaced with a long laboratory module.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> However, following a February 1979 governmental resolution, the programme was consolidated with <a href="Vladimir_Chelomei" title="wikilink">Vladimir Chelomei</a>'s manned <a class="uri" href="Almaz" title="wikilink">Almaz</a> military space station programme. The docking ports were reinforced to accommodate  space station modules based on the <a href="TKS_spacecraft" title="wikilink">TKS spacecraft</a>. <a href="S.P._Korolev_Rocket_and_Space_Corporation_Energia" title="wikilink">NPO Energia</a> was responsible for the overall space station, with work subcontracted to <a href="KB_Salyut" title="wikilink">KB Salyut</a>, due to ongoing work on the <a class="uri" href="Energia" title="wikilink">Energia</a> <a href="launch_vehicle" title="wikilink">rocket</a> and <a href="Salyut_7" title="wikilink">Salyut 7</a>, <a href="Soyuz_spacecraft#Soyuz-T_(1976-1986)" title="wikilink">Soyuz-T</a>, and <a href="Progress_spacecraft" title="wikilink">Progress</a> spacecraft. KB Salyut began work in 1979, and drawings were released in 1982 and 1983. New systems incorporated into the station included the Salyut 5B digital flight control computer and gyrodyne flywheels (taken from Almaz), <a href="Kurs_(docking_system)" title="wikilink">Kurs automatic rendezvous system</a>, <a href="Luch_(satellite)" title="wikilink"><em>Luch</em> satellite</a> communications system, <a href="Elektron_(ISS)" title="wikilink">Elektron</a> oxygen generators, and <a class="uri" href="Vozdukh" title="wikilink">Vozdukh</a> <a href="Rebreather#Carbon_dioxide_scrubber" title="wikilink">carbon dioxide scrubbers</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>By early 1984, work on <em>Mir</em> had ground to a halt while all resources were being put into the <a href="Buran_program" title="wikilink">Buran programme</a> in order to prepare the <a href="Buran_(spacecraft)" title="wikilink"><em>Buran</em> spacecraft</a> for flight testing. Funding resumed in early 1984 when <a href="Valentin_Glushko" title="wikilink">Valentin Glushko</a> was ordered by the <a href="Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Central Committee</a>'s Secretary for Space and Defence to orbit <em>Mir</em> by early 1986, in time for the <a href="27th_Congress_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">27th Communist Party Congress</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>It was clear that the planned processing flow could not be followed and still meet the 1986 launch date. It was decided on <a href="Cosmonautics_Day" title="wikilink">Cosmonaut's Day</a> (12 April) 1985 to ship the flight model of the <a href="Mir_Core_Module" title="wikilink">base block</a> to the <a href="Baikonur_cosmodrome" title="wikilink">Baikonur cosmodrome</a> and conduct the systems testing and integration there. The module arrived at the launch site on 6 May, with 1100 of 2500 cables requiring <a class="uri" href="rework" title="wikilink">rework</a> based on the results of tests to the ground test model at <a class="uri" href="Khrunichev" title="wikilink">Khrunichev</a>. In October, the base block was rolled outside its <a class="uri" href="cleanroom" title="wikilink">cleanroom</a> to carry out communications tests. The first launch attempt on 16 February 1986 was scrubbed when the spacecraft communications failed, but the second launch attempt, on 19 February 1986 at 21:28:23 UTC, was successful, meeting the political deadline.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

See adjacent text for details."></embed> The orbital assembly of <em>Mir</em> began in February 1986 with the launch of the <a href="Mir_Core_Module" title="wikilink">core module</a> on a <a class="uri" href="Proton-K" title="wikilink">Proton-K</a> rocket. Four of the six modules which were later added (<a href="Kvant-2" title="wikilink"><em>Kvant</em>-2</a> in 1989, <em><a class="uri" href="Kristall" title="wikilink">Kristall</a></em> in 1990, <em><a class="uri" href="Spektr" title="wikilink">Spektr</a></em> in 1995 and <em><a class="uri" href="Priroda" title="wikilink">Priroda</a></em> in 1996) followed the same sequence to add themselves to the main <em>Mir</em> complex. Firstly, the module would be launched independently on its own Proton-K and chase the station automatically. It would then dock to the forward docking port on the core module's docking node, then extend its <a href="Lyappa_arm" title="wikilink">Lyappa arm</a> to mate with a fixture on the node's exterior. The arm would then lift the module away from the forward docking port and rotate it on to the radial port that the module was to mate with, before lowering it down to dock. The node was equipped with only two <em>Konus</em> drogues, however, which were required for dockings. This meant that, prior to the arrival of each new module, the node would have to be depressurised to allow spacewalking cosmonauts to manually relocate the drogue to the next port to be occupied.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The other two expansion modules, <a href="Kvant-1" title="wikilink"><em>Kvant</em>-1</a> in 1987 and the <a href="Mir_Docking_Module" title="wikilink">docking module</a> in 1995, followed different procedures. <em>Kvant</em>-1, having, unlike the four modules mentioned above, no engines of its own, was launched attached to a tug based on the <a href="TKS_spacecraft" title="wikilink">TKS spacecraft</a> which delivered the module to the aft end of the core module instead of the docking node. Once hard docking had been achieved, the tug undocked and deorbited itself. The docking module, meanwhile, was launched aboard  during <a class="uri" href="STS-74" title="wikilink">STS-74</a> and mated to the orbiter's <a href="Orbiter_Docking_System" title="wikilink">Orbiter Docking System</a>. <em>Atlantis</em> then docked, via the module, to <em>Kristall</em>, then left the module behind when it undocked later in the mission.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Various other external components, including three truss structures, several experiments and other unpressurised elements were also mounted to the exterior of the station by cosmonauts conducting a total of eighty spacewalks over the course of the station's history.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The station's assembly marked the beginning of the third generation of space station design, being the first to consist of more than one primary spacecraft (thus opening a new era in <a href="space_architecture" title="wikilink">space architecture</a>). First generation stations such as <a href="Salyut_1" title="wikilink">Salyut 1</a> and <a class="uri" href="Skylab" title="wikilink">Skylab</a> had monolithic designs, consisting of one module with no resupply capability, whilst the second generation stations <a href="Salyut_6" title="wikilink">Salyut 6</a> and <a href="Salyut_7" title="wikilink">Salyut 7</a> comprised a monolithic station with two ports to allow consumables to be replenished by cargo spacecraft such as <a href="Progress_(spacecraft)" title="wikilink">Progress</a>. The capability of <em>Mir</em> to be expanded with add-on modules meant that each could be designed with a specific purpose in mind (for instance, the core module functioned largely as living quarters), thus eliminating the need to install all the station's equipment in one module.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="pressurised-modules">Pressurised modules</h3>
<p>In its completed configuration, the space station consisted of seven different modules, each launched into orbit separately over a period of ten years by either <a class="uri" href="Proton-K" title="wikilink">Proton-K</a> rockets or . {{-}}</p>

<h3 id="unpressurised-elements">Unpressurised elements</h3>
<p> In addition to the pressurised modules, <em>Mir</em> featured a large number of external components. The largest component was the <em>Sofora</em> girder, a large scaffolding-like structure consisting of 20 segments which, when assembled, projected 14 metres from its mount on <em>Kvant</em>-1. A self-contained thruster block, referred to as the VDU, was mounted on the end of <em>Sofora</em> and was used to augment the roll-control thrusters on the core module. The VDU's increased distance from <em>Mir</em>'s axis lead to an 85% decrease in fuel consumption, reducing the amount of propellant required to orient the station.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> A second girder, <em>Rapana</em>, was mounted aft of <em>Sofora</em> on <em>Kvant</em>-1. This girder, a scaled-down prototype of a structure intended to be used on <a href="Mir-2" title="wikilink"><em>Mir</em>-2</a> to hold large parabolic dishes away from the main station structure, was 5 metres long and used as a mounting point for externally mounted exposure experiments.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>To assist in moving objects around the exterior of the station during <a href="Extra-vehicular_activity" title="wikilink">EVAs</a>, <em>Mir</em> featured two <a href="Strela_(crane)" title="wikilink"><em>Strela</em> cargo cranes</a> mounted to the port and starboard sides of the core module and used for moving spacewalking cosmonauts and parts around the exterior of the station. The cranes consisted of telescopic poles assembled in sections which measured around  when collapsed, but when extended using a hand crank were  long, meaning that all of the station's modules could easily be accessed during spacewalks.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Each module was also fitted with a number of external components specific to the experiments that were carried out within that module, the most obvious being the Travers antenna mounted to <em>Priroda</em>. This <a href="synthetic_aperture_radar" title="wikilink">synthetic aperture radar</a> consisted of a large dish-like framework mounted to the exterior of the module, with associated equipment within, used for Earth observations experiments, as was most of the other equipment on <em>Priroda</em>, including various radiometers and scan platforms.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> <em>Kvant</em>-2 also featured a number of scan platforms and was also fitted with a mounting bracket to which the <a href="Astronaut_Propulsion_Unit#Soviet_SPK" title="wikilink">cosmonaut manoeuvring unit</a>, or <em>Ikar</em>, was mated. This backpack was designed to assist cosmonauts in moving around the station and the planned <em>Buran</em> in a manner similar to the U.S. <a href="Manned_Maneuvering_Unit" title="wikilink">Manned Maneuvering Unit</a>, but it was only used once, during <a href="Mir_EO-5" title="wikilink">EO-5</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to module-specific equipment, <em>Kvant</em>-2, <em>Kristall</em>, <em>Spektr</em> and <em>Priroda</em> were each equipped with one <a href="Lyappa_arm" title="wikilink"><em>Lyappa</em> arm</a>, a robotic arm which, after the module had docked to the core module's forward port, grappled one of two fixtures positioned on the core module's docking node. The arriving module's docking probe was then retracted, and the arm raised the module so that it could be pivoted 90° for docking to one of the four radial docking ports.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Photovoltaic_system#Photovoltaic_arrays" title="wikilink">Photovoltaic (PV) arrays</a> powered <em>Mir</em>. The station used a 28 <a class="uri" href="volt" title="wikilink">volt</a> <a href="direct_current" title="wikilink">DC</a> supply which provided 5-, 10-, 20- and 50-<a href="Ampere" title="wikilink">amp</a> taps. When the station was illuminated by sunlight, several solar arrays mounted on the pressurised modules provided power to <em>Mir</em>'s systems and charged the <a href="Nickel-cadmium_battery" title="wikilink">nickel-cadmium storage batteries</a> installed throughout the station.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The arrays rotated in only one degree of freedom over a 180° arc, and tracked the sun using sun sensors and motors installed in the array mounts. The station itself also had to be oriented to ensure optimum illumination of the arrays. When the station's all-sky sensor detected that <em>Mir</em> had entered Earth's shadow, the arrays were rotated to the optimum angle predicted for reacquiring the sun once the station passed out of the shadow. The batteries, which each had a capacity of 60 <a href="Ampere-hour" title="wikilink">Ah</a>, were then used to power the station until the arrays recovered their maximum output on the day side of Earth.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>The solar arrays themselves were launched and installed over a period of eleven years, more slowly than originally planned, with the station continually suffering from a shortage of power as a result. The first two arrays, each 38 m<sup>2</sup> (409 ft<sup>2</sup>) in area, were launched on the core module, and together provided a total of 9 kW of power. A third, <a href="Dorsum_(anatomy)" title="wikilink">dorsal</a> panel was launched on <em>Kvant</em>-1 and mounted on the core module in 1987, providing a further 2 kW over an area of 22 m<sup>2</sup> (237 ft<sup>2</sup>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> <em>Kvant</em>-2, launched in 1989, provided two 10 m (32.8 ft) long panels which supplied 3.5 kW each, whilst <em>Kristall</em> was launched with two collapsible, 15 m (49.2 ft) long arrays (providing 4 kW each) which were intended to be moved to <em>Kvant</em>-1 and installed on mounts which were attached during a spacewalk by the <a href="Soyuz_TM-11" title="wikilink">EO-8</a> crew in 1991.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>This relocation was not begun, however, until 1995, when the panels were retracted and the left panel installed on <em>Kvant</em>-1. By this time all the arrays had degraded and were supplying much less power than they originally had. To rectify this, <em>Spektr</em> (launched in 1995), which had initially been designed to carry two arrays, was modified to hold four, providing a total of 126 m<sup>2</sup> (1360 ft<sup>2</sup>) of array with a 16 kW supply.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Two further arrays were flown to the station on board the  during <a class="uri" href="STS-74" title="wikilink">STS-74</a>, carried on the docking module. The first of these, the <em>Mir</em> cooperative solar array, consisted of American photovoltaic cells mounted on a Russian frame. It was installed on the unoccupied mount on <em>Kvant</em>-1 in May 1996 and was connected to the socket that had previously been occupied by the core module's dorsal panel, which was by this point barely supplying 1 kW.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The other panel, originally intended to be launched on <em>Priroda</em>, replaced the <em>Kristall</em> panel on <em>Kvant</em>-1 in November 1997, completing the station's electrical system.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Total power supply by solar arrays, had the older ones not been degraded, would have been 42 kW by 1997.</p>
<h3 id="orbit-control">Orbit control</h3>
<p> <em>Mir</em> was maintained in a near circular orbit with an average perigee of  and an average apogee of , travelling at an average speed of 27,700 km/h (17,200 mph) and completing 15.7 orbits per day.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> As the station constantly lost altitude because of a slight <a href="atmospheric_drag" title="wikilink">atmospheric drag</a>, it needed to be boosted to a higher altitude several times each year. This boost was generally performed by Progress resupply vessels, although during the Shuttle-<em>Mir</em> programme the task was performed by U.S. Space Shuttles, and, prior to the arrival of <a class="uri" href="Kvant-1" title="wikilink">Kvant-1</a>, the engines on the core module could also accomplish the task.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Yaw,_pitch_and_roll#Aircraft_attitudes" title="wikilink">attitude</a> (orientation) of the station was independently determined by a set of externally mounted <a href="Attitude_dynamics_and_control#Absolute_attitude_sensors" title="wikilink">sun, star and horizon sensors</a>. Attitude information was conveyed between updates by rate sensors. Attitude control was maintained by a combination of two mechanisms; in order to hold a set attitude, a system of twelve <a href="control_moment_gyroscope" title="wikilink">control moment gyroscopes</a> (CMGs, or "gyrodynes") rotating at 10,000 <a href="Revolutions_per_minute" title="wikilink">rpm</a> kept the station oriented, six CMGs being located in each of the <em>Kvant-1</em> and <em>Kvant-2</em> modules.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> When the attitude of the station needed to be changed, the gyrodynes were disengaged, thrusters (including those mounted directly to the modules, and the VDU thruster used for roll control mounted to the <em>Sofora</em> girder) were used to attain the new attitude and the CMGs were reengaged.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> This was done fairly regularly depending on experimental needs; for instance, Earth or astronomical observations required that the instrument recording images be continuously aimed at the target, and so the station was oriented to make this possible.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Conversely, materials processing experiments required the minimisation of movement on board the station, and so <em>Mir</em> would be oriented in a <a href="gravity_gradient" title="wikilink">gravity gradient</a> attitude for stability.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Prior to the arrival of the modules containing these gyrodynes, the station's attitude was controlled using thrusters located on the core module alone, and, in an emergency, the thrusters on docked Soyuz spacecraft could be used to maintain the station's orientation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="communications">Communications</h3>
<p><a href="Radio" title="wikilink">Radio communications</a> provided <a class="uri" href="telemetry" title="wikilink">telemetry</a> and scientific data links between <em>Mir</em> and the <a href="TsUP" title="wikilink">RKA Mission Control Centre</a> (TsUP). Radio links were also used during <a href="Space_rendezvous" title="wikilink">rendezvous and docking procedures</a> and for audio and video communication between crew members, flight controllers and family members. As a result, <em>Mir</em> was equipped with a number of communication systems used for different purposes. The station communicated directly with the ground via the <a href="Lira_(ISS)" title="wikilink"><em>Lira</em></a> <a href="Antenna_(radio)" title="wikilink">antenna</a> mounted to the <a href="Mir_Core_Module" title="wikilink">core module</a>. The <em>Lira</em> antenna also had the capability to use the <a href="Luch_(satellite)" title="wikilink"><em>Luch</em></a> data relay satellite system (which fell into disrepair in the 1990s) and the network of Soviet <a href="tracking_ship" title="wikilink">tracking ships</a> deployed in various locations around the world (which also became unavailable in the 1990s).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> <a href="Ultra_high_frequency" title="wikilink">UHF radio</a> was used by cosmonauts conducting <a href="Extra-vehicular_activity" title="wikilink">EVAs</a>. UHF was also employed by other spacecraft that docked to or undocked from the station, such as Soyuz, Progress, and the Space Shuttle, in order to receive commands from the TsUP and <em>Mir</em> crew members via the <a class="uri" href="TORU" title="wikilink">TORU</a> system.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="microgravity">Microgravity</h3>
<p> At <em>Mir</em>'s orbital altitude, the force of Earth's gravity was 88% of that at sea level. While the constant free fall of the station offered a perceived sensation of <a class="uri" href="weightlessness" title="wikilink">weightlessness</a>, the onboard environment was not one of weightlessness or zero gravity. The environment was, however, often described as <a href="Micro-g_environment" title="wikilink">microgravity</a>. This state of perceived weightlessness was not perfect, however, being disturbed by five separate effects:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The drag resulting from the residual atmosphere,</li>
<li>Vibratory acceleration caused by mechanical systems and the crew on board the station,</li>
<li>Orbital corrections by the on-board gyroscopes (which spun at 10,000 rpm, producing vibrations of 166.67 <a href="Hertz" title="wikilink">Hz</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a>) or thrusters,</li>
<li><a href="Tidal_force" title="wikilink">Tidal forces</a>. Any parts of <em>Mir</em> not at exactly the same distance from Earth tended to <a href="Gravity-gradient_stabilization" title="wikilink">follow separate orbits</a>. However, as each point was physically part of the station, this was impossible, and so each component was subject to small accelerations from tidal forces.</li>
<li>The differences in orbital plane between different locations aboard the station.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="life-support">Life support</h3>
<p><em>Mir</em>'s <a href="Environmental_Control_and_Life_Support_System" title="wikilink">Environmental Control and Life Support System</a> (ECLSS) provided or controlled <a href="atmospheric_pressure" title="wikilink">atmospheric pressure</a>, fire detection, oxygen levels, waste management and water supply. The highest priority for the ECLSS was the station's atmosphere, but the system also collected, processed, and stored waste and water produced and used by the crew—a process that recycles fluid from the sink, toilet, and condensation from the air. The <a href="Elektron_(ISS)" title="wikilink"><em>Elektron</em></a> system generated oxygen on board the station. The crew had a backup option in the form of bottled oxygen and <a href="chemical_oxygen_generator" title="wikilink">Solid Fuel Oxygen Generation</a> (SFOG) canisters, a system known as <a href="Vika_oxygen_generator" title="wikilink"><em>Vika</em></a>. Carbon dioxide was removed from the air by the <em><a class="uri" href="Vozdukh" title="wikilink">Vozdukh</a></em> system.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Other by-products of human metabolism, such as methane from the intestines and ammonia from sweat, were removed by <a href="Activated_carbon" title="wikilink">activated charcoal</a> filters.

It commonly housed three crew members, but was capable of supporting as many as six for up to a month. The station was designed to remain in orbit for around five years, but ended up remaining in orbit for fifteen.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> As a result, NASA astronaut John Blaha reported that, with the exception of <em><a class="uri" href="Priroda" title="wikilink">Priroda</a></em> and <em><a class="uri" href="Spektr" title="wikilink">Spektr</a></em>, which were added later into the station's life, <em>Mir</em> did look used, which is to be expected given it had been lived in for ten to eleven years without being brought home and cleaned.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="crew-schedule">Crew schedule</h3>
<p>The time zone used on board <em>Mir</em> was <a href="Moscow_Time" title="wikilink">Moscow Time</a> (<a href="UTC+03:00" title="wikilink">UTC+03</a>). The windows were covered during night hours to give the impression of darkness because the station experienced 16 sunrises and sunsets a day. A typical day for the crew began with a wake-up at 08:00, followed by two hours of personal hygiene and breakfast. Work was conducted from 10:00 until 13:00, followed by an hour of exercise and an hour's lunch break. Three more hours of work and another hour of exercise followed lunch, and the crews began preparing for their evening meal at about 19:00. The cosmonauts were free to do as they wished in the evening, and largely worked to their own pace during the day.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>In their spare time, crews were able to catch up with work, observe the Earth below, respond to letters, drawings and other items sent up from Earth (and give them an official stamp to show they had been aboard <em>Mir</em>), or make use of the station's ham radio.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Two amateur radio call signs, U1MIR and U2MIR, were assigned to <em>Mir</em> in the late 1980s, allowing <a href="amateur_radio_operators" title="wikilink">amateur radio operators</a> on Earth to communicate with the cosmonauts.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn74" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> The station was also equipped with a large supply of books and films for the crew to read and watch.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn75" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>NASA astronaut Jerry Linenger related how life on board <em>Mir</em> was structured and lived according to the detailed itineraries provided by ground control. Every second on board was accounted for and all activities were timetabled. After working some time on <em>Mir</em>, Linenger came to feel that the order in which his activities were allocated did not represent the most logical or efficient order possible for these activities. He decided to perform his tasks in an order that he felt enabled him to work more efficiently, be less fatigued, and suffer less from stress. Linenger noted that his comrades on <em>Mir</em> did not "improvise" in this way, and as a medical doctor he observed the effects of stress on his comrades that he believed was the outcome of following an itinerary without making modifications to it. Despite this, however, he commented that his comrades performed all their tasks in a supremely professional manner.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn76" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>

The big difference with going to work here is the isolation, because you really are isolated. You don't have a lot of support from the ground. You really are on your own."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn77" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="exercise">Exercise</h3>
<p> The most significant adverse effects of long-term weightlessness are <a href="muscle_atrophy" title="wikilink">muscle atrophy</a> and deterioration of the <a class="uri" href="skeleton" title="wikilink">skeleton</a>, or <a href="spaceflight_osteopenia" title="wikilink">spaceflight osteopenia</a>. Other significant effects include fluid redistribution, a slowing of the <a href="cardiovascular_system" title="wikilink">cardiovascular system</a>, decreased production of <a href="red_blood_cell" title="wikilink">red blood cells</a>, balance disorders, and a weakening of the <a href="immune_system" title="wikilink">immune system</a>. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, excess <a class="uri" href="flatulence" title="wikilink">flatulence</a>, and puffiness of the face. These effects begin to reverse quickly upon return to the Earth.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn78" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>To prevent some of these adverse physiological effects, the station was equipped with two <a href="treadmill" title="wikilink">treadmills</a> (in the core module and <em>Kvant</em>-2) and a <a href="stationary_bicycle" title="wikilink">stationary bicycle</a> (in the core module); each cosmonaut was to cycle the equivalent of  and run the equivalent of  per day.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn79" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Cosmonauts used bungee cords to strap themselves to the treadmill. Researchers believe that exercise is a good countermeasure for the bone and muscle density loss that occurs when humans live for a long time without gravity.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn80" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="hygiene">Hygiene</h3>
<p>There were two <a href="space_toilet" title="wikilink">space toilets</a> (ASUs) on <em>Mir</em>, located in the <a href="Mir_Core_Module" title="wikilink">core module</a> and <a href="Kvant-2" title="wikilink"><em>Kvant</em>-2</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn81" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> These units used a fan-driven suction system similar to the Space Shuttle Waste Collection System. Cosmonauts first fastened themselves to the toilet seat, which was equipped with spring-loaded restraining bars to ensure a good seal. A lever operated a powerful fan and a suction hole slid open: the air stream carried the waste away. Solid waste was collected in individual bags which were stored in an aluminium container. Full containers were transferred to Progress spacecraft for disposal. Liquid waste was evacuated by a hose connected to the front of the toilet, with anatomically appropriate "urine funnel adapters" attached to the tube so both men and women could use the same toilet. Waste was collected and transferred to the Water Recovery System, where it was recycled back into drinking water, although this was usually used to produce oxygen via the <a href="Elektron_(ISS)" title="wikilink"><em>Elektron</em></a> system.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn82" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Mir</em> featured a shower, referred to as <em>Bania</em>, which was located in <em>Kvant</em>-2. The unit was a major improvement on the units installed in previous <a href="Salyut_program" title="wikilink">Salyut</a> stations, but proved difficult to use due to the amount of time required to set up, use, and pack it away. The shower, which featured a plastic curtain and fan to collect water via an airflow, was later converted into a steam room, eventually having its plumbing removed and the space was reused. When the shower was unavailable, crew members washed using wet wipes, with soap dispensed from a toothpaste tube-like container, or using a washbasin equipped with a plastic hood, located in the core module. Crews were also provided with rinse-less shampoo and edible toothpaste to save water.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn83" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>On a 1998 visit to <em>Mir</em>, bacteria and larger organisms were found to have proliferated in water globules formed from moisture that had condensed behind service panels.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn84" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="sleeping-in-space">Sleeping in space</h3>
<p> The station provided two permanent crew quarters, called "Kayutkas". These were phonebox-sized booths set towards the rear of the core module, each featuring a tethered sleeping bag, a fold-out desk and a porthole, in addition to storage for a cosmonaut's personal effects. Visiting crews had no allocated sleep module, instead attaching a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall; American astronauts installed themselves within <em><a class="uri" href="Spektr" title="wikilink">Spektr</a></em> until a collision with a Progress spacecraft caused the depressurization of that module.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn85" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> It was important that crew accommodations be well ventilated; otherwise, astronauts could wake up oxygen-deprived and gasping for air, because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide had formed around their heads.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn86" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="food-and-drink">Food and drink</h3>
<p>Most of the food eaten by station crews was frozen, refrigerated or canned. Menus were prepared by the cosmonauts, with the help of a <a class="uri" href="dietitian" title="wikilink">dietitian</a>, before their flight to the station. The diet was designed to provide around 100 g of <a class="uri" href="protein" title="wikilink">protein</a>, 130 g of <a class="uri" href="fat" title="wikilink">fat</a> and 330 g of <a href="carbohydrate" title="wikilink">carbohydrates</a> per day, in addition to appropriate mineral and vitamin supplements. Meals were spread out throughout the day to aid assimilation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn87" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Canned food such as jellied beef tongue was placed into one of several niches in the core module's table, where they could be warmed in 5–10 minutes. Usually, crews drank tea, coffee and fruit juices, but, unlike the ISS, the station also had a supply of <a href="Cognac_(brandy)" title="wikilink">cognac</a> and <a class="uri" href="vodka" title="wikilink">vodka</a> for special occasions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn88" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="microbiological-environmental-hazards">Microbiological environmental hazards</h3>
<p>In the 1990s samples of <a class="uri" href="extremophile" title="wikilink">extremophile</a> molds were taken from Mir. There were found 90 species of micro-organisms in 1990, four years after launching the station. By the time of decommissioning the station in 2001, the number of known different micro-organisms had grown to 140. As space stations get older, the problems with contamination get worse.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn89" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Molds that develop aboard space stations can produce acids that degrade metal, glass and rubber.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn90" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> The molds in Mir were found growing behind panels and inside air-conditioning equipment. The molds also caused bad smell, which was often said to have been the biggest impression left for the visitors on the station.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn91" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p>Some biologists were concerned about the mutant fungi being a major microbiological hazard for humans, and reaching Earth in the splashdown, after having been in an isolated environment for 15 years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn92" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="expeditions">Expeditions</h3>
<p>During its 15-year spaceflight, <em>Mir</em> was visited by a total of 28 long-duration or "principal" crews, each of which was given a sequential expedition number formatted as EO-X. Expeditions varied in length (from the 72-day flight of the crew of <a href="Mir_EO-28" title="wikilink">EO-28</a> to the 437-day flight of <a href="Valeri_Polyakov" title="wikilink">Valeri Polyakov</a>), but generally lasted around six months.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn93" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Principal expedition crews consisted of two to three crew members, who often launched as part of one expedition but returned with another (Polyakov launched with EO-14 and landed with EO-17).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn94" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> The principal expeditions were often supplemented with visiting crews who remained on the station during the week-long handover period between one crew and the next before returning with the departing crew, the station's life support system being able to support a crew of up to six for short periods.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn95" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn96" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> The station was occupied for a total of four distinct periods; 12 March–16 July 1986 (<a href="Mir_EO-1" title="wikilink">EO-1</a>), 5 February 1987 – 27 April 1989 (EO-2–EO-4), the record-breaking run from 5 September 1989 – 28 August 1999 (EO-5–EO-27), and 4 April–16 June 2000 (<a href="Mir_EO-28" title="wikilink">EO-28</a>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn97" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> By the time of the station's deorbit, it had been <a href="List_of_Mir_visitors" title="wikilink">visited by 104 different people from twelve different nations</a>, making it the most visited spacecraft in history (a record later <a href="List_of_International_Space_Station_visitors" title="wikilink">surpassed by the International Space Station</a>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn98" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="early-existence">Early existence</h4>
<p> Due to the pressure to launch the station in such short order, mission planners were left without Soyuz spacecraft or modules to launch to the station at first. It was decided to launch <a href="Soyuz_T-15" title="wikilink">Soyuz T-15</a> on a dual mission to both <em>Mir</em> and <a href="Salyut_7" title="wikilink">Salyut 7</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn99" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Leonid_Kizim" title="wikilink">Leonid Kizim</a> and <a href="Vladimir_Solovyov_(cosmonaut)" title="wikilink">Vladimir Solovyov</a> first docked with the Mir space station on 15 March 1986. During their nearly 51-day stay on <em>Mir</em>, they brought the station online and checked its systems. They also unloaded two <a href="Progress_spacecraft" title="wikilink">Progress spacecraft</a> launched after their arrival, <a href="Progress_25" title="wikilink">Progress 25</a> and <a href="Progress_26" title="wikilink">Progress 26</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn100" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p>On 5 May 1986, they undocked from <em>Mir</em> for a day-long journey to Salyut 7. They spent 51 days there and gathered 400 kg of scientific material from Salyut 7 for return to <em>Mir</em>. While Soyuz T-15 was at Salyut 7, the unmanned <a href="Soyuz_TM-1" title="wikilink">Soyuz TM-1</a> arrived at the unoccupied <em>Mir</em> and remained for 9 days, testing the new <a href="Soyuz_spacecraft#Soyuz-TM_(1986-2003)" title="wikilink">Soyuz TM</a> model. Soyuz T-15 redocked with <em>Mir</em> on 26 June and delivered the experiments and 20 instruments, including a multichannel <a class="uri" href="spectrometer" title="wikilink">spectrometer</a>. The EO-1 crew spent their last 20 days on <em>Mir</em> conducting Earth observations before returning to Earth on 16 July 1986, leaving the new station unoccupied.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn101" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p>The second expedition to <em>Mir</em>, <a href="Mir_EO-2" title="wikilink">EO-2</a>, launched on <a href="Soyuz_TM-2" title="wikilink">Soyuz TM-2</a> on 5 February 1987. During their stay, the <a href="Kvant-1" title="wikilink"><em>Kvant</em>-1</a> module, launched on 30 March 1987, arrived. It was the first experimental version of a planned series of '37K' modules scheduled to be launched to <em>Mir</em> on the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet</a> <em>Buran</em> spacecraft. <em>Kvant</em>-1 was originally planned to dock with <a href="Salyut_7" title="wikilink">Salyut 7</a>; however, due to technical problems during its development, it was reassigned to <em>Mir</em>. The module carried the first set of six gyroscopes for attitude control. The module also carried instruments for X-ray and ultraviolet astrophysical observations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn102" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<p>The initial rendezvous of the <em>Kvant</em>-1 module with <em>Mir</em> on 5 April 1987 was troubled by the failure of the onboard control system. After the failure of the second attempt to dock, the resident cosmonauts, <a href="Yuri_Romanenko" title="wikilink">Yuri Romanenko</a> and <a href="Aleksandr_Laveykin" title="wikilink">Aleksandr Laveykin</a>, conducted an EVA to fix the problem. They found a trash bag which had been left in orbit after the departure of one of the previous cargo ships and was now located between the module and the station, which prevented the docking. After removing the bag docking could be completed on 12 April.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn103" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn104" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<p>The Soyuz TM-2 launch was the beginning of a string of 6 Soyuz launches and three long-duration crews between 5 February 1987 and 27 April 1989. This period also saw the first international visitors to the station, <a href="Muhammed_Faris" title="wikilink">Muhammed Faris</a> (<a class="uri" href="Syria" title="wikilink">Syria</a>), <a href="Abdul_Ahad_Mohmand" title="wikilink">Abdul Ahad Mohmand</a> (<a class="uri" href="Afghanistan" title="wikilink">Afghanistan</a>) and <a href="Jean-Loup_Chrétien" title="wikilink">Jean-Loup Chrétien</a> (<a class="uri" href="France" title="wikilink">France</a>). With the departure of <a href="Mir_EO-4" title="wikilink">EO-4</a> on <a href="Soyuz_TM-7" title="wikilink">Soyuz TM-7</a> on 27 April 1989 the station was once again left unoccupied.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn105" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="third-start">Third start</h4>
<p>The launch of <a href="Soyuz_TM-8" title="wikilink">Soyuz TM-8</a> on 5 September 1989 marked the beginning of the longest human presence in space up until 23 October 2010 (when this record was surpassed by the ISS).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn106" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> It also marked the beginning of <em>Mir's</em> second expansion. The <a class="uri" href="Kvant-2" title="wikilink">Kvant-2</a> and <em><a class="uri" href="Kristall" title="wikilink">Kristall</a></em> modules were now ready for launch. <a href="Alexander_Viktorenko" title="wikilink">Alexander Viktorenko</a> and <a href="Aleksandr_Serebrov" title="wikilink">Aleksandr Serebrov</a> docked with <em>Mir</em> and brought the station out of its five-month hibernation. On 29 September the cosmonauts installed equipment in the docking system in preparation for the arrival of <em>Kvant</em>-2, the first of the 20 <a class="uri" href="tonne" title="wikilink">tonne</a> add-on modules based on the <a href="TKS_spacecraft" title="wikilink">TKS spacecraft</a> from the <a class="uri" href="Almaz" title="wikilink">Almaz</a> programme.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn107" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
<p> After a delay of 40 days due to problems with a batch of computer chips, <em>Kvant</em>-2 was launched on 26 November 1989. After problems deploying the craft's solar array and with the automated docking systems on both <em>Kvant</em>-2 and <em>Mir</em>, the new module was docked manually on 6 December. <em>Kvant</em>-2 added a second set of gyrodines to <em>Mir</em>, and also carried the new life support systems for recycling water and generating oxygen on board the station, reducing its dependence on resupply from the ground. The module also featured a large airlock with a one-metre hatch. A special backpack unit (known as <em>Ikar</em>), an equivalent of the U.S. <a href="Manned_Maneuvering_Unit" title="wikilink">MMU</a>, was located inside <em>Kvant</em>-2's airlock.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn108" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn109" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Soyuz_TM-9" title="wikilink">Soyuz TM-9</a> launched <a href="Mir_EO-6" title="wikilink">EO-6</a> crew members <a href="Anatoly_Solovyev" title="wikilink">Anatoly Solovyev</a> and <a href="Aleksandr_Nikolayevich_Balandin" title="wikilink">Aleksandr Balandin</a> on 11 February 1990. While docking, the EO-5 crew on board <em>Mir</em> noted that three thermal blankets on the ferry were loose, potentially creating problems on reentry, but it was decided that they would be manageable. Their stay on board <em>Mir</em> saw the addition of the <em>Kristall</em> module, launched on 31 May 1990. The first docking attempt on 6 June was aborted due to an attitude control thruster failure. <em>Kristall</em> arrived at Mir’s front port on 10 June and was relocated to the lateral port opposite <em>Kvant</em>-2 the next day, restoring the equilibrium of the complex. Due to the delay in the docking of <em>Kristall</em>, EO-6 was extended by 10 days to permit the activation of the module’s systems and to accommodate the EVA to repair the loose thermal blankets on Soyuz TM-9.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn110" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Kristall</em> contained furnaces for use in producing crystals under microgravity conditions (hence the choice of name for the module). The module was also equipped with biotechnology research equipment, including a small greenhouse for plant cultivation experiments which was equipped with a source of light and a feeding system, in addition to equipment for astronomical observations. The most obvious features of the module, however, were the two <a href="Androgynous_Peripheral_Attach_System" title="wikilink">Androgynous Peripheral Attach System</a> (APAS-89) docking ports designed to be compatible with the <em>Buran</em> spacecraft. Although they were never used in a <em>Buran</em> docking, they were later to prove very useful during the Shuttle-<em>Mir</em> programme, providing a berthing location for U.S <a href="Space_Shuttle" title="wikilink">Space Shuttles</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn111" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>

<p>The first manned mission flown from an independent <a class="uri" href="Kazakhstan" title="wikilink">Kazakhstan</a> was <a href="Soyuz_TM-14" title="wikilink">Soyuz TM-14</a>, launched on 17 March 1992, which carried the <a href="Mir_EO-11" title="wikilink">EO-11</a> crew to <em>Mir</em>, docking on 19 March before the departure of Soyuz TM-13. On 17 June, Russian President <a href="Boris_Yeltsin" title="wikilink">Boris Yeltsin</a> and U.S. President <a href="George_H._W._Bush" title="wikilink">George H. W. Bush</a> announced what would later become the Shuttle-<em>Mir</em> programme, a cooperative venture which would prove very useful to the cash-strapped Roskosmos (and led to the eventual completion and launch of <em>Spektr</em> and <em>Priroda</em>). <a href="Mir_EO-12" title="wikilink">EO-12</a> followed in July, alongside a brief visit by French astronaut <a href="Michel_Tognini" title="wikilink">Michel Tognini</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn116" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> The crew which succeeded them, <a href="Mir_EO-13" title="wikilink">EO-13</a>, began preparations for the Shuttle-<em>Mir</em> programme by flying to the station in a modified spacecraft, <a href="Soyuz_TM-16" title="wikilink">Soyuz TM-16</a> (launched on 26 January 1993), which was equipped with an <a class="uri" href="APAS-89" title="wikilink">APAS-89</a> docking system rather than the usual probe-and-drogue, enabling it to dock to <em>Kristall</em> and test the port which would later be used by U.S. space shuttles. The spacecraft also enabled controllers to obtain data on the dynamics of docking a spacecraft to a space station off the station's longitudinal axis, in addition to data on the structural integrity of this configuration via a test called <em>Rezonans</em> conducted on 28 January. <a href="Soyuz_TM-15" title="wikilink">Soyuz TM-15</a>, meanwhile, departed with the EO-12 crew on 1 February.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn117" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a></p>
<p>Throughout the period following the collapse of the USSR, crews on <em>Mir</em> experienced occasional reminders of the <a href="History_of_post-Soviet_Russia#Economic_depression_and_social_decay" title="wikilink">economic chaos</a> occurring in Russia. The initial cancellation of <em>Spektr</em> and <em>Priroda</em> was the first such sign, closely followed by the reduction in communications as a result of the fleet of <a href="tracking_ship" title="wikilink">tracking ships</a> being withdrawn from service by <a class="uri" href="Ukraine" title="wikilink">Ukraine</a>. The new Ukrainian government also vastly raised the price of the <a href="Kurs_(docking_system)" title="wikilink"><em>Kurs</em></a> docking systems, manufactured in <a class="uri" href="Kiev" title="wikilink">Kiev</a>the Russians' attempts to reduce their dependence on <em>Kurs</em> would later lead to accidents during TORU tests in 1997. Various Progress spacecraft had parts of their cargoes missing, either because the consumable in question had been unavailable, or because the ground crews at Baikonur had, in desperation, looted them. The problems became particularly obvious during the launch of the <a href="Mir_EO-14" title="wikilink">EO-14</a> crew aboard <a href="Soyuz_TM-17" title="wikilink">Soyuz TM-17</a> in July; half an hour before launch there was a black-out at the pad, and the entire power supply to the nearby city of <a href="Baikonur" title="wikilink">Leninsk</a> failed an hour after launch.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn118" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn119" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> Nevertheless, the spacecraft launched on time and arrived at the station two days later. All of <em>Mir</em>'s ports, however, were occupied, and so Soyuz TM-17 had to station-keep 200 metres away from the station for half an hour before docking whilst <a href="Progress_M-18" title="wikilink">Progress M-18</a> vacated the core module's front port and departed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn120" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>

A spacewalk was conducted on 28 September to inspect the station's hull, but no serious damage was reported. <a href="Soyuz_TM-18" title="wikilink">Soyuz TM-18</a> arrived on 10 January 1994 carrying the <a href="Mir_EO-15" title="wikilink">EO-15</a> crew (including <a href="Valeri_Polyakov" title="wikilink">Valeri Polyakov</a>, who was to remain on <em>Mir</em> for 14 months), and <a href="Soyuz_TM-17" title="wikilink">Soyuz TM-17</a> left on 14 January. The undocking was unusual, however, in that the spacecraft was to pass along <em>Kristall</em> in order to obtain photographs of the APAS to assist in the training of space shuttle pilots. Due to an error in setting up the control system, the spacecraft struck the station a glancing blow during the manoeuvre, scratching the exterior of <em>Kristall</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn121" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>
<p>On 3 February 1994, <em>Mir</em> veteran <a href="Sergei_Krikalev" title="wikilink">Sergei Krikalev</a> became the first Russian cosmonaut to launch on a U.S. spacecraft, flying on  during <a class="uri" href="STS-60" title="wikilink">STS-60</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn122" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>
<p>The launch of <a href="Soyuz_TM-19" title="wikilink">Soyuz TM-19</a>, carrying the <a href="Mir_EO-16" title="wikilink">EO-16</a> crew, was delayed due to the unavailability of a payload fairing for the booster that was to carry it, but the spacecraft eventually left Earth on 1 July 1994 and docked two days later. They stayed only four months to allow the Soyuz schedule to line up with the planned space shuttle manifest, and so Polyakov greeted a second resident crew in October, prior to the undocking of Soyuz TM-19, when the <a href="Mir_EO-17" title="wikilink">EO-17</a> crew arrived in <a href="Soyuz_TM-20" title="wikilink">Soyuz TM-20</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn123" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>

<p>Lucid's stay aboard <em>Mir</em> ended with the flight of <em>Atlantis</em> on <a class="uri" href="STS-79" title="wikilink">STS-79</a>, which launched on 16 September.

In all, Blaha spent four months with the EO-22 crew before returning to Earth aboard <em>Atlantis</em> on <a class="uri" href="STS-81" title="wikilink">STS-81</a> in January 1997, at which point he was replaced by <a class="uri" href="physician" title="wikilink">physician</a> <a href="Jerry_Linenger" title="wikilink">Jerry Linenger</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn141" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn142" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn143" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> During his flight, Linenger became the first American to conduct a spacewalk from a foreign space station and the first to test the Russian-built <a href="Orlan_space_suit" title="wikilink">Orlan-M</a> spacesuit alongside Russian cosmonaut <a href="Vasili_Tsibliyev" title="wikilink">Vasili Tsibliyev</a>, flying <a href="Mir_EO-23" title="wikilink">EO-23</a>.

The crew carried out three EVAs to retrieve experiments and deploy a prototype communications antenna on <em>Sofora</em>. Meanwhile, on 1 June it was announced that the deorbit of the station would be delayed by six months to allow time to seek alternative funding to keep the station operating. The rest of the expedition was spent preparing the station for its deorbit; a special analogue computer was installed and each of the modules, starting with the docking module, was mothballed in turn and sealed off. The crew loaded their results into Soyuz TM-29 and departed <em>Mir</em> on 28 August 1999, ending a run of continuous occupation of the station which had lasted for eight days short of ten years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn163" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> The station's gyrodynes and main computer were shut down on 7 September, leaving <a href="Progress_M-42" title="wikilink">Progress M-42</a> to control <em>Mir</em> and refine the station's orbital decay rate.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn164" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a></p>

<p> <em>Mir</em> was primarily supported by the Russian <a href="Soyuz_spacecraft" title="wikilink">Soyuz</a> and <a href="Progress_spacecraft" title="wikilink">Progress spacecraft</a> and had two ports available for docking these spacecraft. Initially, the fore and aft ports of the core module could be used for dockings, but following the permanent berthing of <em>Kvant</em>-1 to the aft port in 1987, the rear port of the new module took on this role from the core module's aft port. Each port was equipped with the plumbing required for Progress cargo ferries to replace the station's fluids and also the guidance systems needed to guide the spacecraft in for docking. Two such systems were used on <em>Mir</em>; the rear ports of both the core module and <em>Kvant</em>-1 were equipped with both the <a href="Igla_(spacecraft_docking_system)" title="wikilink">Igla</a> and <a href="Kurs_(docking_system)" title="wikilink">Kurs</a> systems, whilst the core module's forward port featured only the newer Kurs.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn169" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>
<p>Soyuz spacecraft provided manned access to and from the station allowing for crew rotations and cargo return, and also functioned as a lifeboat for the station, allowing for a relatively quick return to Earth in the event of an emergency.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn170" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn171" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> Two models of Soyuz flew to <em>Mir</em>; <a href="Soyuz_T-15" title="wikilink">Soyuz T-15</a> was the only Igla-equipped <a class="uri" href="Soyuz-T" title="wikilink">Soyuz-T</a> to visit the station, whilst all other flights used the newer, Kurs-equipped <a class="uri" href="Soyuz-TM" title="wikilink">Soyuz-TM</a>. A total of 31 (30 manned, <a href="Soyuz_TM-1" title="wikilink">1 unmanned</a>) Soyuz spacecraft flew to the station over a fourteen-year period.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn172" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a></p>
<p>The unmanned Progress cargo vehicles were only used to resupply the station, carrying a variety of cargoes including water, fuel, food and experimental equipment. The spacecraft were not equipped with reentry shielding and so, unlike their Soyuz counterparts, were incapable of surviving reentry.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn173" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> As a result, when its cargoes had been unloaded, each Progress was refilled with rubbish, spent equipment and other waste which was destroyed, along with the Progress itself, on reentry.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn174" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> However, in order to facilitate cargo return, ten Progress flights carried <a href="VBK-Raduga" title="wikilink"><em>Raduga</em></a> capsules, which could return around 150 kg of experimental results to Earth automatically.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn175" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> <em>Mir</em> was visited by three separate models of Progress; the original <a href="Progress_7K-TG" title="wikilink">7K-TG</a> variant equipped with Igla (18 flights), the <a class="uri" href="Progress-M" title="wikilink">Progress-M</a> model equipped with Kurs (43 flights), and the modified <a class="uri" href="Progress-M1" title="wikilink">Progress-M1</a> version (3 flights), which together flew a total of sixty-four resupply missions to the station.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn176" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> Whilst the vast majority of the Progress spacecraft docked automatically without incident, the station was equipped with a remote manual docking system, <a class="uri" href="TORU" title="wikilink">TORU</a>, in case problems were encountered during the automatic approaches. With TORU cosmonauts could guide the spacecraft safely in to dock (with the exception of the catastrophic docking of <a href="Progress_M-34" title="wikilink">Progress M-34</a>, when the long-range use of the system resulted in the spacecraft's striking the station, damaging <em>Spektr</em> and causing <a href="Uncontrolled_decompression" title="wikilink">decompression</a>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn177" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to the routine Soyuz and Progress flights, it was anticipated that <em>Mir</em> would also be the destination for flights by the Soviet <a href="Buran_program" title="wikilink"><em>Buran</em> space shuttle</a>, which was intended to deliver extra modules (based on the same "37K" <a href="Satellite_bus" title="wikilink">bus</a> as <em>Kvant</em>-1) and provide a much improved cargo return service to the station. <em><a class="uri" href="Kristall" title="wikilink">Kristall</a></em> carried two <a href="Androgynous_Peripheral_Attach_System" title="wikilink">Androgynous Peripheral Attach System</a> (APAS-89) docking ports designed to be compatible with the shuttle. One of these ports was to be used for <em>Buran</em> dockings with the other providing a berthing location for the planned <em>Pulsar</em> X-2 telescope, also to be delivered by <em>Buran</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn178" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn179" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> The cancellation of the <em>Buran</em> programme, however, meant these capabilities were not realised until the 1990s when the ports were used instead by U.S. <a href="Space_Shuttle" title="wikilink">Space Shuttles</a> as part of the Shuttle-<em>Mir</em> programme (after testing by the specially modified <a href="Soyuz_TM-16" title="wikilink">Soyuz TM-16</a> in 1993). Initially, visiting <a href="Space_Shuttle_orbiter" title="wikilink">orbiters</a> docked directly to <em>Kristall</em>, but this required the relocation of the module to ensure sufficient distance between the shuttle and <em>Mir</em>'s solar arrays.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn180" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> In order to eliminate the need to move the module and retract solar arrays for clearance issues, a <a href="Mir_Docking_Module" title="wikilink">docking module</a> was later added to the end of <em>Kristall</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn181" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> The shuttles provided crew rotation of the American astronauts on station and carried cargo to and from the station, performing some of the largest transfers of cargo of the time.

<h3 id="mission-control-centre">Mission control centre</h3>
<p> <em>Mir</em> and the spacecraft visiting the station were controlled from the Russian <a href="Mission_control_center" title="wikilink">mission control centre</a> () in <a href="Korolyov_(city)" title="wikilink">Korolyov</a>, near the <a href="RKK_Energia" title="wikilink">RKK Energia</a> plant. Referred to by its acronym ЦУП ("TsUP"), or simply as 'Moscow', the facility could process data from up to ten spacecraft in three separate control rooms, although each control room was dedicated to a single programme; one to <em>Mir</em>; one to Soyuz; and one to the Soviet space shuttle Buran (which was later converted for use with the ISS).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn183" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn184" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> The facility is now used to control the <a href="Russian_Orbital_Segment" title="wikilink">Russian Orbital Segment</a> of the ISS.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn185" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> The flight control team were assigned roles similar to the system used by NASA at their mission control centre in <a class="uri" href="Houston" title="wikilink">Houston</a>, including:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn186" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="aging-systems-and-atmosphere">Aging systems and atmosphere</h4>
<p>In the later years of the programme, particularly during the Shuttle-<em>Mir</em> programme, <em>Mir</em> suffered from various systems failures as the station aged. The station was originally designed to fly for five years but eventually flew for three times that length of time, and in the 1990s was showing its age—constant computer crashes, loss of power, uncontrolled tumbles through space and leaking pipes were an ever-present concern for crews. NASA astronaut <a href="John_Blaha" title="wikilink">John Blaha</a>'s account of the air quality on <em>Mir</em>—"very healthy, it's not dry, it's not humid. Nothing smells."—contradicts sharply the concerns about air quality on the space station that <a href="Jerry_Linenger" title="wikilink">Jerry Linenger</a> relates in his book about his time on the facility. Linenger says that due to the age of the space station, the cooling system on board had developed a plethora of tiny leaks too small and numerous to be repaired, that permitted the constant release of <a class="uri" href="coolant" title="wikilink">coolant</a>, making it unpleasant to breathe the air on board. He says that it was especially noticeable after he had made a spacewalk and become used to the clean air he had been breathing in his spacesuit. When he returned to the station and again began breathing the air inside <em>Mir</em>, he was deeply shocked by the intensity of the chemical smell and very worried about the possible negative health effects of breathing such heavily contaminated air.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn187" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a></p>
<p>Various breakdowns of <em>Mir</em>'s Elektron oxygen-generating system were also a concern. These breakdowns led crews to become increasingly reliant on the backup <a href="Vika_oxygen_generator" title="wikilink"><em>Vika</em></a> <a href="chemical_oxygen_generator" title="wikilink">solid-fuel oxygen generator</a> (SFOG) systems, responsible for the fire during the handover between EO-22 and EO-23.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn188" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn189" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> (see also <a href="ISS_ECLSS#Vika" title="wikilink">ISS ECLSS</a>)</p>
<h4 id="accidents">Accidents</h4>
<p> During the operation of <em>Mir</em>, a number of accidents occurred which threatened the safety of the station, such as the glancing collision between <em><a class="uri" href="Kristall" title="wikilink">Kristall</a></em> and <a href="Soyuz_TM-17" title="wikilink">Soyuz TM-17</a> during proximity operations in January 1994. The three most alarming incidents, however, occurred during <a href="Mir_EO-23" title="wikilink">EO-23</a>. The first of these, on 23 February 1997 during the handover period from <a href="Mir_EO-22" title="wikilink">EO-22</a> to EO-23, followed a malfunction in one of the station's backup <a href="Vika_oxygen_generator" title="wikilink"><em>Vika</em></a> system, a <a href="chemical_oxygen_generator" title="wikilink">chemical oxygen generator</a> later known as solid-fuel oxygen generator (SFOG). The <em>Vika</em> malfunction led to a fire which burned for around 90 seconds (according to official sources at the TsUP; astronaut <a href="Jerry_M._Linenger" title="wikilink">Jerry Linenger</a>, however, insists the fire burned for around 14 minutes), and produced large amounts of toxic smoke that filled the station for around 45 minutes. This forced the crew to don respirators, but some of the respirator masks initially worn were broken. Some of the <a href="fire_extinguisher" title="wikilink">fire extinguishers</a> mounted on the walls of the newer modules were immovable.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn190" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn191" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a>  The other two accidents which occurred during EO-23 concerned testing of the station's <a class="uri" href="TORU" title="wikilink">TORU</a> manual docking system to manually dock <a href="Progress_M-33" title="wikilink">Progress M-33</a> and <a href="Progress_M-34" title="wikilink">Progress M-34</a>. The tests were called in order to gauge the performance of long-distance docking and the feasibility of removal of the expensive <a href="Kurs_(docking_system)" title="wikilink"><em>Kurs</em></a> automatic docking system from Progress spacecraft. However, due to malfunctioning equipment, both tests failed, with Progress M-33 narrowly missing the station and Progress M-34 striking <em><a class="uri" href="Spektr" title="wikilink">Spektr</a></em> and puncturing the module, causing the station to depressurise and leading to <em>Spektr</em> being permanently sealed off. This in turn led to a power crisis aboard <em>Mir</em> as the module's solar arrays produced a large proportion of the station's electrical supply, causing the station to power down and begin to drift, requiring weeks of work to rectify before work could continue as normal.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn192" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn193" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="radiation-and-orbital-debris">Radiation and orbital debris</h4>
<p> Without the protection of the Earth's atmosphere, cosmonauts were exposed to higher levels of <a class="uri" href="radiation" title="wikilink">radiation</a> from a steady flux of <a href="cosmic_ray" title="wikilink">cosmic rays</a> and trapped protons from the <a href="South_Atlantic_Anomaly" title="wikilink">South Atlantic Anomaly</a>. The station's crews were exposed to an <a href="absorbed_dose" title="wikilink">absorbed dose</a> of about 5.2 <a href="Gray_(unit)" title="wikilink">cGy</a> over the course of a <a href="Mir_EO-18" title="wikilink">115-day expedition</a>, producing an <a href="equivalent_dose" title="wikilink">equivalent dose</a> of 14.75 <a href="Sievert" title="wikilink">cSv</a>, or 1133 µSv per day.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn194" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn195" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> This daily dose is approximately half of that received from natural <a href="background_radiation" title="wikilink">background radiation</a> on Earth in a year.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn196" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> The radiation environment of the station was not uniform, however; closer proximity to the station's hull led to an increased radiation dose, and the strength of radiation shielding varied between modules; <em>Kvant</em>-2's being better than the core module, for instance.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn197" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a></p>
<p>The increased radiation levels result in a higher risk of crews developing cancer, and can cause damage to the <a href="chromosomal" title="wikilink">chromosomes</a> of <a class="uri" href="lymphocytes" title="wikilink">lymphocytes</a>. These cells are central to the <a href="immune_system" title="wikilink">immune system</a> and so any damage to them could contribute to the lowered <a href="immunity_(medical)" title="wikilink">immunity</a> experienced by cosmonauts. Over time, lowered immunity results in the spread of infection between crew members, especially in such confined areas. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of <a class="uri" href="cataracts" title="wikilink">cataracts</a> in cosmonauts. Protective shielding and protective drugs may lower the risks to an acceptable level, but data is scarce and longer-term exposure will result in greater risks.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn198" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a></p>
<p>At the low altitudes at which <em>Mir</em> orbited there is a variety of <a href="space_debris" title="wikilink">space debris</a>, consisting of everything from entire spent <a href="rocket_stage" title="wikilink">rocket stages</a> and defunct <a href="satellite" title="wikilink">satellites</a>, to explosion fragments, paint flakes, slag from solid rocket motors, coolant released by <a class="uri" href="RORSAT" title="wikilink">RORSAT</a> nuclear powered satellites, <a href="Project_West_Ford" title="wikilink">small needles</a>, and many other objects.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn199" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> These objects, in addition to natural <a href="micrometeoroid" title="wikilink">micrometeoroids</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn200" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> posed a threat to the station as they have the ability to puncture pressurised modules and cause damage to other parts of the station, such as the solar arrays.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn201" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> Micrometeoroids also posed a risk to <a href="Extra-vehicular_activity" title="wikilink">spacewalking</a> cosmonauts, as such objects could <a href="Space_exposure" title="wikilink">puncture their spacesuits</a>, causing them to depressurise.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn202" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> Meteor showers in particular posed a significant risk to the station, and, during such storms, the crews slept in their Soyuz ferries to facilitate an emergency evacuation should <em>Mir</em> be damaged.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn203" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> </p>
