<p><strong>Stevens' power law</strong> is a proposed relationship between the <a href="magnitude_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">magnitude</a> of a physical stimulus and its perceived intensity or strength. It is often considered to supersede the <a href="Weber–Fechner_law" title="wikilink">Weber–Fechner law</a> on the basis that it describes a wider range of sensations, although critics argue that the validity of the law is contingent on the virtue of approaches to the <a class="uri" href="measurement" title="wikilink">measurement</a> of perceived intensity that are employed in relevant experiments. In addition, a distinction has been made between (i) local <a class="uri" href="psychophysics" title="wikilink">psychophysics</a>, where stimuli are discriminated only with a certain probability, and (ii) global psychophysics, where the stimuli would be discriminated correctly with near certainty (<a href="R._Duncan_Luce" title="wikilink">Luce</a> &amp; Krumhansl, 1988). The Weber–Fechner law and methods described by <a href="L.L._Thurstone" title="wikilink">L.L. Thurstone</a> are generally applied in local psychophysics, whereas Stevens' methods are usually applied in global psychophysics.</p>

<p>The theory is named after psychophysicist <a href="Stanley_Smith_Stevens" title="wikilink">Stanley Smith Stevens</a> (1906–1973). Although the idea of a <a href="power_law" title="wikilink">power law</a> had been suggested by 19th-century researchers, Stevens is credited with reviving the law and publishing a body of psychophysical data to support it in 1957.</p>

 is the magnitude of the physical stimulus, ψ(<em>I</em>) is the subjective magnitude of the sensation evoked by the stimulus, <em>a</em> is an exponent that depends on the type of stimulation and <em>k</em> is a <a href="proportionality_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">proportionality</a> constant that depends on the units used.</p>

<p>The table to the right lists the exponents reported by Stevens.</p>
<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>

<p>The principal methods used by Stevens to measure the perceived intensity of a stimulus were <em>magnitude estimation</em> and <em>magnitude production</em>. In magnitude estimation with a standard, the experimenter presents a stimulus called a <em>standard</em> and assigns it a number called the <em>modulus</em>. For subsequent stimuli, subjects report numerically their perceived intensity relative to the standard so as to preserve the ratio between the sensations and the numerical estimates (e.g., a sound perceived twice as loud as the standard should be given a number twice the modulus). In magnitude estimation without a standard (usually just <em>magnitude estimation</em>), subjects are free to choose their own standard, assigning any number to the first stimulus and all subsequent ones with the only requirement being that the ratio between sensations and numbers is preserved. In magnitude production a number and a reference stimulus is given and subjects produce a stimulus that is perceived as that number times the reference. Also used is <em>cross-modality matching</em>, which generally involves subjects altering the magnitude of one physical quantity, such as the brightness of a light, so that its perceived intensity is equal to the perceived intensity of another type of quantity, such as warmth or pressure.</p>
<h2 id="criticisms">Criticisms</h2>

<p>Stevens generally collected magnitude estimation data from multiple observers, averaged the data across subjects, and then fitted a power function to the data. Because the fit was generally reasonable, he concluded the power law was correct. This approach ignores any individual differences that may obtain and indeed it has been reported that the power relationship does not always hold as well when data are considered separately for individual respondents .</p>

<p>Another issue is that the approach provides neither a direct test of the power law itself nor the underlying assumptions of the magnitude estimation/production method.</p>

<p>Stevens' main assertion was that using magnitude estimations/productions respondents were able to make judgements on a <a href="Scale_(ratio)" title="wikilink">ratio scale</a> (i.e., if <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are values on a given ratio scale, then there exists a constant <em>k</em> such that <em>x</em> = <em>ky</em>). In the context of <a href="axiomatic_system" title="wikilink">axiomatic</a> psychophysics,  formulated a testable property capturing the implicit underlying assumption this assertion entailed. Specifically, for two proportions <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, and three stimuli, <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>z</em>, if <em>y</em> is judged <em>p</em> times <em>x</em>, <em>z</em> is judged <em>q</em> times <em>y</em>, then <em>t</em> = <em>pq</em> times <em>x</em> should be equal to <em>z</em>. This amounts to assuming that respondents interpret numbers in a veridical way. This property was unambiguously rejected . Without assuming veridical interpretation of numbers,  formulated another property that, if sustained, meant that respondents could make ratio scaled judgments, namely, if <em>y</em> is judged <em>p</em> times <em>x</em>, <em>z</em> is judged <em>q</em> times <em>y</em>, and if <em>y</em>{{'}} is judged <em>q</em> times <em>x</em>, <em>z</em>{{'}} is judged <em>p</em> times <em>y</em>{{'}}, then <em>z</em> should equal <em>z</em>{{'}}. This property has been sustained in a variety of situations .</p>

<p>Because Stevens fit power functions to data, his method did not provide a direct test of the power law itself. , under the condition that respondents' numerical distortion function and the psychophysical functions could be separated, formulated a behavioral condition equivalent to the psychophysical function being a power function. This condition was confirmed for just over half the respondents and the power form was found to be a reasonable approximation for the rest .</p>

<p>It has also been questioned, particularly in terms of <a href="signal_detection_theory" title="wikilink">signal detection theory</a>, whether any given stimulus is actually associated with a particular and <em>absolute</em> perceived intensity; i.e. one that is independent of contextual factors and conditions. Consistent with this, Luce (1990, p. 73) observed that "by introducing contexts such as background noise in loudness judgements, the shape of the magnitude estimation functions certainly deviates sharply from a power function".</p>
