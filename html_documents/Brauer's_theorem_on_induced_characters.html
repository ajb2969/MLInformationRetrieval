<h1>Brauer's theorem on induced characters</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Brauer's theorem on induced characters</strong>, often known as Brauer's induction theorem, and named after <a href="Richard_Brauer" title="wikilink">Richard Brauer</a>, is a basic result in the branch of <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a> known as <a href="character_theory" title="wikilink">character theory</a>, which is, in turn, part of the <a href="representation_theory_of_a_finite_group" title="wikilink">representation theory of a finite group</a>. Let <em>G</em> be a <a href="finite_group" title="wikilink">finite group</a> and let Char(<em>G</em>) denote the subring of the ring of complex-valued <a href="class_function" title="wikilink">class functions</a> of <em>G</em> consisting of integer combinations of <a href="Character_theory" title="wikilink">irreducible characters</a>. Char(<em>G</em>) is known as the <strong>character ring</strong> of <em>G</em>, and its elements are known as <strong>virtual characters</strong> (alternatively, as <strong>generalized characters</strong>, or sometimes <strong>difference characters</strong>). It is a ring by virtue of the fact that the product of characters of <em>G</em> is again a character of <em>G.</em> Its multiplication is given by the elementwise product of class functions.</p>

<p>Brauer's induction theorem shows that the character ring can be generated (as an <a href="abelian_group" title="wikilink">abelian group</a>) by <a href="Character_theory" title="wikilink">induced characters</a> of the form

, where <em>H</em> ranges over <a href="subgroup" title="wikilink">subgroups</a> of <em>G</em> and λ ranges over <a href="Character_theory" title="wikilink">linear characters</a> (having degree 1) of <em>H</em>.</p>

<p>In fact, Brauer showed that the subgroups <em>H</em> could be chosen from a very restricted collection, now called <a href="elementary_group" title="wikilink"><strong>Brauer elementary</strong> subgroups</a>. These are direct products of cyclic groups and groups whose order is a power of a prime.</p>

<p>Using <a href="Character_theory" title="wikilink">Frobenius reciprocity</a>, Brauer's induction theorem leads easily to his fundamental <strong>characterization of characters</strong>, which asserts that a complex-valued class function of <em>G</em> is a virtual character if and only if its restriction to each Brauer elementary subgroup of <em>G</em> is a virtual character. This result, together with the fact that a virtual character θ is an irreducible character if and only if θ(1) <em>&gt; 0</em> and

 is the usual <a href="Class_function#Inner_products" title="wikilink">inner product on the ring of complex-valued class functions</a>) gives a means of constructing irreducible characters without explicitly constructing the associated representations.</p>

<p>An initial motivation for Brauer's induction theorem was application to <a href="Artin_L-function" title="wikilink">Artin L-functions</a>. It shows that those are built up from <a href="Dirichlet_L-function" title="wikilink">Dirichlet L-functions</a>, or more general <a href="Hecke_character" title="wikilink">Hecke L-functions</a>. Highly significant for that application is whether each character of <em>G</em> is a <em>non-negative</em> integer combination of characters induced from linear characters of subgroups. In general, this is not the case. In fact, by a theorem of Taketa, if all characters of <em>G</em> are so expressible, then <em>G</em> must be a <a href="group_theory" title="wikilink">solvable group</a> (although solvability alone does not guarantee such expressions- for example, the solvable group <em>SL(2,3)</em> has an irreducible complex character of degree 2 which is not expressible as a non-negative integer combination of characters induced from linear characters of subgroups). An ingredient of the proof of Brauer's induction theorem is that when <em>G</em> is a finite <a href="nilpotent_group" title="wikilink">nilpotent group</a>, every complex irreducible character of <em>G</em> is induced from a linear character of some subgroup.</p>

<p>A precursor to Brauer's induction theorem was <a href="Emil_Artin" title="wikilink">Artin</a>'s induction theorem, which states that |<em>G</em>| times the trivial character of <em>G</em> is an integer combination of characters which are each induced from trivial characters of cyclic subgroups of <em>G.</em> Brauer's theorem removes the factor |<em>G</em>|, but at the expense of expanding the collection of subgroups used. Some years after the proof of Brauer's theorem appeared, <a href="James_Alexander_Green" title="wikilink">J.A. Green</a> showed (in 1955) that no such induction theorem (with integer combinations of characters induced from linear characters) could be proved with a collection of subgroups smaller than the Brauer elementary subgroups.</p>

<p>The proof of Brauer's induction theorem exploits the ring structure of Char(<em>G</em>) (most proofs also make use of a slightly larger ring, Char*(G), which consists of

-combinations of irreducible characters, where ω is a primitive complex |<em>G</em>|-th root of unity). The set of integer combinations of characters induced from linear characters of Brauer elementary subgroups is an ideal <em>I</em>(<em>G</em>) of Char(<em>G</em>), so the proof reduces to showing that the trivial character is in <em>I</em>(<em>G</em>). Several proofs of the theorem, beginning with a proof due to Brauer and <a href="John_Tate" title="wikilink">John Tate</a>, show that the trivial character is in the analogously defined ideal <em>I</em>*(<em>G</em>) of Char*(<em>G</em>) by concentrating attention on one prime <em>p</em> at a time, and constructing integer-valued elements of <em>I</em>*(<em>G</em>) which differ (elementwise) from the trivial character by (integer multiples of) a sufficiently high power of <em>p.</em> Once this is achieved for every prime divisor of |<em>G</em>|, some manipulations with congruences and <a href="algebraic_integer" title="wikilink">algebraic integers</a>, again exploiting the fact that <em>I</em>*(<em>G</em>) is an ideal of Ch*(<em>G</em>), place the trivial character in <em>I</em>(<em>G</em>). An auxiliary result here is that a

) by |<em>G</em>|.</p>

<p>Brauer's induction theorem was proved in 1946, and there are now many alternative proofs. In 1986, Victor Snaith gave a proof by a radically different approach, topological in nature (an application of the <a href="Lefschetz_fixed-point_theorem" title="wikilink">Lefschetz fixed-point theorem</a>). There has been related recent work on the question of finding natural and explicit forms of Brauer's theorem, notably by <a href="Robert_Boltje" title="wikilink">Robert Boltje</a>.</p>
