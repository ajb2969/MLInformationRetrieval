<h1>Hammer</h1>
<hr/>

<p>A <strong>hammer</strong> is a <a class="uri" href="tool" title="wikilink">tool</a> with a heavy head and a handle (often made of shock-absorbent wood or fiberglass) that is used to strike an object. The most common uses for hammers are to drive <a href="nail_(fastener)" title="wikilink">nails</a>, fit parts, <a class="uri" href="forge" title="wikilink">forge</a> metal, and break apart objects. Hammers vary in shape, size, and structure, depending on their uses.</p>

<p>Hammers are basic tools in many <a href="tradesman" title="wikilink">trades</a>. A hammer is composed of a head (most often made of <a class="uri" href="steel" title="wikilink">steel</a>) and a handle (also called a <a href="wikt:helve#Noun" title="wikilink">helve</a> or <a href="wikt:haft#Noun" title="wikilink">haft</a>). Most hammers are <a href="hand_tool" title="wikilink">hand tools</a>, but there are also many powered versions—<a href="power_hammer" title="wikilink">power hammers</a> (also called <a href="steam_hammer" title="wikilink">steam hammers</a> or <a href="trip_hammer" title="wikilink">trip hammers</a>, depending on design)—for heavier uses.</p>

<p>Some hammers have other names, such as <em><a class="uri" href="mallet" title="wikilink">mallet</a></em> and <em><a class="uri" href="gavel" title="wikilink">gavel</a></em>. The term "hammer" also applies to some other devices that strike an object, such as the small <a href="hammer_(firearm)" title="wikilink">hammer of a firearm</a> or the felt hammer of a <a class="uri" href="piano" title="wikilink">piano</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The use of simple hammers dates to about 2,600,000 <a class="uri" href="BCE" title="wikilink">BCE</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> when various shaped stones were used to strike <a class="uri" href="wood" title="wikilink">wood</a>, <a class="uri" href="bone" title="wikilink">bone</a>, or other stones to break them apart and shape them. Stones attached to sticks with strips of leather or animal sinew were being used as hammers with handles by about 30,000 BCE during the middle of the <a href="Paleolithic" title="wikilink">Paleolithic Stone Age</a>.</p>

<p>The hammer's archeological record shows that it may be the oldest tool for which definite evidence exists of its early existence.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="construction-and-materials">Construction and materials</h2>

<p>A traditional hand-held hammer consists of a separate head and a handle, fastened together by means of a special wedge made for the purpose, or by glue, or both. This two-piece design is often used, to combine a dense metallic striking head with a non-metallic mechanical-shock-absorbing handle (to reduce user fatigue from repeated strikes). If wood is used for the handle, it is often <a class="uri" href="hickory" title="wikilink">hickory</a> or <a href="ash_(tree)" title="wikilink">ash</a>, which are tough and long-lasting materials that can dissipate <a href="shock_wave" title="wikilink">shock waves</a> from the hammer head. Rigid <a href="fiberglass" title="wikilink">fiberglass resin</a> may be used for the handle; this material does not absorb water or decay, but does not dissipate shock as well as wood.</p>

<p>A loose hammer head is hazardous because it can literally "fly off the handle" when in use, becoming a dangerous uncontrolled missile. Wooden handles can often be replaced when worn or damaged; special kits are available covering a range of handle sizes and designs, plus special wedges for attachment.</p>

<p>Some hammers are one-piece designs made primarily of a single material. A one-piece metallic hammer may optionally have its handle coated or wrapped in a resilient material such as rubber, for improved grip and reduced user fatigue.</p>

<p>The hammer head may be surfaced with a variety of materials, including <a class="uri" href="brass" title="wikilink">brass</a>, <a class="uri" href="bronze" title="wikilink">bronze</a>, wood, plastic, rubber, or leather. Some hammers have interchangeable striking surfaces, which can be selected as needed or replaced when worn out.</p>
<h2 id="designs-and-variations">Designs and variations</h2>

<p>  A large hammer-like tool is a <em>maul</em> (commander, beetle), a wood or rubber headed hammer is a <em><a class="uri" href="mallet" title="wikilink">mallet</a></em>, and a hammer-like tool with a cutting blade is usually called a <em><a class="uri" href="hatchet" title="wikilink">hatchet</a></em>. The essential part of a hammer is the head, a compact solid mass that is able to deliver the blow to the intended target without itself deforming. The opposite side may have a ball shape, as in the <a href="ball-peen_hammer" title="wikilink">ball-peen hammer</a>. Some <a href="upholstery_hammer" title="wikilink">upholstery hammers</a> have a <a href="magnet" title="wikilink">magnetized</a> face, to pick up tacks. In the <a class="uri" href="hatchet" title="wikilink">hatchet</a>, the hammer head is secondary to the cutting edge of the tool.</p>

<p>The impact between steel hammer heads and the objects being hit can create sparks, which may ignite <a class="uri" href="flammable" title="wikilink">flammable</a> or explosive gases. These are a hazard in some industries such as <a href="underground_coal_mining" title="wikilink">underground coal mining</a> (<a class="uri" href="methane" title="wikilink">methane</a> gas), or in other hazardous environments such as <a href="petroleum_refineries" title="wikilink">petroleum refineries</a> and chemical plants. In these environments, a variety of non-sparking metal tools are used, primarily <a class="uri" href="aluminium" title="wikilink">aluminium</a> or <a href="beryllium_copper" title="wikilink">beryllium copper</a> hammers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In recent years, the handles have been made of durable plastic or rubber, though wood is still widely used.</p>

<h3 id="hammer-as-a-force-amplifier">Hammer as a force amplifier</h3>

<p>A hammer is basically a <a class="uri" href="force" title="wikilink">force</a> <a class="uri" href="amplifier" title="wikilink">amplifier</a> that works by converting <a href="mechanical_work" title="wikilink">mechanical work</a> into <a href="kinetic_energy" title="wikilink">kinetic energy</a> and back.</p>

<p>In the swing that precedes each blow, the hammer head stores a certain amount of kinetic energy—equal to the length <em>D</em> of the swing times the force <em>f</em> produced by the <a href="muscle" title="wikilink">muscles</a> of the arm and by <a class="uri" href="gravity" title="wikilink">gravity</a>. When the hammer strikes, the head is stopped by an opposite force coming from the target, equal and opposite to the force applied by the head to the target. If the target is a hard and heavy object, or if it is resting on some sort of <a class="uri" href="anvil" title="wikilink">anvil</a>, the head can travel only a very short distance <em>d</em> before stopping. Since the stopping force <em>F</em> times that distance must be equal to the head's kinetic energy, it follows that <em>F</em> is much greater than the original driving force <em>f</em>—roughly, by a factor <em>D</em>/<em>d</em>. In this way, great strength is not needed to produce a force strong enough to bend steel, or crack the hardest stone.</p>
<h3 id="effect-of-the-heads-mass">Effect of the head's mass</h3>

<p>The amount of energy delivered to the target by the hammer-blow is equivalent to one half the mass of the head times the square of the head's speed at the time of impact (

). While the energy delivered to the target increases linearly with mass, it increases quadratically with the <a class="uri" href="speed" title="wikilink">speed</a> (see the effect of the handle, below). High tech <a class="uri" href="titanium" title="wikilink">titanium</a> heads are lighter and allow for longer handles, thus increasing velocity and delivering more energy with less arm fatigue than that of a steel head hammer of the same weight.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>As hammers must be used in many circumstances, where the position of the person using them cannot be taken for granted, trade-offs are made for the sake of practicality. In areas where one has plenty of room, a long handle with a heavy head (like a sledge hammer) can deliver the maximum amount of energy to the target. It is not practical to use such a large hammer for all tasks, however, and thus the overall design has been modified repeatedly to achieve the optimum utility in a wide variety of situations.</p>
<h3 id="effect-of-the-handle">Effect of the handle</h3>

<p>The handle of the hammer helps in several ways. It keeps the user's hands away from the point of impact. It provides a broad area that is better-suited for gripping by the hand. Most importantly, it allows the user to maximize the speed of the head on each blow. The primary constraint on additional handle length is the lack of space to swing the hammer. This is why sledge hammers, largely used in open spaces, can have handles that are much longer than a standard carpenter's hammer. The second most important constraint is more subtle. Even without considering the effects of fatigue, the longer the handle, the harder it is to guide the head of the hammer to its target at full speed.</p>

<p>Most designs are a compromise between practicality and energy efficiency. With too long a handle, the hammer is inefficient because it delivers force to the wrong place, off-target. With too short a handle, the hammer is inefficient because it doesn't deliver enough force, requiring more blows to complete a given task.</p>

<p>Modifications have also been made with respect to the effect of the hammer on the user. A titanium head has about 3% recoil and can result in greater efficiency and less fatigue when compared to a steel head with up to 30% recoil.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Handles made of shock-absorbing materials or varying angles attempt to make it easier for the user to continue to wield this age-old device, even as nail guns and other powered drivers encroach on its traditional field of use.</p>
<h3 id="effect-of-gravity">Effect of gravity</h3>

<p>Gravity exerts a force on the hammer head. If hammering downwards, gravity increases the acceleration during the hammer stroke and increases the energy delivered with each blow. If hammering upwards, gravity reduces the acceleration during the hammer stroke and therefore reduces the energy delivered with each blow. Some hammering methods, such as pile drivers, rely entirely on gravity for acceleration on the down stroke.</p>
<h2 id="ergonomics-and-injury-risks">Ergonomics and injury risks</h2>

<p>Both manual and powered hammers can cause <a href="peripheral_neuropathy" title="wikilink">peripheral neuropathy</a> or a variety of other ailments when used improperly. Awkward handles can cause <a href="repetitive_stress_injury" title="wikilink">repetitive stress injury</a> (RSI) to hand and arm joints, and uncontrolled shock waves from repeated impacts can injure nerves and the skeleton.</p>

<h2 id="symbolic-hammers">Symbolic hammers</h2>

<p>The hammer, being one of the most used tools by <em><a href="Homo_sapiens" title="wikilink">Homo sapiens</a></em>, has been used very much in symbols such as <a href="flag" title="wikilink">flags</a> and <a class="uri" href="heraldry" title="wikilink">heraldry</a>. In the Middle Ages, it was used often in blacksmith guild logos, as well as in many family symbols. The <a href="hammer_and_pick" title="wikilink">hammer and pick</a> is used as a symbol of mining.</p>

<p>A well known symbol with a hammer in it is the <a href="Hammer_and_Sickle" title="wikilink">Hammer and Sickle</a>, which was the symbol of the former <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> and is very interlinked with <a class="uri" href="communism" title="wikilink">communism</a> and early <a class="uri" href="socialism" title="wikilink">socialism</a>. The hammer in this symbol represents the industrial working class (and the sickle represents the agricultural working class). The hammer is used in some coat of arms in (former) socialist countries like <a href="East_Germany" title="wikilink">East Germany</a>. Similarly, the Hammer and Sword symbolizes <a class="uri" href="Strasserism" title="wikilink">Strasserism</a>, a strand of <a href="Nazism" title="wikilink">National Socialism</a> seeking to appeal to the working class.</p>

<p>The <a class="uri" href="gavel" title="wikilink">gavel</a>, a small wooden mallet, is used to symbolize a mandate to preside over a meeting or judicial proceeding, and a graphic image of one is used as a symbol of legislative or judicial decision-making authority.</p>

<p>In <a href="Norse_mythology" title="wikilink">Norse mythology</a>, <a class="uri" href="Thor" title="wikilink">Thor</a>, the god of thunder and lightning, wields a hammer named <a class="uri" href="Mjölnir" title="wikilink">Mjölnir</a>.
