<h1>Schrödinger's cat</h1>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Schrödinger's cat</strong> is a <a href="thought_experiment" title="wikilink">thought experiment</a>, sometimes described as a <a class="uri" href="paradox" title="wikilink">paradox</a>, devised by Austrian physicist <a href="Erwin_Schrödinger" title="wikilink">Erwin Schrödinger</a> in 1935.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It illustrates what he saw as the problem of the <a href="Copenhagen_interpretation" title="wikilink">Copenhagen interpretation</a> of <a href="quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">quantum mechanics</a> applied to everyday objects. The scenario presents a cat which may be simultaneously both alive and dead,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> a state known as a <a href="quantum_superposition" title="wikilink">quantum superposition</a>, as a result of being linked to a random <a href="Subatomic_particle" title="wikilink">subatomic</a> event that may or may not occur. The thought experiment is also often featured in theoretical discussions of the <a href="interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">interpretations of quantum mechanics</a>. Schrödinger coined the term <em>Verschränkung</em> (<a href="Quantum_entanglement" title="wikilink">entanglement</a>) in the course of developing the thought experiment.</p>
<h2 id="origin-and-motivation">Origin and motivation</h2>
<p>Schrödinger intended his thought experiment as a discussion of the <a href="EPR_paradox" title="wikilink">EPR article</a>—named after its authors <a class="uri" href="Einstein" title="wikilink">Einstein</a>, <a href="Boris_Podolsky" title="wikilink">Podolsky</a>, and <a href="Nathan_Rosen" title="wikilink">Rosen</a>—in 1935.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The EPR article highlighted the strange nature of <a href="quantum_superpositions" title="wikilink">quantum superpositions</a>, in which a quantum system such as an <a class="uri" href="atom" title="wikilink">atom</a> or <a class="uri" href="photon" title="wikilink">photon</a> can exist as a combination of multiple states corresponding to different possible outcomes. The prevailing theory, called the <a href="Copenhagen_interpretation" title="wikilink">Copenhagen interpretation</a>, said that a quantum system remained in this superposition until it interacted with, or was <a href="observation" title="wikilink">observed</a> by, the external world, at which time the superposition <a href="wave_function_collapse" title="wikilink">collapses</a> into one or another of the possible definite states. The EPR experiment showed that a system with multiple particles separated by large distances could be in such a superposition. Schrödinger and Einstein exchanged letters about Einstein's EPR article, in the course of which Einstein pointed out that the state of an <a href="Instability" title="wikilink">unstable</a> keg of <a class="uri" href="gunpowder" title="wikilink">gunpowder</a> will, after a while, contain a <a href="quantum_superposition" title="wikilink">superposition</a> of both exploded and unexploded states.</p>
<p>To further illustrate, Schrödinger described how one could, in principle, create a superposition in a large-scale system by making it dependent on a quantum particle that was in a superposition. He proposed a scenario with a cat in a sealed box, wherein the cat's life or death depended on the state of a <a class="uri" href="radioactive" title="wikilink">radioactive</a> atom, whether it had decayed and emitted radiation or not. According to Schrödinger, the Copenhagen interpretation implies that <em>the cat remains both alive and dead</em> until the box is opened. Schrödinger did not wish to promote the idea of dead-and-alive cats as a serious possibility; on the contrary, he intended the example to illustrate the absurdity of the existing view of quantum mechanics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> However, since Schrödinger's time, other <a href="interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">interpretations</a> of the mathematics of quantum mechanics have been advanced by physicists, some of which regard the "alive and dead" cat superposition as quite real. Intended as a critique of the <a href="Copenhagen_interpretation" title="wikilink">Copenhagen interpretation</a> (the prevailing <a class="uri" href="orthodoxy" title="wikilink">orthodoxy</a> in 1935), the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment remains a defining <a href="touchstone_(metaphor)" title="wikilink">touchstone</a> for modern <a href="interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">interpretations of quantum mechanics</a>. Physicists often use the way each interpretation deals with Schrödinger's cat as a way of illustrating and comparing the particular features, strengths, and weaknesses of each interpretation.</p>
<h2 id="the-thought-experiment">The thought experiment</h2>
<p>Schrödinger wrote:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> <mtpl></mtpl></p>
<p>Schrödinger's famous <a href="thought_experiment" title="wikilink">thought experiment</a> poses the question, "<em>when</em> does a quantum system stop existing as a <a href="Quantum_superposition" title="wikilink">superposition</a> of states and become one or the other?" (More technically, when does the actual quantum state stop being a <a href="linear_combination" title="wikilink">linear combination</a> of states, each of which resembles different classical states, and instead begin to have a unique classical description?) If the cat survives, it remembers only being alive. But explanations of the EPR experiments that are <a class="uri" href="consistent" title="wikilink">consistent</a> with standard microscopic quantum mechanics require that macroscopic objects, such as cats and notebooks, do not always have unique classical descriptions. The thought experiment illustrates this apparent paradox. Our intuition says that no observer can be in a mixture of states—yet the cat, it seems from the thought experiment, can be such a mixture. Is the cat required to be an observer, or does its existence in a single well-defined classical state require another external observer? Each alternative seemed absurd to Albert Einstein, who was impressed by the ability of the thought experiment to highlight these issues. In a letter to Schrödinger dated 1950, he wrote: <mtpl></mtpl> Note that the charge of gunpowder is not mentioned in Schrödinger's setup, which uses a Geiger counter as an <a href="quantum_decoherence" title="wikilink">amplifier</a> and hydrocyanic poison instead of gunpowder. The gunpowder had been mentioned in Einstein's original suggestion to Schrödinger 15 years before, and Einstein carried it forward to the present discussion.</p>
<h2 id="interpretations-of-the-experiment">Interpretations of the experiment</h2>
<p>Since Schrödinger's time, other <a href="interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">interpretations of quantum mechanics</a> have been proposed that give different answers to the questions posed by Schrödinger's cat of how long superpositions last and when (or <em>whether</em>) they collapse.</p>
<h3 id="copenhagen-interpretation">Copenhagen interpretation</h3>
<p>The most commonly held interpretation of quantum mechanics is the <a href="Copenhagen_interpretation" title="wikilink">Copenhagen interpretation</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In the Copenhagen interpretation, a system stops being a superposition of states and becomes either one or the other when an observation takes place. This thought experiment makes apparent the fact that the nature of <a href="Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">measurement</a>, or observation, is not well-defined in this interpretation. The experiment can be interpreted to mean that while the box is closed, the system simultaneously exists in a superposition of the states "decayed nucleus/dead cat" and "undecayed nucleus/living cat", and that only when the box is opened and an observation performed does the <a href="wave_function" title="wikilink">wave function</a> collapse into one of the two states.</p>
<p>However, one of the main scientists associated with the Copenhagen interpretation, <a href="Niels_Bohr" title="wikilink">Niels Bohr</a>, never had in mind the observer-induced collapse of the wave function, so that Schrödinger's cat did not pose any riddle to him. The cat would be either dead or alive long before the box is opened by a conscious observer.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Analysis of an actual experiment found that measurement alone (for example by a Geiger counter) is sufficient to collapse a quantum wave function before there is any conscious observation of the measurement.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The view that the "observation" is taken when a particle from the nucleus hits the detector can be developed into <a href="objective_collapse_theories" title="wikilink">objective collapse theories</a>. The thought experiment requires an "unconscious observation" by the detector in order for magnification to occur. In contrast, the <a href="many_worlds" title="wikilink">many worlds</a> approach denies that collapse ever occurs.</p>
<h3 id="many-worlds-interpretation-and-consistent-histories">Many-worlds interpretation and consistent histories</h3>
<p>  In 1957, <a href="Hugh_Everett" title="wikilink">Hugh Everett</a> formulated the <a href="many-worlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics</a>, which does not single out observation as a special process. In the many-worlds interpretation, both alive and dead states of the cat persist after the box is opened, but are <a href="quantum_decoherence" title="wikilink">decoherent</a> from each other. In other words, when the box is opened, the observer and the possibly-dead cat split into an observer looking at a box with a dead cat, and an observer looking at a box with a live cat. But since the dead and alive states are decoherent, there is no effective communication or interaction between them.</p>
<p>When opening the box, the observer becomes entangled with the cat, so "observer states" corresponding to the cat's being alive and dead are formed; each observer state is <a href="quantum_entanglement" title="wikilink">entangled or linked</a> with the cat so that the "observation of the cat's state" and the "cat's state" correspond with each other. <a href="Quantum_decoherence" title="wikilink">Quantum decoherence</a> ensures that the different outcomes have no interaction with each other. The same mechanism of quantum decoherence is also important for the interpretation in terms of <a href="consistent_histories" title="wikilink">consistent histories</a>. Only the "dead cat" or the "alive cat" can be a part of a consistent history in this interpretation.</p>
<p><a href="Roger_Penrose" title="wikilink">Roger Penrose</a> criticises this: <mtpl></mtpl> However, the mainstream view (without necessarily endorsing many-worlds) is that decoherence is the mechanism that forbids such simultaneous perception.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>A variant of the Schrödinger's cat experiment, known as the <a href="Quantum_suicide_and_immortality" title="wikilink">quantum suicide</a> machine, has been proposed by cosmologist <a href="Max_Tegmark" title="wikilink">Max Tegmark</a>. It examines the Schrödinger's cat experiment from the point of view of the cat, and argues that by using this approach, one may be able to distinguish between the Copenhagen interpretation and many-worlds.</p>
<h3 id="ensemble-interpretation">Ensemble interpretation</h3>
<p>The <a href="Ensemble_Interpretation" title="wikilink">ensemble interpretation</a> states that superpositions are nothing but subensembles of a larger statistical ensemble. The state vector would not apply to individual cat experiments, but only to the statistics of many similarly prepared cat experiments. Proponents of this interpretation state that this makes the Schrödinger's cat paradox a trivial matter, or a non-issue.</p>
<p>This interpretation serves to <em>discard</em> the idea that a single physical system in quantum mechanics has a mathematical description that corresponds to it in any way.</p>
<h3 id="relational-interpretation">Relational interpretation</h3>
<p>The <a href="Relational_quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">relational interpretation</a> makes no fundamental distinction between the human experimenter, the cat, or the apparatus, or between animate and inanimate systems; all are quantum systems governed by the same rules of wavefunction <a href="Time_evolution" title="wikilink">evolution</a>, and all may be considered "observers". But the relational interpretation allows that different observers can give different accounts of the same series of events, depending on the information they have about the system.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The cat can be considered an observer of the apparatus; meanwhile, the experimenter can be considered another observer of the system in the box (the cat plus the apparatus). Before the box is opened, the cat, by nature of its being alive or dead, has information about the state of the apparatus (the atom has either decayed or not decayed); but the experimenter does not have information about the state of the box contents. In this way, the two observers simultaneously have different accounts of the situation: To the cat, the wavefunction of the apparatus has appeared to "collapse"; to the experimenter, the contents of the box appear to be in superposition. Not until the box is opened, and both observers have the same information about what happened, do both system states appear to "collapse" into the same definite result, a cat that is either alive or dead.</p>
<h3 id="objective-collapse-theories">Objective collapse theories</h3>
<p>According to <a href="objective_collapse_theories" title="wikilink">objective collapse theories</a>, superpositions are destroyed spontaneously (irrespective of external observation) when some objective physical threshold (of <a class="uri" href="time" title="wikilink">time</a>, <a class="uri" href="mass" title="wikilink">mass</a>, <a class="uri" href="temperature" title="wikilink">temperature</a>, <a class="uri" href="irreversibility" title="wikilink">irreversibility</a>, etc.) is reached. Thus, the cat would be expected to have settled into a definite state long before the box is opened. This could loosely be phrased as "the cat observes itself", or "the environment observes the cat".</p>
<p>Objective collapse theories require a modification of standard quantum mechanics to allow superpositions to be destroyed by the process of time evolution. This process, known as "<a href="Quantum_decoherence" title="wikilink">decoherence</a>", is among the fastest processes currently known to physics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>The experiment as described is a purely theoretical one, and the machine proposed is not known to have been constructed. However, successful experiments involving similar principles, e.g. superpositions of <a href="mesoscopic" title="wikilink">relatively large</a> (by the standards of quantum physics) objects have been performed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> These experiments do not show that a cat-sized object can be superposed, but the known upper limit on "cat states" has been pushed upwards by them. In many cases the state is short-lived, even when cooled to near <a href="absolute_zero" title="wikilink">absolute zero</a>.</p>

<li>An experiment involving a <a href="superconducting_quantum_interference_device" title="wikilink">superconducting quantum interference device</a> ("SQUID") has been linked to the theme of the thought experiment: "The superposition state does not correspond to a billion electrons flowing one way and a billion others flowing the other way. Superconducting electrons move en masse.

<p><a href="Wigner's_friend" title="wikilink">Wigner's friend</a> is a variant on the experiment with two human observers: the first makes an observation on whether a flash of light is seen and then communicates his observation to a second observer.

<p>In another extension, prominent physicists have gone so far as to suggest that astronomers observing <a href="dark_energy" title="wikilink">dark energy</a> in the universe in 1998 may have "reduced its life expectancy" through a pseudo-Schrödinger's cat scenario, although this is a controversial viewpoint.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
