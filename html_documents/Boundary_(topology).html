<h1>Boundary (topology)</h1>
<hr/>

<p> In <a class="uri" href="topology" title="wikilink">topology</a> and <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a> in general, the <strong>boundary</strong> of a subset <em>S</em> of a <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topological space</a> <em>X</em> is the set of points which can be approached both from <em>S</em> and from the outside of <em>S</em>. More precisely, it is the set of points in the <a href="closure_(topology)" title="wikilink">closure</a> of <em>S</em>, not belonging to the <a href="interior_(topology)" title="wikilink">interior</a> of <em>S</em>. An element of the boundary of <em>S</em> is called a <strong>boundary point</strong> of <em>S</em>. The term <strong>boundary operation</strong> refers to finding or taking the boundary of a set. Notations used for boundary of a set <em>S</em> include bd(<em>S</em>), fr(<em>S</em>), and <a class="uri" href="∂" title="wikilink">∂</a><em>S</em>. Some authors (for example Willard, in <em>General Topology</em>) use the term <strong>frontier</strong>, instead of boundary in an attempt to avoid confusion with the concept of boundary used in <a href="algebraic_topology" title="wikilink">algebraic topology</a> and <a href="manifold_theory" title="wikilink">manifold theory</a>. However, frontier sometimes refers to a different set, which is the set of boundary points which are not actually in the set; that is, <span style="text-decoration: overline"><em>S</em></span> \ <em>S</em>.</p>

<p>A <a href="Connected_space#Formal_definition" title="wikilink">connected component</a> of the boundary of <em>S</em> is called a <strong>boundary component</strong> of <em>S</em>.</p>
<h2 id="common-definitions">Common definitions</h2>

<p>There are several common (and equivalent) definitions to the boundary of a subset <em>S</em> of a topological space <em>X</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>the closure of <em>S</em> without the interior of <em>S</em>: ∂<em>S</em> = <span style="text-decoration: overline"><em>S</em></span> \ <em>S</em><sup>o</sup>.</li>
<li>the intersection of the closure of <em>S</em> with the closure of its <a href="complement_(set_theory)" title="wikilink">complement</a>: ∂<em>S</em> = <span style="text-decoration: overline"><em>S</em></span> ∩ <span style="text-decoration: overline">(<em>X</em> \ <em>S</em>)</span>.</li>
<li>the set of points <em>p</em> of <em>X</em> such that every <a href="neighborhood_(topology)" title="wikilink">neighborhood</a> of <em>p</em> contains at least one point of <em>S</em> and at least one point not of <em>S</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p> Consider the real line <strong>R</strong> with the usual topology (i.e. the topology whose <a href="basis_(topology)" title="wikilink">basis sets</a> are <a href="open_interval" title="wikilink">open intervals</a>). One has</p>
<ul>
<li>∂(0,5) = ∂[0,5) = ∂(0,5] = ∂[0,5] = {0,5}</li>
<li>∂∅ = ∅</li>
<li>∂<strong>Q</strong> = <strong>R</strong></li>
<li>∂(<strong>Q</strong> ∩ [0,1]) = [0,1]</li>
</ul>

<p>These last two examples illustrate the fact that the boundary of a <a href="dense_set" title="wikilink">dense set</a> with empty interior is its closure.</p>

<p>In the space of rational numbers with the usual topology (the <a href="subspace_topology" title="wikilink">subspace topology</a> of <strong>R</strong>), the boundary of

, where <em>a</em> is irrational, is empty.</p>

<p>The boundary of a set is a <a href="topology" title="wikilink">topological</a> notion and may change if one changes the topology. For example, given the usual topology on <strong>R</strong><sup>2</sup>, the boundary of a closed disk Ω = {(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) | <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>y</em><sup>2</sup> ≤ 1} is the disk's surrounding circle: ∂Ω = {(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) | <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>y</em><sup>2</sup> = 1}. If the disk is viewed as a set in <strong>R</strong><sup>3</sup> with its own usual topology, i.e. Ω = {(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,0) | <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>y</em><sup>2</sup> ≤ 1}, then the boundary of the disk is the disk itself: ∂Ω = Ω. If the disk is viewed as its own topological space (with the subspace topology of <strong>R</strong><sup>2</sup>), then the boundary of the disk is empty.</p>
<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>
<ul>
<li>The boundary of a set is <a href="closed_set" title="wikilink">closed</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li>The boundary of the interior of a set as well as the boundary of the closure of a set are both contained in the boundary of the set.</li>
<li>A set is the boundary of some open set if and only if it is closed and <a href="nowhere_dense" title="wikilink">nowhere dense</a>.</li>
<li>The boundary of a set is the boundary of the complement of the set: ∂<em>S</em> = ∂(<em>S<sup>C</sup></em>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Hence:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>p</em> is a boundary point of a set if and only if every neighborhood of <em>p</em> contains at least one point in the set and at least one point not in the set.</li>
<li>A set is closed if and only if it contains its boundary, and <a href="open_set" title="wikilink">open</a> if and only if it is disjoint from its boundary.</li>
<li>The closure of a set equals the union of the set with its boundary. <span style="text-decoration:overline"><em>S</em></span> = <em>S</em> ∪ ∂<em>S</em>.</li>
<li>The boundary of a set is empty if and only if the set is both closed and open (that is, a <a href="clopen_set" title="wikilink">clopen set</a>).</li>

<h2 id="boundary-of-a-boundary">Boundary of a boundary</h2>

<p>For any set <em>S</em>, ∂<em>S</em> ⊇ ∂∂<em>S</em>, with equality holding if and only if the boundary of <em>S</em> has no interior points, which will be the case for example if <em>S</em> is either closed or open. Since the boundary of a set is closed, ∂∂<em>S</em> = ∂∂∂<em>S</em> for any set <em>S</em>. The boundary operator thus satisfies a weakened kind of <a class="uri" href="idempotence" title="wikilink">idempotence</a>.</p>

<p>In discussing boundaries of <a href="manifold" title="wikilink">manifolds</a> or <a href="simplex" title="wikilink">simplexes</a> and their <a href="simplicial_complex" title="wikilink">simplicial complexes</a>, one often meets the assertion that the boundary of the boundary is always empty. Indeed, the construction of the <a href="singular_homology" title="wikilink">singular homology</a> rests critically on this fact. The explanation for the apparent incongruity is that the topological boundary (the subject of this article) is a slightly different concept than the boundary of a manifold or of a simplicial complex. For example, the boundary of an open disk viewed as a manifold is empty, while its boundary in the sense of topological space is the circle surrounding the disk.</p>
