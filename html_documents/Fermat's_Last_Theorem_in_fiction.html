<h1>Fermat's Last Theorem in fiction</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The famous problem in <a href="number_theory" title="wikilink">number theory</a> known as "<strong><a href="Fermat's_Last_Theorem" title="wikilink">Fermat's Last Theorem</a></strong>" has repeatedly received attention in <strong>fiction</strong> and popular culture.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <a href="Doctor_Who" title="wikilink">Doctor Who</a> episode "<a href="The_Eleventh_Hour_(Doctor_Who)" title="wikilink">The Eleventh Hour</a>", the Doctor transmits a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by typing it in just a few seconds on Jeff's laptop to prove his genius to a collection of world leaders discussing the latest threat to the human race. This implies that the Doctor knew a proof which was quite short and easy for others to comprehend.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="The_IT_Crowd" title="wikilink">The IT Crowd</a>, Series 3 Episode 6 "Calendar Geeks", Fermat's Last Theorem is referenced during a photoshoot for a calendar about geeks and achievements in Science and Mathematics.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In "<a href="The_Royale" title="wikilink">The Royale</a>", an episode (first aired 27 March 1989) of <em><a href="Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation" title="wikilink">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>, <a href="Jean-Luc_Picard" title="wikilink">Captain Picard</a> states that the theorem had gone unsolved for 800 years. At the end of the episode <a href="Jean-Luc_Picard" title="wikilink">Captain Picard</a> says, "Like Fermat's theorem, it is a puzzle we may never solve." Wiles' proof was released five years after the particular episode aired. This was subsequently mentioned in a <em><a href="Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine" title="wikilink">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> episode called "<a href="Facets_(DS9_episode)" title="wikilink">Facets</a>" during June 1995 in which <a href="Jadzia_Dax" title="wikilink">Jadzia Dax</a> comments that one of her previous hosts, <a href="Tobin_Dax#Tobin_Dax" title="wikilink">Tobin Dax</a>, had "the most original approach to the proof since Wiles over 300 years ago." This reference was generally understood by fans to be a <a href="retroactive_continuity" title="wikilink">retroactive continuity</a> for "The Royale".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A sum, proved impossible by the theorem, appears in an episode of <em><a href="The_Simpsons" title="wikilink">The Simpsons</a></em>, "<a href="Treehouse_of_Horror_VI" title="wikilink">Treehouse of Horror VI</a>". In the three-dimensional world in "Homer<sup>3</sup>", the equation

 is visible, just as the dimension begins to collapse. The joke is that the twelfth root of the sum does evaluate to 1922 due to rounding errors when entered into most handheld calculators; notice that the left hand side is odd, while

These agree to 10 of 44 decimal digits, but notice that simple <a href="Divisibility_rule#Divisibility_by_3" title="wikilink">divisibility rules</a> show 3987 and 4365 are multiples of 3 so that a sum of their powers is also. The same rule reveals that 4472 is <em>not</em> divisible by 3, so that this "equation" cannot hold either.</li>

<li>In <a href="Tom_Stoppard" title="wikilink">Tom Stoppard</a>'s play <em><a href="Arcadia_(play)" title="wikilink">Arcadia</a></em>, Septimus Hodge poses the problem of proving Fermat's Last Theorem to the precocious Thomasina Coverly (who is perhaps a mathematical prodigy), in an attempt to keep her busy. Thomasina's (perhaps perceptive) response is simple—that Fermat had no proof, and it was a joke to drive posterity mad.</li>

Salander's final solution is different from that of Wiles, and the reader never discovers it. Salander claims that the solution was something implied by Fermat's declaration that the margin of the book that the Theorem was printed in was too small for the proof to be shown. The new solution that Salander discovered was later forgotten by her after she is shot in the head. This causes concern about her photographic memory as she has never before forgotten anything.

In need of her help to avoid a planetary catastrophe, Storm mentions Wiles' proof; when asked why he never spoke of it before, he says that he did not want to wake a sleeping goddess.
