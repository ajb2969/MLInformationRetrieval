<h1>Closed manifold</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, a <strong>closed manifold</strong> is a type of <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topological space</a>, namely a <a href="compact_space" title="wikilink">compact</a> <a class="uri" href="manifold" title="wikilink">manifold</a> without boundary. In contexts where no boundary is possible, any compact manifold is a closed manifold.</p>

<p>Compact manifolds are, in an intuitive sense, "finite". By the basic properties of compactness, a closed manifold is the <a href="disjoint_union" title="wikilink">disjoint union</a> of a finite number of connected closed manifolds. One of the most basic objectives of <a href="geometric_topology" title="wikilink">geometric topology</a> is to understand what the supply of possible closed manifolds is.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>The simplest example is a <a class="uri" href="circle" title="wikilink">circle</a>, which is a compact one-dimensional manifold. Other examples of closed manifolds are the <a class="uri" href="torus" title="wikilink">torus</a> and the <a href="Klein_bottle" title="wikilink">Klein bottle</a>. As a counterexample, the <a href="real_line" title="wikilink">real line</a> is not a closed manifold because it is not compact. A <a href="Disk_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">disk</a> is a compact two-dimensional manifold, but is not a closed manifold because it has a boundary.</p>

<p>All compact topological manifolds can be embedded into

<h2 id="contrasting-terms">Contrasting terms</h2>

<p>A <strong>compact manifold</strong> means a "manifold" that is compact as a topological space, but possibly has boundary. More precisely, it is a compact manifold with boundary (the boundary may be empty). By contrast, a closed manifold is compact <em>without</em> boundary.</p>

<p>An <strong>open manifold</strong> is a manifold without boundary with no compact component. For a connected manifold, "open" is equivalent to "without boundary and non-compact", but for a disconnected manifold, open is stronger. For instance, the <a href="disjoint_union" title="wikilink">disjoint union</a> of a circle and the line is non-compact, but is not an open manifold, since one component (the circle) is compact.</p>

<p>The notion of closed manifold is unrelated with that of a <a href="closed_set" title="wikilink">closed set</a>. A disk with its boundary is a closed subset of the plane, but not a closed manifold.</p>
<h2 id="use-in-physics">Use in physics</h2>

<p>The notion of a "<a href="Shape_of_the_Universe" title="wikilink">closed universe</a>" can refer to the universe being a closed manifold but more likely refers to the universe being a manifold of constant positive <a href="Ricci_curvature" title="wikilink">Ricci curvature</a>.</p>
