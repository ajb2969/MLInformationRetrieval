<h1>Euclid's Elements</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Euclid's <em>Elements</em></strong> ( <em>Stoicheia</em>) is a <a href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematical</a> and <a href="geometry" title="wikilink">geometric</a> <a class="uri" href="treatise" title="wikilink">treatise</a> consisting of 13 books written by the ancient <a href="Greek_mathematics" title="wikilink">Greek mathematician</a> <a class="uri" href="Euclid" title="wikilink">Euclid</a> in <a class="uri" href="Alexandria" title="wikilink">Alexandria</a>, <a href="Ptolemaic_Egypt" title="wikilink">Ptolemaic Egypt</a> c. 300 BC. It is a collection of definitions, postulates (<a href="axiom" title="wikilink">axioms</a>), propositions (<a href="theorem" title="wikilink">theorems</a> and <a href="Compass_and_straightedge_constructions" title="wikilink">constructions</a>), and <a href="mathematical_proof" title="wikilink">mathematical proofs</a> of the propositions. The thirteen books cover <a href="Euclidean_geometry" title="wikilink">Euclidean geometry</a> and the ancient Greek version of elementary <a href="number_theory" title="wikilink">number theory</a>. The work also includes an algebraic system that has become known as <a href="Greek_geometric_algebra" title="wikilink">geometric algebra</a>, which is powerful enough to solve many algebraic problems,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> including the problem of finding the <a href="square_root" title="wikilink">square root</a> of a number.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> With the exception of <a href="Autolycus_of_Pitane" title="wikilink">Autolycus'</a> <em>On the Moving Sphere</em>, the <em>Elements</em> is one of the oldest extant Greek mathematical treatises,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and it is the oldest extant axiomatic deductive treatment of <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>. It has proven instrumental in the development of <a class="uri" href="logic" title="wikilink">logic</a> and modern <a class="uri" href="science" title="wikilink">science</a>. According to <a class="uri" href="Proclus" title="wikilink">Proclus</a> the term "element" was used to describe a theorem that is all-pervading and helps furnishing proofs of many other theorems. The word 'element' is in the Greek language the same as 'letter'. This suggests that theorems in the <em>Elements</em> should be seen as standing in the same relation to geometry as letters to language. Later commentators give a slightly different meaning to the term 'element', emphasizing how the propositions have progressed in small steps, and continued to build on previous propositions in a well-defined order.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Euclid's <em>Elements</em> has been referred to as the most successful<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and influential<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> textbook ever written. Being first set in type in <a class="uri" href="Venice" title="wikilink">Venice</a> in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the <a href="printing_press" title="wikilink">printing press</a> and was estimated by <a href="Carl_Benjamin_Boyer" title="wikilink">Carl Benjamin Boyer</a> to be second only to the <a class="uri" href="Bible" title="wikilink">Bible</a> in the number of editions published,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> with the number reaching well over one thousand.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> For centuries, when the <a class="uri" href="quadrivium" title="wikilink">quadrivium</a> was included in the curriculum of all university students, knowledge of at least part of Euclid's <em>Elements</em> was required of all students. Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.<ref>From the introduction by Amit Hagar to <em>Euclid and His Modern Rivals</em> by Lewis Carroll (2009, Barnes &amp; Noble) pg. xxviii:</ref></p>
<blockquote>

<p>Geometry emerged as an indispensable part of the standard education of the English gentleman in the eighteenth century; by the Victorian period it was also becoming an important part of the education of artisans, children at Board Schools, colonial subjects and, to a rather lesser degree, women. ... The standard textbook for this purpose was none other than Euclid's <em>The Elements</em>.</p>

<h3 id="basis-in-earlier-work">Basis in earlier work</h3>

<p> Scholars believe that the <em>Elements</em> is largely a collection of theorems proven by other mathematicians, supplemented by some original work.</p>

<p><a class="uri" href="Proclus" title="wikilink">Proclus</a> (412 – 485 AD), a Greek mathematician who lived around seven centuries after Euclid, wrote in his commentary on the <em>Elements</em>: "Euclid, who put together the <em>Elements</em>, collecting many of <a href="Eudoxus_of_Cnidus" title="wikilink">Eudoxus</a>' theorems, perfecting many of <a href="Theaetetus_(mathematician)" title="wikilink">Theaetetus</a>', and also bringing to irrefragable demonstration the things which were only somewhat loosely proved by his predecessors".</p>

<p><a class="uri" href="Pythagoras" title="wikilink">Pythagoras</a>(c. 570 – c. 495 BCE) was probably the source for most of books I and II, <a href="Hippocrates_of_Chios" title="wikilink">Hippocrates of Chios</a> (c. 470 – c. 410 BCE, not the better known <a href="Hippocrates" title="wikilink">Hippocrates of Kos</a>) for book III, and <a href="Eudoxus_of_Cnidus" title="wikilink">Eudoxus of Cnidus</a> (c. 408 – c. 355 BC) for book V, while books IV, VI, XI, and XII probably came from other Pythagorean or Athenian mathematicians.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The <em>Elements</em> may have been based on an earlier textbook by Hippocrates of Chios, who also may have originated the use of letters to refer to figures.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="transmission-of-the-text">Transmission of the text</h3>

<p>In the fourth century AD, <a href="Theon_of_Alexandria" title="wikilink">Theon of Alexandria</a> produced an edition of Euclid which was so widely used that it became the only surviving source until <a href=":fr:François_Peyrard" title="wikilink">François Peyrard</a>'s 1808 discovery at the <a href="Vatican_Library" title="wikilink">Vatican</a> of a manuscript not derived from Theon's. This manuscript, the <a href="Johan_Ludvig_Heiberg_(historian)" title="wikilink">Heiberg</a> manuscript, is from a <a class="uri" href="Byzantine" title="wikilink">Byzantine</a> workshop c. 900 and is the basis of modern editions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> <a href="Papyrus_Oxyrhynchus_29" title="wikilink">Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 29</a> is a tiny fragment of an even older manuscript, but only contains the statement of one proposition.</p>

<p>Although known to, for instance, <a class="uri" href="Cicero" title="wikilink">Cicero</a>, there is no extant record of the text having been translated into Latin prior to <a class="uri" href="Boethius" title="wikilink">Boethius</a> in the fifth or sixth century.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The Arabs received the <em>Elements</em> from the Byzantines in approximately 760; this version was translated into <a class="uri" href="Arabic" title="wikilink">Arabic</a> under <a href="Harun_al_Rashid" title="wikilink">Harun al Rashid</a> c. 800.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The Byzantine scholar <a href="Arethas_of_Caesarea" title="wikilink">Arethas</a> commissioned the copying of one of the extant Greek manuscripts of Euclid in the late ninth century.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Although known in Byzantium, the <em>Elements</em> was lost to Western Europe until c. 1120, when the English monk <a href="Adelard_of_Bath" title="wikilink">Adelard of Bath</a> translated it into Latin from an Arabic translation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p> The first printed edition appeared in 1482 (based on <a href="Campanus_of_Novara" title="wikilink">Campanus of Novara's</a> 1260 edition),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and since then it has been translated into many languages and published in about a thousand different editions. Theon's Greek edition was recovered in 1533. In 1570, <a href="John_Dee_(mathematician)" title="wikilink">John Dee</a> provided a widely respected "Mathematical Preface", along with copious notes and supplementary material, to the first English edition by <a href="Henry_Billingsley" title="wikilink">Henry Billingsley</a>.</p>

<p>Copies of the Greek text still exist, some of which can be found in the <a href="Vatican_Library" title="wikilink">Vatican Library</a> and the <a href="Bodleian_Library" title="wikilink">Bodleian Library</a> in Oxford. The manuscripts available are of variable quality, and invariably incomplete. By careful analysis of the translations and originals, hypotheses have been made about the contents of the original text (copies of which are no longer available).</p>

<p>Ancient texts which refer to the <em>Elements</em> itself, and to other mathematical theories that were current at the time it was written, are also important in this process. Such analyses are conducted by <a href="Johan_Ludvig_Heiberg_(historian)" title="wikilink">J. L. Heiberg</a> and Sir <a href="Thomas_Little_Heath" title="wikilink">Thomas Little Heath</a> in their editions of the text.</p>

<p>Also of importance are the <a class="uri" href="scholia" title="wikilink">scholia</a>, or annotations to the text. These additions, which often distinguished themselves from the main text (depending on the manuscript), gradually accumulated over time as opinions varied upon what was worthy of explanation or further study.</p>

<p>The <em>Elements</em> is still considered a masterpiece in the application of <a class="uri" href="logic" title="wikilink">logic</a> to <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>. In historical context, it has proven enormously influential in many areas of <a class="uri" href="science" title="wikilink">science</a>. Scientists <a href="Nicolaus_Copernicus" title="wikilink">Nicolaus Copernicus</a>, <a href="Johannes_Kepler" title="wikilink">Johannes Kepler</a>, <a href="Galileo_Galilei" title="wikilink">Galileo Galilei</a>, and Sir <a href="Isaac_Newton" title="wikilink">Isaac Newton</a> were all influenced by the <em>Elements</em>, and applied their knowledge of it to their work. Mathematicians and philosophers, such as <a href="Bertrand_Russell" title="wikilink">Bertrand Russell</a>, <a href="Alfred_North_Whitehead" title="wikilink">Alfred North Whitehead</a>, and <a href="Baruch_Spinoza" title="wikilink">Baruch Spinoza</a>, have attempted to create their own foundational "Elements" for their respective disciplines, by adopting the axiomatized deductive structures that Euclid's work introduced.</p>

<p>The austere beauty of Euclidean geometry has been seen by many in western culture as a glimpse of an otherworldly system of perfection and certainty. Abraham Lincoln kept a copy of Euclid in his saddlebag, and studied it late at night by lamplight; he related that he said to himself, "You never can make a lawyer if you do not understand what demonstrate means; and I left my situation in Springfield, went home to my father's house, and stayed there till I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid at sight".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> <a href="Edna_St._Vincent_Millay" title="wikilink">Edna St. Vincent Millay</a> wrote in her sonnet <em>Euclid Alone Has Looked on Beauty Bare</em>, "O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day, When first the shaft into his vision shone Of light anatomized!". <a class="uri" href="Einstein" title="wikilink">Einstein</a> recalled a copy of the <em>Elements</em> and a magnetic compass as two gifts that had a great influence on him as a boy, referring to the Euclid as the "holy little geometry book".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>The success of the <em>Elements</em> is due primarily to its logical presentation of most of the mathematical knowledge available to Euclid. Much of the material is not original to him, although many of the proofs are his. However, Euclid's systematic development of his subject, from a small set of axioms to deep results, and the consistency of his approach throughout the <em>Elements</em>, encouraged its use as a textbook for about 2,000 years. The <em>Elements</em> still influences modern geometry books. Further, its logical axiomatic approach and rigorous proofs remain the cornerstone of mathematics.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3 id="contents-of-the-books">Contents of the books</h3>

<p>Books 1 through 4 deal with <a href="plane_geometry" title="wikilink">plane geometry</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Book 1 contains Euclid's 10 axioms (5 named postulates—including the <a href="parallel_postulate" title="wikilink">parallel postulate</a>—and 5 named axioms) and the basic propositions of geometry: the <em><a href="pons_asinorum" title="wikilink">pons asinorum</a></em> (proposition 5), the <a href="Pythagorean_theorem" title="wikilink">Pythagorean theorem</a> (Proposition 47), equality of angles and <a href="area" title="wikilink">areas</a>, parallelism, the sum of the angles in a triangle, and the three cases in which triangles are "equal" (have the same area).</li>
<li>Book 2 is commonly called the "book of <a href="Greek_geometric_algebra" title="wikilink">geometric algebra</a>" because most of the propositions can be seen as geometric interpretations of algebraic identities, such as  = <em>ab</em> + <em>ac</em> + ... or (2<em>a</em> + <em>b</em>)<sup>2</sup> + <em>b</em><sup>2</sup> = 2(<em>a</em><sup>2</sup> + (<em>a</em> + <em>b</em>)<sup>2</sup>). It also contains a method of finding the <a href="square_root" title="wikilink">square root</a> of a given number.</li>
<li>Book 3 deals with circles and their properties: <a href="inscribe" title="wikilink">inscribed</a> angles, <a href="tangent" title="wikilink">tangents</a>, the power of a point, <a href="Thales'_theorem" title="wikilink">Thales' theorem</a>.</li>
<li>Book 4 constructs the <a class="uri" href="incircle" title="wikilink">incircle</a> and <a class="uri" href="circumcircle" title="wikilink">circumcircle</a> of a triangle, and constructs <a href="regular_polygon" title="wikilink">regular polygons</a> with 4, 5, 6, and 15 sides.</li>
</ul>

<p>Books 5 through 10 introduce <a href="ratio" title="wikilink">ratios</a> and <a href="proportionality_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">proportions</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Book 5 is a treatise on proportions of <a href="magnitude_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">magnitudes</a>. Proposition 25 has as a special case the <a href="inequality_of_arithmetic_and_geometric_means" title="wikilink">inequality of arithmetic and geometric means</a>.</li>
<li>Book 6 applies proportions to geometry: <a href="similarity_(geometry)" title="wikilink">similar figures</a>.</li>
<li>Book 7 deals strictly with elementary number theory: <a class="uri" href="divisibility" title="wikilink">divisibility</a>, <a href="prime_number" title="wikilink">prime numbers</a>, <a href="Euclidean_algorithm" title="wikilink">Euclid's algorithm</a> for finding the <a href="greatest_common_divisor" title="wikilink">greatest common divisor</a>, <a href="least_common_multiple" title="wikilink">least common multiple</a>. Propositions 30 and 32 together are essentially equivalent to the <a href="fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic" title="wikilink">fundamental theorem of arithmetic</a> stating that every positive integer can be written as a product of primes in an essentially unique way, though Euclid would have had trouble stating it in this modern form as he did not use the product of more than 3 numbers.</li>
<li>Book 8 deals with proportions in number theory and <a href="geometric_progression" title="wikilink">geometric sequences</a>.</li>
<li>Book 9 applies the results of the preceding two books and gives the infinitude of prime numbers (proposition 20), the sum of a <a href="geometric_series" title="wikilink">geometric series</a> (proposition 35), and the construction of even <a href="perfect_number" title="wikilink">perfect numbers</a> (proposition 36).</li>
<li>Book 10 attempts to classify <a href="commensurability_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">incommensurable</a> (in modern language, <a href="irrational_number" title="wikilink">irrational</a>) magnitudes by using the <a href="method_of_exhaustion" title="wikilink">method of exhaustion</a>, a precursor to <a href="integral" title="wikilink">integration</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Books 11 through to 13 deal with spatial geometry:</p>
<ul>
<li>Book 11 generalizes the results of Books 1–6 to space: perpendicularity, parallelism, volumes of <a href="parallelepiped" title="wikilink">parallelepipeds</a>.</li>
<li>Book 12 studies volumes of <a href="cone_(geometry)" title="wikilink">cones</a>, <a href="Pyramid_(geometry)" title="wikilink">pyramids</a>, and <a href="cylinder_(geometry)" title="wikilink">cylinders</a> in detail, and shows for example that the volume of a cone is a third of the volume of the corresponding cylinder. It concludes by showing the volume of a <a class="uri" href="sphere" title="wikilink">sphere</a> is proportional to the cube of its radius by approximating it by a union of many pyramids.</li>
<li>Book 13 constructs the five regular <a href="Platonic_solid" title="wikilink">Platonic solids</a> inscribed in a sphere, calculates the ratio of their edges to the radius of the sphere, and proves that there are no further regular solids.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="euclids-method-and-style-of-presentation">Euclid's method and style of presentation</h2>

<p> Euclid's <a href="Axiomatic_system#Axiomatic_method" title="wikilink">axiomatic approach</a> and <a href="Euclidean_geometry#Methods_of_proof" title="wikilink">constructive methods</a> were widely influential.</p>

<p>As was common in ancient mathematical texts, when a proposition needed <a href="Mathematical_proof" title="wikilink">proof</a> in several different cases, Euclid often proved only one of them (often the most difficult), leaving the others to the reader. Later editors such as <a href="Theon_of_Alexandria" title="wikilink">Theon</a> often interpolated their own proofs of these cases.</p>

<p>Euclid's presentation was limited by the mathematical ideas and notations in common currency in his era, and this causes the treatment to seem awkward to the modern reader in some places. For example, there was no notion of an angle greater than two right angles,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> the number 1 was sometimes treated separately from other positive integers, and as multiplication was treated geometrically he did not use the product of more than 3 different numbers. The geometrical treatment of number theory may have been because the alternative would have been the extremely awkward <a href="Greek_numerals" title="wikilink">Alexandrian system of numerals</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>The presentation of each result is given in a stylized form, which, although not invented by Euclid, is recognized as typically classical. It has six different parts: First is the <em>enunciation</em> which states the result in general terms (i.e. the statement of the proposition). Then the <em>setting-out</em>, which gives the figure and denotes particular geometrical objects by letters. Next comes the <em>definition</em> or <em>specification</em> which restates the enunciation in terms of the particular figure. Then the <em>construction</em> or <em>machinery</em> follows. It is here that the original figure is extended to forward the proof. Then, the <em>proof</em> itself follows. Finally, the <em>conclusion</em> connects the proof to the enunciation by stating the specific conclusions drawn in the proof, in the general terms of the enunciation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p>No indication is given of the method of reasoning that led to the result, although the <em><a href="Data_(Euclid)" title="wikilink">Data</a></em> does provide instruction about how to approach the types of problems encountered in the first four books of the <em>Elements</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Some scholars have tried to find fault in Euclid's use of figures in his proofs, accusing him of writing proofs that depended on the specific figures drawn rather than the general underlying logic, especially concerning Proposition II of Book I. However, Euclid's original proof of this proposition is general, valid, and does not depend on the figure used as an example to illustrate one given configuration.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="criticism">Criticism</h2>

<p>Euclid's list of axioms in the <em>Elements</em> was not exhaustive, but represented the principles that were the most important. His proofs often invoke axiomatic notions which were not originally presented in his list of axioms. Later editors have interpolated Euclid's implicit axiomatic assumptions in the list of formal axioms.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>For example, in the first construction of Book 1, Euclid used a premise that was neither postulated nor proved: that two circles with centers at the distance of their radius will intersect in two points.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Later, in the fourth construction, he used superposition (moving the triangles on top of each other) to prove that if two sides and their angles are equal then they are congruent; during these considerations he uses some properties of superposition, but these properties are not described explicitly in the treatise. If superposition is to be considered a valid method of geometric proof, all of geometry would be full of such proofs. For example, propositions I.1 – I.3 can be proved trivially by using superposition.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>Mathematician and historian <a href="W._W._Rouse_Ball" title="wikilink">W. W. Rouse Ball</a> put the criticisms in perspective, remarking that "the fact that for two thousand years [the <em>Elements</em>] was the usual text-book on the subject raises a strong presumption that it is not unsuitable for that purpose."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="apocrypha">Apocrypha</h2>

<p>It was not uncommon in ancient time to attribute to celebrated authors works that were not written by them. It is by these means that the <a class="uri" href="apocryphal" title="wikilink">apocryphal</a> books XIV and XV of the <em>Elements</em> were sometimes included in the collection.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The spurious Book XIV was probably written by <a class="uri" href="Hypsicles" title="wikilink">Hypsicles</a> on the basis of a treatise by <a href="Apollonius_of_Perga" title="wikilink">Apollonius</a>. The book continues Euclid's comparison of regular solids inscribed in spheres, with the chief result being that the ratio of the surfaces of the <a class="uri" href="dodecahedron" title="wikilink">dodecahedron</a> and <a class="uri" href="icosahedron" title="wikilink">icosahedron</a> inscribed in the same sphere is the same as the ratio of their volumes, the ratio being</p>
