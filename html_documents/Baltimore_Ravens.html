<h1>Baltimore Ravens</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>Baltimore Ravens</strong> are a professional <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">American football</a> team in <a href="Baltimore,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Baltimore, Maryland</a>, who are members of the <a href="AFC_North" title="wikilink">AFC North</a> Division of the <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a> (NFL). The team play home games at <a href="M&amp;T;_Bank_Stadium" title="wikilink">M&amp;T; Bank Stadium</a> and have their headquarters in <a href="Owings_Mills" title="wikilink">Owings Mills</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The Ravens were established in 1996, when then-owner of the <a href="Cleveland_Browns" title="wikilink">Cleveland Browns</a>, <a href="Art_Modell" title="wikilink">Art Modell</a>, announced plans to <a href="Cleveland_Browns_relocation_controversy" title="wikilink">relocate</a> the franchise to Baltimore.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> As part of a settlement between the league and the city of Cleveland, Modell was required to leave the Browns' heritage in Cleveland for a replacement team and replacement personnel that would take control in 1999 and the history and records of the Browns. In return, he was allowed to take his own personnel and team to Baltimore, where such personnel would then form an expansion team. The team's name was inspired by <a href="Edgar_Allan_Poe" title="wikilink">Edgar Allan Poe</a>'s poem <em><a href="The_Raven" title="wikilink">The Raven</a></em>.</p>

<p>The Ravens have made the playoffs ten times since 2000, with two Super Bowl victories (<a href="Super_Bowl_XXXV" title="wikilink">Super Bowl XXXV</a> and <a href="Super_Bowl_XLVII" title="wikilink">Super Bowl XLVII</a>), two AFC Championship titles (2000 and 2012), four AFC North division titles (2003, 2006, 2011 and 2012), and are currently the only team in the NFL to hold a perfect record in multiple Super Bowl appearances. The Ravens organization has been led by general manager <a href="Ozzie_Newsome" title="wikilink">Ozzie Newsome</a> since 1996, and has had three head coaches: <a href="Ted_Marchibroda" title="wikilink">Ted Marchibroda</a>, <a href="Brian_Billick" title="wikilink">Brian Billick</a>, and <a href="John_Harbaugh" title="wikilink">John Harbaugh</a>. With a record-breaking defensive unit in their <a href="2000_Baltimore_Ravens_season" title="wikilink">2000 season</a>, the team established a reputation for relying on strong defensive play, led by players like middle linebacker <a href="Ray_Lewis" title="wikilink">Ray Lewis</a>, who, until his retirement, was considered the "face of the franchise."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The team is owned by <a href="Steve_Bisciotti" title="wikilink">Steve Bisciotti</a> and valued at $1.5 billion, making the Ravens the 24th-most valuable sports franchise in the world.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>After the <a href="Baltimore_Colts_relocation_to_Indianapolis" title="wikilink">controversial relocation</a> of the <a href="History_of_the_Baltimore_Colts" title="wikilink">Colts</a> to Indianapolis, several attempts were made to bring an NFL team back to Baltimore. In 1993, ahead of the 1995 league expansion, the city was considered a favorite, behind only <a href="St._Louis" title="wikilink">St. Louis</a>, to be granted one of two new franchises.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> League officials and team owners feared litigation due to conflicts between rival bidding groups if St. Louis was awarded a franchise, and in October <a href="Charlotte,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Charlotte, North Carolina</a> was the first city chosen. Several weeks later, Baltimore's bid for a franchise—dubbed the <a href="Baltimore_Bombers_(proposed_NFL_team)" title="wikilink">Baltimore Bombers</a>, in honor of the locally-produced <a href="Martin_B-26_Marauder" title="wikilink">Martin B-26 Marauder</a> <a class="uri" href="bomber" title="wikilink">bomber</a>—had three ownership groups in place<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and a state financial package which included a proposed $200 million, rent-free stadium and permission to charge up to $80 million in personal seat license fees.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Baltimore, however, was unexpectedly passed over in favor of <a href="Jacksonville,_Florida" title="wikilink">Jacksonville, Florida</a>, despite Jacksonville's minor TV market status and that the city had withdrawn from contention in the summer, only to return with then-Commissioner <a href="Paul_Tagliabue" title="wikilink">Paul Tagliabue</a>'s urging.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Although league officials denied that any city had been favored, it was reported that Taglibue and his longtime friend <a href="Washington_Redskins" title="wikilink">Washington Redskins</a> owner <a href="Jack_Kent_Cooke" title="wikilink">Jack Kent Cooke</a> had lobbied against Baltimore due to its proximity to Washington, D.C.,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and that Taglibue had used the initial committee voting system to prevent the entire league ownership from voting on Baltimore's bid.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> This led to public outrage and the <em><a href="Baltimore_Sun" title="wikilink">Baltimore Sun</a></em> describing Taglibue as having an "Anybody But Baltimore" policy.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Maryland governor <a href="William_Donald_Schaefer" title="wikilink">William Donald Schaefer</a> said afterward that Taglibue had led him on, praising Baltimore and the proposed owners while working behind-the-scenes to oppose Baltimore's bid.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>By May 1994, <a href="Baltimore_Orioles" title="wikilink">Baltimore Orioles</a> owner <a href="Peter_Angelos" title="wikilink">Peter Angelos</a> had gathered a new group of investors, including author <a href="Tom_Clancy" title="wikilink">Tom Clancy</a>, to bid on teams whose owners had expressed interest in relocating.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Angelos found a potential partner in <a href="Georgia_Frontiere" title="wikilink">Georgia Frontiere</a>, who was open to moving the <a href="Los_Angeles_Rams" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Rams</a> to Baltimore. Jack Kent Cooke opposed the move, intending to build the Redskins' new stadium in <a href="Laurel,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Laurel, Maryland</a>, close enough to Baltimore to cool outside interest in bringing in a new franchise.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> This led to heated arguments between Cooke and Angelos, who accused Cooke of being a "<a class="uri" href="carpetbagger" title="wikilink">carpetbagger</a>."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The league eventually persuaded Rams team president John Shaw to relocate to St. Louis instead, leading to a league-wide rumor that Tagliabue was again steering interest away from Baltimore, a claim which Tagliabue denied.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> In response to anger in Baltimore, including Governor Schaefer's threat to announce over the loudspeakers Tagliabue's exact location in <a href="Camden_Yards" title="wikilink">Camden Yards</a> any time he attended a <a href="Baltimore_Orioles" title="wikilink">Baltimore Orioles</a> game,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Tagliabue remarked of Baltimore's financial package: "Maybe (Baltimore) can open another museum with that money."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Following this, Angelos made an unsuccessful $200 million bid to bring the <a href="Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers" title="wikilink">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> to Baltimore.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p>Having failed to obtain a franchise via the expansion, the city, despite having "misgivings,"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> turned to the possibility of obtaining the <a href="Cleveland_Browns" title="wikilink">Cleveland Browns</a>, whose owner <a href="Art_Modell" title="wikilink">Art Modell</a> was financially struggling and at odds with the city of <a class="uri" href="Cleveland" title="wikilink">Cleveland</a> over needed improvements to the team's stadium.</p>
<h3 id="relocation-from-cleveland-ohio">Relocation from Cleveland, Ohio</h3>

<p>Enticed by Baltimore's available funds for a first-class stadium, Modell announced on November 6, 1995 his intention to relocate the team from Cleveland to Baltimore the following year. The resulting <a href="Cleveland_Browns_relocation_controversy" title="wikilink">controversy</a> ended when representatives of Cleveland and the NFL reached a settlement on February 8, 1996. Tagliabue promised the city of Cleveland that an NFL team would be located in Cleveland, either through relocation or expansion, "no later than 1999".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Additionally, the agreement stipulated that the Browns' name, colors, uniform design and franchise records would remain in Cleveland. The franchise history includes Browns club records and connections with <a href="Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a> players. Modell's Baltimore team, while retaining all current player contracts, would, for purposes of team history, appear as an <a href="expansion_team" title="wikilink">expansion team</a>, a "new franchise."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Not all players, staff or front office would make the move to Baltimore, however.  After relocation, Modell hired <a href="Ted_Marchibroda" title="wikilink">Ted Marchibroda</a> as the head coach for his new team in Baltimore. Marchibroda was already well known because of his work as head coach of the <a href="History_of_the_Baltimore_Colts" title="wikilink">Baltimore Colts</a> during the 1970s and the <a href="Indianapolis_Colts" title="wikilink">Indianapolis Colts</a> during the early 1990s. <a href="Ozzie_Newsome" title="wikilink">Ozzie Newsome</a>, the Browns' tight end for many seasons, joined Modell in Baltimore as director of football operations. He was later promoted to vice-president/general manager. A fan contest, drawing 33,288 voters, was then held to determine the team's name. The chosen name, "Ravens," alludes to the famous poem <em><a href="The_Raven" title="wikilink">The Raven</a></em> by <a href="Edgar_Allan_Poe" title="wikilink">Edgar Allan Poe</a>, who spent the early part of his career in Baltimore.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>The home stadium for the Ravens first two seasons was Baltimore's <a href="Memorial_Stadium_(Baltimore)" title="wikilink">Memorial Stadium</a>, home field of the <a href="History_of_the_Baltimore_Colts" title="wikilink">Baltimore Colts</a> and <a href="Baltimore_Stallions" title="wikilink">Baltimore Stallions</a> years before. The Ravens moved to their own new stadium next to <a href="Camden_Yards" title="wikilink">Camden Yards</a> in 1998. Raven Stadium would subsequently wear the names <a href="PSINet" title="wikilink">PSI Net</a> Stadium and then <a href="M&amp;T;_Bank_Stadium" title="wikilink">M&amp;T; Bank Stadium</a>.</p>

<h4 id="section">1996</h4>

<p>In the <a href="1996_NFL_Draft" title="wikilink">1996 NFL Draft</a>, the Ravens, with two picks in the first round, drafted offensive tackle <a href="Jonathan_Ogden" title="wikilink">Jonathan Ogden</a> at No. 4 overall and linebacker <a href="Ray_Lewis" title="wikilink">Ray Lewis</a> at No. 26 overall.</p>

<p> The 1996 Ravens won their opening game against the <a href="Oakland_Raiders" title="wikilink">Oakland Raiders</a>, but finished the season 4–12 despite receiver <a href="Michael_Jackson_(wide_receiver)" title="wikilink">Michael Jackson</a> leading the league with 14 touchdown catches.</p>
<h4 id="section-1">1997</h4>

<p>The 1997 Ravens started 3–1. <a href="Peter_Boulware" title="wikilink">Peter Boulware</a>, a rookie defender from <a href="Florida_State_Seminoles_football" title="wikilink">Florida State</a>, recorded 11.5 sacks and was named AFC Defensive Rookie of the Year. The team finished 6–9–1. On October 26, the team made its first trip to <a href="Landover,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Landover, Maryland</a> to play their new <a href="Baltimore-Washington_Metropolitan_Area" title="wikilink">regional rivals</a>, the <a href="Washington_Redskins" title="wikilink">Washington Redskins</a>, for the first time in the regular season, at the new <a href="FedEx_Field" title="wikilink">Jack Kent Cooke Stadium</a> (replacing the still-standing <a href="RFK_Stadium" title="wikilink">RFK Stadium</a> in <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington, DC</a>). The Ravens won the game 20–17.</p>
<h4 id="section-2">1998</h4>

<p>Quarterback <a href="Vinny_Testaverde" title="wikilink">Vinny Testaverde</a> left for the <a href="New_York_Jets" title="wikilink">New York Jets</a> before the <a href="1998_NFL_season" title="wikilink">1998 season</a>, and was replaced by former Indianapolis Colt <a href="Jim_Harbaugh" title="wikilink">Jim Harbaugh</a>, and later <a href="Eric_Zeier" title="wikilink">Eric Zeier</a>. Cornerback <a href="Rod_Woodson" title="wikilink">Rod Woodson</a> joined the team after a successful stint with the <a href="Pittsburgh_Steelers" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, and <a href="Priest_Holmes" title="wikilink">Priest Holmes</a> started getting the first playing time of his career and ran for 1,000 yards.</p>

<p>The Ravens finished 1998 with a 6–10 record. On November 29, the Ravens welcomed the Colts back to Baltimore for the first time in 15 years. Amidst a shower of negative cheers towards the Colts, the Ravens, with Jim Harbaugh at quarterback, won 38–31.</p>

<h4 id="section-3">1999</h4>

<p>Three consecutive losing seasons under Marchibroda led to a change in the head coach. <a href="Brian_Billick" title="wikilink">Brian Billick</a> took over as head coach in <a href="1999_NFL_season" title="wikilink">1999</a>. Billick had been offensive coordinator for the record-setting <a href="Minnesota_Vikings" title="wikilink">Minnesota Vikings</a> the season before. Quarterback <a href="Tony_Banks_(quarterback)" title="wikilink">Tony Banks</a> came to Baltimore from the <a href="St._Louis_Rams" title="wikilink">St. Louis Rams</a> and had the best season of his career with 17 touchdown passes and an 81.2 pass rating. He was joined by receiver <a href="Qadry_Ismail" title="wikilink">Qadry Ismail</a>, who posted a 1,000-yard season. The Ravens initially struggled with a record of 4–7 but managed to finish with an 8–8 record.</p>

<p>Due to continual financial hardships, the NFL directed Modell to initiate the sale of his franchise. On March 27, 2000, NFL owners approved the sale of 49% of the Ravens to <a href="Steve_Bisciotti" title="wikilink">Steve Bisciotti</a>. In the deal, Bisciotti had an option to purchase the remaining 51% for $325 million in 2004 from Art Modell. On April 9, 2004 the NFL approved Steve Bisciotti's purchase of the majority stake in the club.</p>
<h4 id="super-bowl-xxxv-champions">2000: Super Bowl XXXV champions</h4>

<p> The 2000 season saw the Ravens defense, led by defensive coordinator <a href="Marvin_Lewis" title="wikilink">Marvin Lewis</a>, develop into a rock-solid unit that emerged as one of the most formidable defenses in NFL history. The Ravens defense set a new NFL record in holding opposing teams to 165 total points; the feat eclipsed the mark set previously by the <a href="Chicago_Bears" title="wikilink">Chicago Bears</a> of 187 points for a 16 game season. Linebacker <a href="Ray_Lewis" title="wikilink">Ray Lewis</a> was named Defensive Player of the year and, with two of his defensive teammates, <a href="Sam_Adams_(football_player)" title="wikilink">Sam Adams</a> and <a href="Rod_Woodson" title="wikilink">Rod Woodson</a>, made the <a href="2001_Pro_Bowl" title="wikilink">Pro Bowl</a>.</p>

<p>Baltimore's season started strong with a 3–1 record. <a href="Tony_Banks_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Tony Banks</a> began the 2000 season as the starting quarterback and was replaced by <a href="Trent_Dilfer" title="wikilink">Trent Dilfer</a> when the Ravens fell to 5–4, and failed to score an offensive touchdown the entire month of October. Coach <a href="Brian_Billick" title="wikilink">Brian Billick</a> announced that the change at quarterback would be for the rest of the season. The thousand yard rushing season by rookie running back <a href="Jamal_Lewis" title="wikilink">Jamal Lewis</a> combined with the stout Ravens defense kept Baltimore competitive in games even when the offense struggled. At one point in the season the team played five consecutive games without scoring an offensive touchdown but still managed two wins during that stretch. The team regrouped and won each of their last seven games, finishing 12–4. The Ravens had made the playoffs for the first time.</p>

<p>Since the divisional rival <a href="Tennessee_Titans" title="wikilink">Tennessee Titans</a> had a record of 13–3, Baltimore had to play in the wild card round. In their first ever playoff game, they dominated the <a href="Denver_Broncos" title="wikilink">Denver Broncos</a> 21–3 in front of a then record-crowd of 69,638 at then called PSINet Stadium. In the divisional playoffs, they went on the road to Tennessee. Tied 10–10 in the fourth quarter, an <a href="Al_Del_Greco" title="wikilink">Al Del Greco</a> field goal attempt was blocked and returned for a touchdown by <a href="Anthony_Mitchell_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Anthony Mitchell</a>, and a Ray Lewis interception return for a score put the game squarely in Baltimore's favor. The 24–10 win put the Ravens in the AFC Championship against the <a href="Oakland_Raiders" title="wikilink">Oakland Raiders</a>. <a href="Shannon_Sharpe" title="wikilink">Shannon Sharpe</a>'s 96-yard touchdown catch early in the second quarter, followed by an injury to Raiders quarterback <a href="Rich_Gannon" title="wikilink">Rich Gannon</a>, highlighted the Ravens' 16–3 victory.  Baltimore then went to Tampa for <a href="Super_Bowl_XXXV" title="wikilink">Super Bowl XXXV</a> where they met the <a href="New_York_Giants" title="wikilink">New York Giants</a>, cruising to a 34–7 win for their first championship in franchise history. The Ravens recorded four sacks, forced five turnovers, one of which was a <a href="Kerry_Collins" title="wikilink">Kerry Collins</a> interception returned for a touchdown by <a href="Duane_Starks" title="wikilink">Duane Starks</a>. The Giants' only score was a <a href="Ron_Dixon" title="wikilink">Ron Dixon</a> kickoff return for another touchdown (after Starks' interception return), making the 2000 Ravens the third Super Bowl team whose defense did not allow an opponent's offensive score; however, Baltimore immediately countered with a TD return by <a href="Jermaine_Lewis_(American_football,_born_1974)" title="wikilink">Jermaine Lewis</a>. The Ravens became only the third wild-card team to win a Super Bowl championship. The interception return for a touchdown, followed by two kick return TDs, marked the quickest time in Super Bowl history that three touchdowns had been scored.</p>

<p>The title made the Ravens the fourth Baltimore-based pro football team to win a league championship. They were preceded by the NFL <a href="History_of_the_Baltimore_Colts" title="wikilink">Baltimore Colts</a> in <a href="1958_NFL_Championship_Game" title="wikilink">1958</a>, <a href="1959_NFL_season" title="wikilink">1959</a> and <a href="Super_Bowl_V" title="wikilink">1970</a>, the <a href="United_States_Football_League" title="wikilink">USFL</a> <a href="Baltimore_Stars" title="wikilink">Stars</a> in <a href="1985_USFL_season" title="wikilink">1985</a> and the <a href="Canadian_Football_League" title="wikilink">CFL</a> <a href="Baltimore_Stallions" title="wikilink">Stallions</a> in <a href="83rd_Grey_Cup" title="wikilink">1995</a>.</p>
<h4 id="section-4">2001</h4>

<p>In <a href="2001_NFL_season" title="wikilink">2001</a>, the Ravens attempted to defend its title with <a href="Elvis_Grbac" title="wikilink">Elvis Grbac</a> as its new starting quarterback, but a season-ending injury to <a href="Jamal_Lewis" title="wikilink">Jamal Lewis</a> on the first day of training camp and poor offensive performances stymied the team. After a 3–3 start, the Ravens defeated the <a href="Minnesota_Vikings" title="wikilink">Minnesota Vikings</a> in the final week to clinch a wild card berth at 10–6. In the first round the Ravens showed flashes of their previous year with a 20–3 win over the <a href="Miami_Dolphins" title="wikilink">Miami Dolphins</a>, in which the team forced three turnovers and out-gained the Dolphins 347 yards to 151. In the divisional playoff the Ravens played the <a href="Pittsburgh_Steelers" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>. Three interceptions by Grbac ended the Ravens' season, as they lost 27–10.</p>
<h4 id="section-5">2002</h4>

<p>Baltimore ran into <a href="salary_cap" title="wikilink">salary cap</a> problems entering the 2002 season and was forced to part with a number of impact players. In the NFL Draft, the team selected <a href="Ed_Reed" title="wikilink">Ed Reed</a> with the 24th overall pick. Reed would go on to become one of the better safeties in NFL history, making nine Pro Bowls until leaving the Ravens for the Houston Texans in 2013. Despite low expectations, the Ravens stayed somewhat competitive in 2002 until a losing streak in December eliminated any chances of a post-season berth. Their final record that year was 7–9.</p>
<h4 id="section-6">2003</h4>

<p> The Ravens needed a quarterback but drafting after all the top quarterbacks were gone, used their 10th pick to select <a href="Arizona_State_Sun_Devils_football" title="wikilink">Arizona State</a> defensive end <a href="Terrell_Suggs" title="wikilink">Terrell Suggs</a>. They then traded their 2003 2nd round pick and 2004 1st round pick to the <a href="New_England_Patriots" title="wikilink">New England Patriots</a> for the 19th overall selection which they used to draft <a href="California_Golden_Bears_football" title="wikilink">Cal</a> quarterback <a href="Kyle_Boller" title="wikilink">Kyle Boller</a>. The Patriots eventually used the Ravens' 2004 1st round selection to take defensive tackle <a href="Vince_Wilfork" title="wikilink">Vince Wilfork</a>.</p>

<p>The Ravens named Boller their starting QB just prior to the start of the <a href="2003_NFL_season" title="wikilink">2003 season</a>, but he was injured midway through the season and was replaced by <a href="Anthony_Wright_(quarterback)" title="wikilink">Anthony Wright</a>. The Ravens held a 5–5 record until, in a home game against the <a href="Seattle_Seahawks" title="wikilink">Seattle Seahawks</a>, they wiped out a 41–24 gap in the final seven minutes of regulation, then won on a <a href="Matt_Stover" title="wikilink">Matt Stover</a> field goal in overtime for a 44–41 triumph. From there the Ravens won five of their last six games. With a 10–6 record, Baltimore won their first AFC North division title. Running back <a href="Jamal_Lewis" title="wikilink">Jamal Lewis</a> ran for 2,066 yards on the season, including a then NFL single-game record of 295 yards at home against the <a href="Cleveland_Browns" title="wikilink">Cleveland Browns</a> on September 14. In doing so, Lewis became only the fifth player to eclipse the 2,000-yard rushing mark in league history, with his single-season total placing second all-time; just 39 yards short of the NFL record held by <a href="Eric_Dickerson" title="wikilink">Eric Dickerson</a>. Their first playoff game, at home against the <a href="Tennessee_Titans" title="wikilink">Tennessee Titans</a>, went back and forth, with the Ravens being held to only 100 yards total rushing. The Ravens lost, though, by three, 20–17.</p>

<p>For his remarkable season, <a href="Jamal_Lewis" title="wikilink">Jamal Lewis</a> was named as the <a href="NFL_Offensive_Player_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">NFL Offensive Player of the Year</a>, while linebacker <a href="Ray_Lewis" title="wikilink">Ray Lewis</a>, with another stand-out year that included 6 interceptions, was also recognized as <a href="NFL_Defensive_Player_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">Defensive Player of the Year</a> for the second time in his career. This marked the first time ever that teammates received these respective individual honors in the same season.</p>

<p>After the season, Art Modell officially transferred the remaining bulk of his ownership to Bisciotti, ending over 40 years of tenure as an NFL franchise majority owner. Modell still held an office at the Ravens' headquarters in <a href="Owings_Mills,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Owings Mills, Maryland</a>, and remained with the team as a consultant.</p>
<h4 id="section-7">2004</h4>

<p>The Ravens did not make the playoffs in <a href="2004_NFL_season" title="wikilink">2004</a> and finished the season with a record of 9–7 with <a href="Kyle_Boller" title="wikilink">Kyle Boller</a> spending the season at QB. They did get good play from veteran corner <a href="Deion_Sanders" title="wikilink">Deion Sanders</a> and third year safety <a href="Ed_Reed" title="wikilink">Ed Reed</a>, who won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award. They were also the only team to defeat the 15–1 <a href="Pittsburgh_Steelers" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> in the regular season.</p>
<h4 id="section-8">2005</h4>

<p>In the 2005 offseason the Ravens looked to augment their receiving corps (which was second-worst in the NFL in 2004) by signing <a href="Derrick_Mason" title="wikilink">Derrick Mason</a> from the Titans and drafting star Oklahoma wide receiver <a href="Mark_J._Clayton" title="wikilink">Mark Clayton</a> in the first round of the <a href="2005_NFL_Draft" title="wikilink">2005 NFL Draft</a>. However, the Ravens ended their season 6–10, but defeated the <a href="Green_Bay_Packers" title="wikilink">Green Bay Packers</a> 48–3 on <a href="Monday_Night_Football" title="wikilink">Monday Night Football</a> and the Super Bowl champion Steelers.</p>
<h4 id="section-9">2006</h4>

<p>The 2006 Baltimore Ravens season began with the team trying to improve on their 6–10 record of 2005. The Ravens, for the first time in franchise history, started 4–0, under the leadership of former Titans quarterback <a href="Steve_McNair" title="wikilink">Steve McNair</a>.  The Ravens lost two straight games mid-season on offensive troubles, prompting coach Billick to drop their offensive coordinator <a href="Jim_Fassel" title="wikilink">Jim Fassel</a> in their week seven bye. After the bye, and with Billick calling the offense, Baltimore would record a five-game win streak before losing to the <a href="Cincinnati_Bengals" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Bengals</a> in week 13.</p>

<p>Still ranked second overall to first-place <a href="San_Diego_Chargers" title="wikilink">San Diego Chargers</a>, the Ravens continued on. They defeated the <a href="Kansas_City_Chiefs" title="wikilink">Kansas City Chiefs</a>, and held the defending Super Bowl champion <a href="Pittsburgh_Steelers" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> to only one touchdown at <a href="Heinz_Field" title="wikilink">Heinz Field</a>, allowing the Ravens to clinch the <a href="AFC_North" title="wikilink">AFC North</a>.</p>

<p>The Ravens ended the regular season with a franchise-best 13–3 record. Baltimore had secured the AFC North title, the No. 2 AFC playoff seed, and clinched a 1st-round bye by season's end. The Ravens were slated to face the <a href="Indianapolis_Colts" title="wikilink">Indianapolis Colts</a> in the second round of the playoffs, in the first meeting of the two teams in the playoffs. Many Baltimore and Indianapolis fans saw this historic meeting as a sort of "Judgment Day" with the new team of Baltimore facing the old team of Baltimore (the former Baltimore Colts having left Baltimore under questionable circumstances in 1984). Both Indianapolis and Baltimore were held to scoring only field goals as the two defenses slugged it out all over M&amp;T; Bank Stadium. McNair threw two costly interceptions, including one at the 1-yard line. The eventual Super Bowl champion Colts won 15–6, ending Baltimore's season.  </p>
<h4 id="section-10">2007</h4>

<p>After a stellar 2006 season, the Ravens hoped to improve upon their 13–3 record but injuries and poor play plagued the team. The Ravens finished the <a href="2007_NFL_season" title="wikilink">2007 season</a> in the AFC North cellar with a disappointing 5–11 record. A humiliating 22–16 overtime loss to the previously winless <a href="Miami_Dolphins" title="wikilink">Miami Dolphins</a> on December 16 ultimately led to Billick's dismissal on New Year's Eve, one day after the end of the regular season. He was replaced by John Harbaugh, the special teams coach of the Philadelphia Eagles and the older brother of former Ravens quarterback Jim Harbaugh (1998).</p>

<p>With rookies at head coach (<a href="John_Harbaugh" title="wikilink">John Harbaugh</a>) and quarterback (<a href="Joe_Flacco" title="wikilink">Joe Flacco</a>), the Ravens entered the 2008 campaign with lots of uncertainty. Their Week 2 contest at the <a href="Houston_Texans" title="wikilink">Houston Texans</a> was postponed until two months later because of <a href="Hurricane_Ike" title="wikilink">Hurricane Ike</a>, forcing the Ravens to play for what would eventually be eighteen straight weeks. With its record at 2–3 after consecutive losses to the <a href="Pittsburgh_Steelers" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, <a href="Tennessee_Titans" title="wikilink">Tennessee Titans</a> and <a href="Indianapolis_Colts" title="wikilink">Indianapolis Colts</a>, its triumph over the Dolphins in Week 7 was redemption for what had happened against the same opponent in the previous season. Eight victories in its last ten regular season matches enabled them to clinch the sixth seed in the AFC playoffs at an 11–5 record. Possibly the biggest win during that stretch came in Week 16 with a 33–24 humbling of the <a href="Dallas_Cowboys" title="wikilink">Dallas Cowboys</a> in the final game at <a href="Texas_Stadium" title="wikilink">Texas Stadium</a>. <a href="Willis_McGahee" title="wikilink">Willis McGahee</a>'s 77-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter established a new stadium record which would last until <a href="Le'Ron_McClain" title="wikilink">Le'Ron McClain</a>, on the very first offensive play of the Ravens' next possession, secured the victory with an 82-yarder.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>  On the strength of four interceptions, one resulting in an <a href="Ed_Reed" title="wikilink">Ed Reed</a> touchdown, the Ravens began its postseason run by winning a rematch over Miami 27–9 at <a href="Dolphin_Stadium" title="wikilink">Dolphin Stadium</a> on January 4, 2009 in a wild-card game.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Six days later, they advanced to the <a href="AFC_Championship_Game" title="wikilink">AFC Championship Game</a> by avenging a Week 5 loss to the Titans 13–10 at <a href="LP_Field" title="wikilink">LP Field</a> on a <a href="Matt_Stover" title="wikilink">Matt Stover</a> field goal with 53 seconds left in regulation time.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The Ravens fell one victory short of <a href="Super_Bowl_XLIII" title="wikilink">Super Bowl XLIII</a> by losing to the Steelers 23–14 at <a href="Heinz_Field" title="wikilink">Heinz Field</a> on January 18, 2009.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="section-11">2009</h4>

<p> With <a href="Jonathan_Ogden" title="wikilink">Jonathan Ogden</a> retiring after the 2007 season and <a href="Matt_Stover" title="wikilink">Matt Stover</a> going into free agency, Baltimore's only remaining player from its first season was <a href="Ray_Lewis_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Ray Lewis</a>. The Ravens held the 26th pick in the <a href="2009_NFL_draft" title="wikilink">2009 NFL draft</a> but went up to the 23rd pick by trading its 26th pick and a 5th round pick to the <a href="New_England_Patriots" title="wikilink">New England Patriots</a>. The Ravens selected <a href="Michael_Oher" title="wikilink">Michael Oher</a> (who later had a movie named <em><a href="The_Blind_Side_(film)" title="wikilink">The Blind Side</a></em> made after his life during his early years) in the first round of the NFL Draft.   In the season opener, the offense continued its improvements from the year before as it scored 38 points and accounted for over 500 yards in a 38–24 victory over the <a href="Kansas_City_Chiefs" title="wikilink">Kansas City Chiefs</a>. In week 2, the Ravens defeated the <a href="San_Diego_Chargers" title="wikilink">San Diego Chargers</a> 31–26. Although the Ravens secondary struggled, Ray Lewis made a crucial tackle on fourth down of the Chargers' final drive to seal the Baltimore win. In week 3, the Ravens defeated the <a href="Cleveland_Browns" title="wikilink">Cleveland Browns</a> in a 34–3 blowout while celebrating Derrick Mason's 800th pass reception in his career.  In week 4, the Ravens lost in heartbreak fashion to the <a href="New_England_Patriots" title="wikilink">New England Patriots</a>, 27–21, with their final drive ending with a dropped pass by <a href="Mark_Clayton_(American_football,_born_1982)" title="wikilink">Mark Clayton</a> on 4th down within the 10-yard line with 28 seconds left on the clock. The following week, the Ravens hosted the <a href="Cincinnati_Bengals" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Bengals</a>, but lost with the Bengals' final drive resulting in a touchdown. The Ravens then played an away game against the <a href="Minnesota_Vikings" title="wikilink">Minnesota Vikings</a> and suffered another heartbreaking loss, 33–31, putting them behind both the Bengals and the Steelers in the AFC North. The Ravens had rallied from 17 points down to the Vikings and managed to drive the ball down the field, but <a href="Steve_Hauschka" title="wikilink">Steve Hauschka</a> missed a 44-yard field goal as time expired on the clock. <a href="Joe_Flacco" title="wikilink">Joe Flacco</a> made 28 out of 43 passing attempts and threw for a career high 385 yards, and Ray Rice ran for 117 yards. The very next week they hosted the <a href="2009_Denver_Broncos_season" title="wikilink">Denver Broncos</a>, who were undefeated (6–0). After Hauschka kicked a pair of field goals in the 1st and 2nd quarters, the Broncos kicked off at the start of the 3rd quarter and the Ravens immediately returned it for a touchdown, giving the Ravens a 13–0 lead. They finished the game victorious, crushing the Broncos 30–7, handing Denver its first loss of the season.</p>

<p>The following week, they looked to avenge the week 5 loss to the Bengals. However, they were out-played on both sides of the ball, suffered a crucial miss by Hauschka, and lost 17–7.</p>

<p>In week 10, the Ravens visited the Cleveland Browns on <em><a href="Monday_Night_Football" title="wikilink">Monday Night Football</a></em> and shut out their divisional rivals 16–0 despite a slow offensive start. Steve Hauschka missed a field goal and had an extra point blocked, costing the Ravens four points. This led coach <a href="John_Harbaugh" title="wikilink">John Harbaugh</a> to release Hauschka and replace him with <a href="Billy_Cundiff" title="wikilink">Billy Cundiff</a>.</p>

<p>In week 11, the Ravens played their third undefeated opponent, the Colts, who were (9–0). They lost 17–15, failing to score a single touchdown. Cundiff went 5 for 6 on field goals, scoring the Ravens only points. Joe Flacco threw a late interception and after Ed Reed's fumbled attempt to lateral on a punt return, <a href="Peyton_Manning" title="wikilink">Peyton Manning</a> kneeled to seal the Colts' seventh consecutive victory against Baltimore. With this loss, the Ravens record stood at 5–5, ranking third in the AFC North.</p>

<p> The Ravens then beat the Steelers, who were playing without quarterback <a href="Ben_Roethlisberger" title="wikilink">Ben Roethlisberger</a> with an overtime field goal on <em><a href="NBC_Sunday_Night_Football" title="wikilink">Sunday Night Football</a></em>'. The next week, however, the Ravens lost to the <a href="Green_Bay_Packers" title="wikilink">Green Bay Packers</a> on ESPN Monday Night Football.</p>

<p>The Ravens then crushed two opponents from the <a href="NFC_North" title="wikilink">NFC North</a> at home, beating the <a href="Detroit_Lions" title="wikilink">Detroit Lions</a> 48–3 and the <a href="Chicago_Bears" title="wikilink">Chicago Bears</a> 31–7. The Ravens improved to 8–6, second in the AFC North, and in line for the fifth seed. They looked ahead to their division rivals, the Steelers, who were coming off a dramatic last-second win against the Packers. A win would give the Ravens a chance to clinch a playoff spot and would knock the Steelers out of contention. But the Ravens, who committed 11 penalties and blew several chances to put additional points on Pittsburgh, lost 23–20. The Ravens still had a shot at the playoffs with a week 17 victory, and made it defeating the <a href="Oakland_Raiders" title="wikilink">Oakland Raiders</a> 21–13.</p>

<p>In the playoffs, they faced the Patriots in the wild card round. The Ravens beat the Patriots 33–14, aided by <a href="Ray_Rice" title="wikilink">Ray Rice</a>'s 83-yard touchdown run on the first play from scrimmage, helping them to a 24–0 lead at the end of the first quarter. Advancing to the AFC divisional round, they next played Indianapolis. Two touchdowns late in the first half gave the Colts a 17–3 lead at halftime, and Baltimore miscues in the second half ensured the end of their season, by a 20–3 score.</p>
<h4 id="section-12">2010</h4>

<p>During the 2009–2010 offseason, the Ravens made some key additions to their offense by acquiring WR <a href="Anquan_Boldin" title="wikilink">Anquan Boldin</a> from the <a href="Arizona_Cardinals" title="wikilink">Arizona Cardinals</a> and free agent <a href="T._J._Houshmandzadeh" title="wikilink">T. J. Houshmandzadeh</a>, released after the preseason by the <a href="Seattle_Seahawks" title="wikilink">Seattle Seahawks</a>. They also added <a href="Donté_Stallworth" title="wikilink">Donté Stallworth</a>, who most last played for the <a href="Cleveland_Browns" title="wikilink">Cleveland Browns</a>, but was suspended for the 2009 season, and signed back-up quarterback <a href="Mark_Bulger" title="wikilink">Mark Bulger</a> who was released by the <a href="St._Louis_Rams" title="wikilink">St. Louis Rams</a> after the 1–15 2009 season. Stallworth broke his foot in the third preseason game and came back later in the season.  They also drafted tight ends <a href="Dennis_Pitta" title="wikilink">Dennis Pitta</a>, <a href="Ed_Dickson" title="wikilink">Ed Dickson</a>, defensive tackle <a href="Terrence_Cody" title="wikilink">Terrence Cody</a>, <a href="Arthur_Jones_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Arthur Jones</a>, linebacker <a href="Sergio_Kindle" title="wikilink">Sergio Kindle</a>, wide receiver <a href="David_Reed_(American_football)" title="wikilink">David Reed</a> and offensive tackle <a href="Ramon_Harewood" title="wikilink">Ramon Harewood</a> in the <a href="2010_NFL_Draft" title="wikilink">2010 NFL Draft</a>. On July 25, <a href="Sergio_Kindle" title="wikilink">Sergio Kindle</a> suffered a head trauma after falling down two flights of stairs in a home in Austin, Texas and was lost for the season. The new additions accounted for a combined 37 starts.</p>

<p>The Ravens finished the season at 12–4 but with a marginally worse divisional record (Steelers 5–1 divisionally versus the Ravens' 4–2). They then went on to defeat the <a href="2010_Kansas_City_Chiefs_season" title="wikilink">Kansas City Chiefs</a> 30–7 in the wild card round of the playoffs, running back Ray Rice becoming the first Raven running back to have a receiving touchdown in a playoff game. The Ravens would then lose to the <a href="2010_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season" title="wikilink">Steelers</a> 31–24 in the divisional playoffs. Leading at halftime 21–7, the Ravens then turned the ball over three times in the third quarter, in which gave the Steelers 14 points. Baltimore's season ended with a potential touchdown drop by <a href="Anquan_Boldin" title="wikilink">Anquan Boldin</a> and, later, another drop by <a href="T._J._Houshmandzadeh" title="wikilink">T. J. Houshmandzadeh</a> on 4th down, surrendering the game 31–24.</p>
<h4 id="section-13">2011</h4>

<p>After the <a href="2011_NFL_season" title="wikilink">2011 NFL season</a> labor dispute had ended, the Ravens had informed veterans <a href="Willis_McGahee" title="wikilink">Willis McGahee</a>, <a href="Todd_Heap" title="wikilink">Todd Heap</a>, <a href="Kelly_Gregg" title="wikilink">Kelly Gregg</a>, and <a href="Derrick_Mason" title="wikilink">Derrick Mason</a> that they would be cut in order to free up salary cap space.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Following these cuts, the Ravens acquired fullback <a href="Vonta_Leach" title="wikilink">Vonta Leach</a>, wide receiver <a href="Lee_Evans_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Lee Evans</a>, safety <a href="Bernard_Pollard" title="wikilink">Bernard Pollard</a>, and running back <a href="Ricky_Williams" title="wikilink">Ricky Williams</a>. During the pre season, the Baltimore Ravens signed Left tackle <a href="Bryant_McKinnie" title="wikilink">Bryant McKinnie</a> from the <a href="Minnesota_Vikings" title="wikilink">Minnesota Vikings</a>. On top of that the Ravens signed Pro bowl center <a href="Andre_Gurode" title="wikilink">Andre Gurode</a> from the <a href="Dallas_Cowboys" title="wikilink">Dallas Cowboys</a>. With the new signings, there was a reshuffle within the Offensive line. The signing of McKinnie forced <a href="Michael_Oher" title="wikilink">Michael Oher</a> over to the Right Tackle position, which in turn allowed <a href="Marshall_Yanda" title="wikilink">Marshall Yanda</a> to revert to his natural Right Guard position. The Ravens finished their pre season 3–1, with a loss to the <a href="Philadelphia_Eagles" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Eagles</a>, and victories over the <a href="Washington_Redskins" title="wikilink">Washington Redskins</a>, the <a href="Kansas_City_Chiefs" title="wikilink">Kansas City Chiefs</a>, and the <a href="Atlanta_Falcons" title="wikilink">Atlanta Falcons</a>.</p>

<p>2011 marked one of the most successful seasons in Baltimore Ravens franchise history. The Ravens started their campaign with a big 35–7 victory at home over their rivals the <a href="Pittsburgh_Steelers" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>. Other key victories included a 34–17 victory over the <a href="New_York_Jets" title="wikilink">New York Jets</a> in week three, a week six 29–14 victory over the <a href="Houston_Texans" title="wikilink">Houston Texans</a>, and a week nine win over the Steelers, this would be the first time since 2006 that the Ravens would sweep Pittsburgh in the <a href="AFC_North" title="wikilink">AFC North</a> division.</p>

<p>The Ravens went on and had a big win over the <a href="San_Francisco_49ers" title="wikilink">San Francisco 49ers</a> in a week twelve Thursday night thanksgiving game. This was a game where Ravens coach <a href="John_Harbaugh" title="wikilink">John Harbaugh</a> would face off against his brother <a href="Jim_Harbaugh" title="wikilink">Jim Harbaugh</a> who had just taken over as head coach of the 49ers in the 2011 season. The Ravens would go on to end a 49ers win streak in a final score of 16–6. The Ravens recorded a franchise record of nine sacks on 49ers quarterback <a href="Alex_Smith" title="wikilink">Alex Smith</a>, three coming from Ravens linebacker <a href="Terrell_Suggs" title="wikilink">Terrell Suggs</a>.   The Ravens went into the final week of the regular season already assured of a play off place at 11–4, but were tied with the Steelers record wise, and so they had to beat the <a href="Cincinnati_Bengals" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Bengals</a> on the road, in order to clinch the AFC North division for the first time since 2006. The Ravens defeated the Bengals for the second time in the 2011 regular season by a score of 24–16. The victory sealed the AFC North crown, a season 12–4 record, and a first round bye in the playoffs, which in turn sent both the Steelers and the Bengals on road in the wildcard playoff games – which both rivals lost to the <a href="Denver_Broncos" title="wikilink">Denver Broncos</a>, and the Texans, respectively.</p>

<p>The Ravens accomplished a number of significant achievements during the 2011 season, finishing 6–0 in the division, 6–0 against 2012 playoff teams, and 8–0 at home. The Ravens went into the <a href="2011–12_NFL_playoffs" title="wikilink">2012 NFL playoffs</a> with high expectations, however there were underlying worries, with what many considered to be inconsistent performances throughout the season by starting quarterback <a href="Joe_Flacco" title="wikilink">Joe Flacco</a> and the Ravens offense – which many put the blame on for the four questionable road losses that came against teams they were expected to beat, the <a href="Tennessee_Titans" title="wikilink">Tennessee Titans</a>, <a href="Jacksonville_Jaguars" title="wikilink">Jacksonville Jaguars</a>, <a href="Seattle_Seahawks" title="wikilink">Seattle Seahawks</a>, and <a href="San_Diego_Chargers" title="wikilink">San Diego Chargers</a>.</p>

<p>The Texans would end up beating the Bengals in the wild card playoff round, which meant that they would face the Ravens in the divisional playoff game. The Ravens won the game 20–13 in a defensive struggle, <a href="Ed_Reed" title="wikilink">Ed Reed</a> would intercept a pass from the Texans rookie quarterback <a href="T._J._Yates" title="wikilink">T. J. Yates</a> in a fourth quarter offensive drive by the Texans, which ended up being the Texans last realistic shot at scoring to tie the game. Despite the victory over the Texans, a significant amount of sports media questioned the Ravens' offensive capability going into the AFC championship playoff round, after another proposed poor performance by the Ravens offense and <a href="Joe_Flacco" title="wikilink">Joe Flacco</a> according to certain sports analysts.</p>

<p>The Ravens and <a href="New_England_Patriots" title="wikilink">New England Patriots</a> played for a spot in the <a href="Super_Bowl" title="wikilink">Super Bowl</a>. After a close 3 quarters which saw the ball being turned over several times, <a href="Tom_Brady" title="wikilink">Tom Brady</a> leaped over the goal line on a 4th and 1 to put the Patriots ahead 23–20. After another couple of turnovers on both ends the Ravens marched down the field with under a minute to go. Joe Flacco threw a pass to <a href="Lee_Evans_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Lee Evans</a> with 38 seconds left, who appeared to catch it for the winning touchdown but the ball was knocked out by Patriots defensive back <a href="Sterling_Moore" title="wikilink">Sterling Moore</a>, resulting in an incomplete pass. After Joe Flacco threw a dropped pass to Lee Evans, <a href="Billy_Cundiff" title="wikilink">Billy Cundiff</a> came out onto the field with 15 seconds to go to try and tie the game up with a 32-yard field goal. The kick went well to the left of the Patriots' goal post, and New England advanced to <a href="Super_Bowl_XLVI" title="wikilink">Super Bowl XLVI</a> for a rematch with the <a href="New_York_Giants" title="wikilink">New York Giants</a> in <a href="Super_Bowl_XLII" title="wikilink">Super Bowl XLII</a>.</p>

<p>The inaugural <a href="2011_NFL_Honors" title="wikilink">NFL Honors</a> ceremony was held on Super Bowl's eve.

<p>  Despite early injuries that led to struggles on the defensive side of the football, the Ravens jumped out to a 9–2 start thanks in part to a high powered no-huddle offense led by <a href="Joe_Flacco" title="wikilink">Joe Flacco</a>. Needing just a single win to secure a second straight division title, the Ravens went on a three-game losing streak, highlighted by the firing of offensive coordinator <a href="Cam_Cameron" title="wikilink">Cam Cameron</a>, promotion of quarterback coach <a href="Jim_Caldwell_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Jim Caldwell</a> to offensive coordinator, and a 34–17 loss at home to <a href="Peyton_Manning" title="wikilink">Peyton Manning</a> and the <a href="Denver_Broncos" title="wikilink">Denver Broncos</a> on December 16. Regardless, the Ravens clinched their fifth straight playoff berth after the Steelers lost to the Dallas Cowboys. Despite making the playoffs, this slump led some media outlets to questions the Ravens ability to win football games, but after making a statement with a decisive 33–14 victory over the Super Bowl champion <a href="New_York_Giants" title="wikilink">New York Giants</a> and securing back to back division titles for the first time in franchise history, they finished with a regular season record of 10–6 and a rare home playoff game in the Wildcard Round.</p>

<p>The 2012 season also saw long-serving linebacker Ray Lewis announce his retirement heading into the AFC Wildcard game against the <a href="Indianapolis_Colts" title="wikilink">Indianapolis Colts</a>. Lewis tore his triceps midway through October in his 17th season with the Ravens after Baltimore selected him with the 26th overall pick in the 1996 NFL Draft. The unusual timing of the announcement was criticized by some, such as former New York Giant <a href="Amani_Toomer" title="wikilink">Amani Toomer</a> who accused Lewis of being selfish.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Nonetheless, many, to include team mate <a href="Terrell_Suggs" title="wikilink">Terrell Suggs</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> considered the timing to as a "stroke of genius<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> in regards to Lewis' strong motivational presence, and credited Lewis with providing the necessary inspiration for the team in what would prove to be a Super Bowl victory season. They defeated the Colts during the <a href="2012-13_NFL_Playoffs" title="wikilink">Wild Card round</a> on January 6, 2013 at <a href="M&amp;T;_Bank_Stadium" title="wikilink">M&amp;T; Bank Stadium</a>, with Ray Lewis celebrating his final game at home with his trademark dance both at the start of the game as he was introduced and on the final play of the game when he was brought back onto the field. With the defeat of the Colts in the Wildcard round, the Ravens were primed to face the Denver Broncos at Mile High Stadium in Denver in the AFC divisional round. Labeled as huge underdogs coming into the game, especially considering the previous thrashing that was dealt against them by the aforementioned Denver Broncos in a home loss at M&amp;T; Bank Stadium on December 16th, 2012. The Ravens, however, shocked the sports world as well as many analysts and fans of football alike, by defeating the Peyton Manning led <a href="Denver_Broncos" title="wikilink">Denver Broncos</a> in the second overtime, 38–35, in a spectacular divisional round matchup on Saturday, January 12, 2013. It looked as though they had lost the game as they got the ball with just over a minute left on their own twenty-three-yard line, but a clutch 70-yard touchdown pass, known colloquially as "The <a href="Mile_High_Miracle" title="wikilink">Mile High Miracle</a>", from <a href="Joe_Flacco" title="wikilink">Joe Flacco</a> to <a href="Jacoby_Jones" title="wikilink">Jacoby Jones</a> sent the game to overtime. In overtime, an interception of <a href="Peyton_Manning" title="wikilink">Peyton Manning</a> by <a href="Corey_Graham" title="wikilink">Corey Graham</a> (who had already returned one interception for a touchdown earlier in the game) put the Ravens in field position to kick the winning field goal. The win vaulted the Ravens to play for the AFC Conference Championship against the <a href="New_England_Patriots" title="wikilink">New England Patriots</a> on Sunday, January 20, 2013; the Ravens won 28–13 after shutting out <a href="Tom_Brady" title="wikilink">Tom Brady</a> and the New England offense in the second half, completely dismantling any offensive attempt(s) thereafter. The win placed the Ravens in <a href="Super_Bowl_XLVII" title="wikilink">Super Bowl XLVII</a> against the <a href="San_Francisco_49ers" title="wikilink">San Francisco 49ers</a> on February 3, 2013. The Ravens opened the game in thrilling fashion as their opening drive of the game ended with a touchdown pass from Super Bowl MVP Joe Flacco to wide receiver Anquan Boldin. Flacco threw two second-quarter touchdown passes as Baltimore took a 21-6 lead into halftime. After halftime, the Ravens received the kickoff from the 49ers, and Jacoby Jones returned the kickoff for a record setting 108-yard touchdown. However, soon after the Jacoby Jones touchdown, a power-outage at the stadium led to a 34-minute stoppage in play due to inefficiencies in lighting, on-field visibility, and electrical equipment. After power was restored, the 49ers regained composure and came storming back, scoring 17 unanswered points. The 49ers had a final chance to take the lead late in the game, but a goal-line stand by the Ravens with less than two minutes remaining sealed the contest as the Baltimore Ravens won Super Bowl XLVII 34–31. Super Bowl XLVII has also been dubbed the "Harbaugh Bowl" since the 49ers were coached by <a href="Jim_Harbaugh" title="wikilink">Jim Harbaugh</a>, the brother of Ravens coach <a href="John_Harbaugh" title="wikilink">John Harbaugh</a>. The Ravens returned to Baltimore to celebrate with their fans on Tuesday, February 5. A parade saw upwards of 300,000 people line the streets of downtown Baltimore while another 80,000 packed M&amp;T; Bank Stadium to cheer the team. Speeches by owner Steve Biscotti, Coach Harbaugh, Ray Lewis and Ed Reed were met by fans with standing ovations.</p>
<h4 id="section-14">2013</h4>

<p>By virtue of winning <a href="Super_Bowl_XLVII" title="wikilink">Super Bowl XLVII</a>, the Ravens were scheduled to host the <a href="NFL_Kickoff_Game" title="wikilink">Kickoff Game</a> on Thursday, September 5, 2013; however, due to a scheduling conflict with the Baltimore Orioles (with whom they share a parking lot) and the NFL's refusal to move the game to a different night, the Baltimore Ravens were the first Super Bowl Champion in 10 years not to host the following year's Kickoff Game. The 2013 <a href="NFL_Kickoff_Game" title="wikilink">Kickoff Game</a> was played at <a href="Sports_Authority_Field_at_Mile_High" title="wikilink">Sports Authority Field at Mile High</a> when the Ravens visited the <a href="Denver_Broncos" title="wikilink">Denver Broncos</a>.</p>

<p>After losing linebacker <a href="Ray_Lewis" title="wikilink">Ray Lewis</a> and center <a href="Matt_Birk" title="wikilink">Matt Birk</a> to retirement, the Ravens' roster underwent significant changes throughout the 2013 offseason. Free agent linebacker <a href="Paul_Kruger_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Paul Kruger</a> signed with the Cleveland Browns, linebacker <a href="Dannell_Ellerbe" title="wikilink">Dannell Ellerbe</a> signed with the Miami Dolphins, cornerback <a href="Cary_Williams" title="wikilink">Cary Williams</a> signed with the Philadelphia Eagles, and safety <a href="Ed_Reed" title="wikilink">Ed Reed</a> signed with the Houston Texans. Additionally, safety <a href="Bernard_Pollard" title="wikilink">Bernard Pollard</a> was released due to salary cap reasons and later signed with the Tennessee Titans. Wide receiver <a href="Anquan_Boldin" title="wikilink">Anquan Boldin</a> was traded to the San Francisco 49ers for a sixth-round draft pick. The Ravens made some offseason additions as well, signing defensive linemen <a href="Chris_Canty_(defensive_lineman)" title="wikilink">Chris Canty</a> and <a href="Marcus_Spears_(defensive_end)" title="wikilink">Marcus Spears</a> as well as signing key free agent linebacker <a href="Elvis_Dumervil" title="wikilink">Elvis Dumervil</a> and safety <a href="Michael_Huff" title="wikilink">Michael Huff</a>. As well as drafting first round pick Safety Matt Elam, second round pick Linebacker Arthur Brown, third round pick Defensive Tackle Brandon Williams, and fourth round pick "hybrid" Fullback Kyle Juszczyk among others. Unfortunately during training camp the Ravens lost another key player, tight-end <a href="Dennis_Pitta" title="wikilink">Dennis Pitta</a> for the entire season (who was primed for an even greater 2013 season). During a routine drill, he suffered a dislocated/fractured hip after colliding with another teammate (James Ihedigbo) at the back of the end zone. In response, during August, they re-signed wide receiver <a href="Brandon_Stokley" title="wikilink">Brandon Stokley</a>, whom they drafted in 1999, and signed former Colts and <a href="Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers" title="wikilink">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> tight end, <a href="Dallas_Clark" title="wikilink">Dallas Clark</a>.</p>

<p>The season started out badly for the Ravens, as they were defeated by the Broncos in their season opener, thus becoming the second Super Bowl Champion to lose the NFL kickoff game. This meant that they held the first loss of the season, breaking a record for the most points allowed by the defense and ending a 75 game streak of holding a .500 or better win-loss ratio. They would rebound in Week 2 with a 14–6 victory over their division rival, the <a href="Cleveland_Browns" title="wikilink">Cleveland Browns</a>. The following week the Ravens took on the unbeaten Houston Texans at home; this time they would face a familiar face in safety Ed Reed, who played for them for 12 seasons. After a strong showing by the defense, which only allowed 9 points, the Ravens clobbered the Texans 30–9. In Week 4, the Ravens struggled against the Buffalo Bills as Joe Flacco threw a career high 5 interceptions. The Ravens fell to the Bills 23–20. At 2–2, the Ravens hit the road to Miami to take on the Dolphins. Although they faced a 13–6 deficit at halftime, the offense rallied to score 17 consecutive points giving the Ravens a 23–13 lead in the 4th quarter. However, Miami answered right back with 10 points of their own, tying the game at 23 with 8:03 left. Justin Tucker then kicked a 44-yard field goal with 1:42 left to give the Ravens a 26–23 lead. After the Dolphins comeback attempt stalled, Caleb Sturgis missed a field goal late, giving the Ravens the win. The Ravens then returned home to take on the Green Bay Packers. The offense struggled early, as the Ravens were shut out in the first half. Trailing 16-3 in the 4th quarter Joe Flacco found Jacoby Jones in the end zone for an 11 yard touchdown pass to reduce the deficit to 16-10. After another Packers field goal, the Ravens faced a 19-10 deficit with 4:17 remaining. Joe Flacco was able to find Dallas Clark in the end zone for an 18-yard touchdown pass, making it 19-17. However, the Packers were able to seal the victory by picking up first downs and running out the clock. The following week, the Ravens would fall to their rivals, the Pittsburgh Steelers 16-19 on a last second field goal by Steelers kicker <a href="Shaun_Suisham" title="wikilink">Shaun Suisham</a>. The following week, the Ravens would lose 18-24 to the Cleveland Browns for the first time under John Harbaugh. Facing the probable end to their season at that point, the Ravens would snap their three-game skid with a win against their first-place division rivals, the <a href="2013_Cincinnati_Bengals_season" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Bengals</a> 20-17 in overtime. The following week, the Ravens were scheduled to face the <a href="Chicago_Bears" title="wikilink">Chicago Bears</a>. The game was delayed for two hours due to a heavy storm. The Ravens would, however, fall to the Bears 20-23 in overtime. They would rebound the next week in a home game against the New York Jets. On <a href="NFL_on_Thanksgiving_Day" title="wikilink">Thanksgiving</a>, the Ravens would defeat the Steelers 22-20 at home, avenging their Week 7 loss to them, and improving to 2-0 on Thanksgiving games. In Week 14 the Ravens would beat the Minnesota Vikings 26-29. In Week 15, the Ravens would beat the Detroit Lions at Ford Field 18-16 off Justin Tucker's 6 field goals, including a 61-yarder that proved to be the game-clinching score followed by a <a href="Matthew_Stafford" title="wikilink">Matthew Stafford</a> interception. In Week 16 the Ravens would lose at home to the New England Patriots 41-7 making it the second worst home loss in Ravens history. In Week 17 the Ravens faced the Cincinnati Bengals. The defense forced 4 interceptions on Andy Dalton but it wasn't enough for the offense to take advantage of. Baltimore tied the game 17-17 in the second half, but surrendered 17 unanswered points to the Bengals, thus ending their season at 8-8 and missing the playoffs for the first time since 2007.</p>
<h4 id="section-15">2014</h4>

<p>On January 27, 2014, the Ravens hired former <a href="Houston_Texans" title="wikilink">Houston Texans</a> head coach <a href="Gary_Kubiak" title="wikilink">Gary Kubiak</a> to be their new offensive coordinator after <a href="Jim_Caldwell_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Jim Caldwell</a> accepted the new available head coaching job with the <a href="Detroit_Lions" title="wikilink">Detroit Lions</a>. In the <a href="2014_NFL_Draft" title="wikilink">2014 NFL Draft</a>, the Ravens selected <a href="C._J._Mosley_(linebacker)" title="wikilink">C.J. Mosley</a> with the 17th overall pick. During the offseason, the Ravens signed former <a href="Carolina_Panthers" title="wikilink">Carolina Panthers</a> wide receiver <a href="Steve_Smith,_Sr." title="wikilink">Steve Smith</a> to a 3-year contract. They also signed tight end <a href="Owen_Daniels" title="wikilink">Owen Daniels</a> and running back <a href="Justin_Forsett" title="wikilink">Justin Forsett</a>, as they played for Kubiak in Houston and would seemingly fit in Kubiak's new system. On February 15, 2014, star running back Ray Rice and his fiancée Janay Palmer were arrested and charged with assault after a physical altercation at <a href="Revel_Atlantic_City" title="wikilink">Revel Casino</a> in <a href="Atlantic_City,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Atlantic City, New Jersey</a>. Celebrity news website <a class="uri" href="TMZ" title="wikilink">TMZ</a> posted a video of Rice dragging Palmer's body out of an elevator after apparently knocking her out. For the incident, Rice was initially suspended for the first two games of the <a href="2014_NFL_season" title="wikilink">2014 NFL season</a> on July 25, 2014, which led to widespread criticism of the NFL.</p>

<p>In Week 1, on September 7, the Baltimore Ravens lost to the <a href="Cincinnati_Bengals" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Bengals</a>, 23-16. The next day, on September 8, 2014, <a class="uri" href="TMZ" title="wikilink">TMZ</a> released additional footage from an elevator camera showing Rice punching Palmer. The Baltimore Ravens terminated Rice's contract as a result, and was later indefinitely suspended by the NFL. Although starting out 0-1 for two straight seasons and having received unwanted media attention for the Ray Rice incident, on September 11, 2014, the Ravens rallied back and beat the <a href="Pittsburgh_Steelers" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> 26-6 on <a href="Thursday_Night_Football" title="wikilink">Thursday Night Football</a>, to improve to 1-1 . On the Sunday after the Thursday night victory, the Ravens headed to Cleveland for a third straight division game with the Browns. In a tough fought game, the Baltimore Ravens won 23-21 with a game-winning 32-yard field goal by Justin Tucker as time expired. On September 28, the Ravens hosted the Carolina Panthers, and in a fabulous offensive performance, defeated the Carolina Panthers 38-10; with this victory the Ravens have defeated every visiting franchise at least once at home (and at M&amp;T; Bank Stadium). The very next week, the Ravens traveled to Indianapolis to play the Colts in Week 5. However, three turnovers and QB <a href="Joe_Flacco" title="wikilink">Joe Flacco</a> being sacked four times resulted in a 20-13 loss, breaking the 3-2 Ravens win streak. In week 6, Joe Flacco led the Ravens to an impressive 48-17 victory over the <a href="Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers" title="wikilink">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a>. Flacco threw 5 touchdown passes in the first 16:03 of the game, an NFL record, to put the contest out of reach early in the 2nd quarter. In Week 7, the Ravens hosted the <a href="Atlanta_Falcons" title="wikilink">Atlanta Falcons</a> and won 29-7. The next week, the Ravens traveled to Cincinnati for a key divisional game. Both defenses forced key turnovers in a game that no passing touchdowns were thrown. In the waning seconds of the 4th quarter as Baltimore trailed, Flacco threw an 80-yard touchdown pass to Steve Smith that seemingly won the game. However, Smith was controversially called for offensive pass interference on Bengals safety <a href="George_Iloka" title="wikilink">George Iloka</a>, who looked to have flopped, that negated the touchdown. The Ravens ended up losing 27-24 and being swept by the Bengals for the first time since 2009. The next week, the Ravens traveled to Pittsburgh for another key division match. Two unfortunate turnovers led to an offensive surge by the Steelers and Ben Roethlisberger throwing six touchdowns on an injury riddled Baltimore secondary, humbling the Ravens 43-23. Afterwards, the Ravens made some changes to their secondary, cutting cornerbacks <a href="Chykie_Brown" title="wikilink">Chykie Brown</a> and <a href="Dominique_Franks" title="wikilink">Dominique Franks</a>, and signing former Ravens cornerback <a href="Danny_Gorrer" title="wikilink">Danny Gorrer</a>. The Ravens hosted the Tennessee Titans in Week 10, winning 21-7, and going into their bye week 6-4. After the bye week, the Ravens traveled down to New Orleans for an interconference battle with the <a href="New_Orleans_Saints" title="wikilink">New Orleans Saints</a> on <a href="Monday_Night_Football" title="wikilink">Monday Night Football</a>. In the third quarter, with the score tied 17-17, new Ravens free safety <a href="Will_Hill" title="wikilink">Will Hill</a> stepped in front of a <a href="Drew_Brees" title="wikilink">Drew Brees</a> pass and returned it 44 yards for a touchdown. Running back Justin Forsett had a career night, running for 182 yards and 2 touchdowns, as the Ravens won 34-27, improving their record to 7-4 and a 4-0 sweep of the NFC south. In Week 13 against the <a href="San_Diego_Chargers" title="wikilink">San Diego Chargers</a>, the Ravens loss in heartbreaking fashion 34-33, allowing the Chargers to score 21 points in the 4th quarter. The Ravens rebounded the next week against the Miami Dolphins winning 27-10, and the defense sacking Dolphins quarterback <a href="Ryan_Tannehill" title="wikilink">Ryan Tannehill</a> six times. The defense was even more dominant against the Jacksonville Jaguars in a 20-12 win, sacking rookie quarterback <a href="Blake_Bortles" title="wikilink">Blake Bortles</a> eight times. In Week 16, the Ravens traveled to Houston to take on the Texans. In one of Joe Flacco's worst performances, the offense sputtered against the Houston defense and Flacco threw three interceptions, including two inside the Ravens own 20 yard line, falling to the Texans 25-13. With their playoff chances and season hanging in the balance, the Ravens took on the Browns in Week 17 at home. After three quarters had gone by and down 10-3, Joe Flacco led the Ravens on a comeback scoring 17 unanswered points in the 4th quarter, winning 20-10. With the win, and the Kansas City Chiefs defeating the San Diego Chargers, the Ravens clinched their sixth playoff berth in seven seasons, and the first since winning Super Bowl XLVII.</p>

<p>In the wildcard playoff game, the Ravens won 30-17 against their divisional rivals, the <a href="2014_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, at <a href="Heinz_Field" title="wikilink">Heinz Field</a>. The next in the Divisional round, the Ravens faced the <a href="2014_New_England_Patriots_season" title="wikilink">New England Patriots</a>. Despite a strong offensive effort and having a 14-point lead twice in the game, the Ravens were defeated by the Patriots 35-31, ending their season.</p>

<h3 id="pittsburgh-steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</h3>

<p>By far the team's biggest rival is the <a href="Pittsburgh_Steelers" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>. Pittsburgh and Baltimore are separated by a less-than-five-hour drive along <a href="Interstate_70" title="wikilink">Interstate 70</a>. Both teams are known for their hard-hitting physical style of play. They play at least twice a year in the <a href="AFC_North" title="wikilink">AFC North</a>, and have met four times in the playoffs. Games between these two teams usually come down to the wire as most within the last 5 years have come down to 3 points or less. The rivalry is considered one of the most significant and intense in the <a class="uri" href="NFL" title="wikilink">NFL</a> today.</p>
<h3 id="indianapolis-colts">Indianapolis Colts</h3>

<p>Although the Steelers rivalry is based on mutual respect and antagonism for each other, the Ravens' rivalry with the <a href="Indianapolis_Colts" title="wikilink">Indianapolis Colts</a> is fueled by the fans' animosity towards the organization, not contention between the players. This is due to the fact that the then-Colts owner, Robert Irsay, while publicly still in negotiations with the city for the stadium improvements that he was demanding, snuck the Colts out of Baltimore in the middle of the night to take them to Indianapolis. During Ravens home games the scoreboard lists the away team simply as "Away" or "Indy" rather than the team name that is traditionally used for the visiting opponent. The PA announcer will also refer to the Colts as the Indianapolis Professional Football Team; although on January 6, 2013 the scoreboard at the playoff game between the Baltimore Ravens and Indianapolis Colts at M&amp;T; Bank Stadium listed the away team as "Colts". The Indianapolis Colts hold an all-time 9–4 advantage over the Baltimore Ravens, including a 2–1 advantage in the playoffs.</p>
<h3 id="other-afc-north-rivals">Other AFC North Rivals</h3>

<p> The Ravens also have divisional rivalries with the <a href="Cleveland_Browns" title="wikilink">Cleveland Browns</a> and <a href="Cincinnati_Bengals" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Bengals</a>.</p>

<p>The reactivated <a href="Cleveland_Browns" title="wikilink">Cleveland Browns</a> and their fans maintain a hatred of Baltimore's team due to its move from Cleveland. The rivalry with the Browns has been very one-sided; Baltimore holds an advantage of 22-8 against Cleveland.</p>

<p>The rivalry with Cincinnati has been closer, standing at 20-19 in favor of the Ravens after the 2014 season.</p>
<h3 id="new-england-patriots">New England Patriots</h3>

<p>The Ravens first met the <a href="New_England_Patriots" title="wikilink">New England Patriots</a> in 1996, but the rivalry truly started in 2007 when the Ravens suffered a bitter 27–24 loss in the Patriots <a href="2007_New_England_Patriots_season" title="wikilink">quest for perfection</a>. The rivalry began to escalate in 2009 when the Patriots beat the Ravens 27–21 in a game that involved a confrontation between Patriots quarterback <a href="Tom_Brady" title="wikilink">Tom Brady</a> and Ravens linebacker <a href="Terrell_Suggs" title="wikilink">Terrell Suggs</a>. Both players would go on to take verbal shots at each other through the media after the game.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The Ravens faced the Patriots in a 2009 AFC wild card playoff game and won 33–14; the Ravens ran the ball for more than 250 yards.</p>

<p>The Ravens faced the Patriots in Week 6 of the 2010 season; the Ravens ended up losing 23–20 in overtime; the game caused controversy due to a hit to the helmet of tight end <a href="Todd_Heap" title="wikilink">Todd Heap</a> by Patriots safety <a href="Brandon_Meriweather" title="wikilink">Brandon Meriweather</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>The Ravens played the Patriots for the third consecutive season, in the 2011 AFC championship game in which the Ravens lost 23–20. The rivalry reached a new level of friction with this, the second career playoff game between the two clubs. The Ravens clawed to a 20–16 lead in the fourth quarter but Patriots quarterback <a href="Tom_Brady" title="wikilink">Tom Brady</a> dove into the end zone to make the score 23–20 with around 11 minutes remaining; this proved to be the winning touchdown. On the Ravens last possession of the game, quarterback <a href="Joe_Flacco" title="wikilink">Joe Flacco</a> threw a pass to wide receiver <a href="Lee_Evans_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Lee Evans</a> in the corner of the end zone which looked to be the game winning touchdown, before a last second strip by <a href="Sterling_Moore" title="wikilink">Sterling Moore</a> forced the ball from the hands of Evans, forcing the game to be decided on a last minute field goal by Ravens <a class="uri" href="placekicker" title="wikilink">placekicker</a> <a href="Billy_Cundiff" title="wikilink">Billy Cundiff</a>. With eleven seconds remaining on the clock, the kicker missed the 32-yard field goal attempt by a very wide margin, allowing the Patriots to kill the clock on their way to <a href="Super_Bowl_XLVI" title="wikilink">Super Bowl XLVI</a>.</p>

<p>The Ravens' first regular-season win over the Patriots came on September 23, 2012. The game was emotional as receiver <a href="Torrey_Smith" title="wikilink">Torrey Smith</a> was competing following the death of his brother in a motorcycle accident just the night before.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Smith caught two touchdowns in a back and forth game; the Ravens erased a 13–0 lead in the first half and led 14–13, but the Patriots scored at the end of the second quarter for a 20–14 lead. The lead changed twice in the third quarter and the Patriots led 30–21 in the fourth, but the Ravens scored on Smith's second touchdown catch. The Ravens were stopped on fourth down but the Patriots had to punt; in the final two minutes a pass interference penalty on <a href="Devin_McCourty" title="wikilink">Devin McCourty</a> put the ball at the Patriots 7-yard line; new Ravens kicker <a href="Justin_Tucker" title="wikilink">Justin Tucker</a> booted a 27-yard field goal on the final play; the ball sailed directly over the upright and was ruled good; the quality of officiating by replacement referees caused controversy as <a href="Bill_Belichick" title="wikilink">Bill Belichick</a> angrily reached for one of the referees as they were leaving the field, leading to a $50,000 fine later that week.</p>

<p>The two teams met again on January 20, 2013 in the AFC Championship, where the Ravens won 28–13. The Patriots led at halftime, 13–7, but the Ravens' defense gave up no points in the second half. It was the first time ever that Tom Brady lost a game at home after leading at halftime, and the first time a road team beat the Patriots in the AFC Championship.</p>

<p>On December 22, 2013 the teams met again, this rematch of the AFC championship game was a mismatch from the outset. New England took a 17-0 lead early in the second quarter and never let up behind a defense that forced four turnovers and had four sacks. New England would go on to win the game 41-7.</p>

<p>On January 10, 2015, the two teams would meet in the Divisional Round of the playoffs. Unlike the previous meeting, the Ravens put up a strong offensive performance, leading by 14 points twice in the game. However, Tom Brady would bring the Patriots back by attacking the Ravens vulnerable secondary and taking a 35-31 lead late in the 4th quarter. Joe Flacco would drive to the Patriots side of the field with under two minutes to play in regulation. However a key interception by Flacco due to a misplay on the ball by Torrey Smith essentially sealed the game in the Patriots favor to send them to the AFC Championship.</p>
<h2 id="logo-controversy">Logo controversy</h2>

<p>  The team's first helmet logo, used from 1996 through 1998, featured raven wings outspread from a shield displaying a letter <em>B</em> framed by the word <em>Ravens</em> overhead and a <a href="cross_bottony" title="wikilink">cross bottony</a> underneath. The <a href="United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fourth_Circuit" title="wikilink">US Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals</a> affirmed a jury verdict that the logo <a href="Copyright_infringement" title="wikilink">infringed</a> on a <a class="uri" href="copyright" title="wikilink">copyright</a> retained by Frederick E. Bouchat, an amateur artist and security guard in Maryland, but that he was entitled to only three dollars in damages from the NFL.</p>

<p>Bouchat had submitted his design to the Maryland Stadium Authority by fax after learning that Baltimore was to acquire an NFL team. He was not credited for the design when the logo was announced. Bouchat sued the team, claiming to be the designer of the emblem; representatives of the team asserted that the image had been designed independently. The court ruled in favor of Bouchat, noting that team owner Modell had access to Bouchat's work. Bouchat's fax had gone to John Moag, the Maryland Stadium Authority chairman, whose office was located in the same building as Modell's.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Bouchat ultimately was not awarded monetary compensation in the damages phase of the case.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>The <em><a href="Baltimore_Sun" title="wikilink">Baltimore Sun</a></em> ran a poll showing three designs for new helmet logos. Fans participating in the poll expressed a preference for a raven's head in profile over other designs. <a href="Art_Modell" title="wikilink">Art Modell</a> announced that he would honor this preference but still wanted a letter <em>B</em> to appear somewhere in the design. The new Ravens logo featured a raven's head in profile with the letter superimposed. The secondary logo is a shield that honors Baltimore's history of <a class="uri" href="heraldry" title="wikilink">heraldry</a>. Alternating Calvert and Crossland emblems (seen also in the <a href="flag_of_Maryland" title="wikilink">flag of Maryland</a> and the <a href="flag_of_Baltimore" title="wikilink">flag of Baltimore</a>) are interlocked with stylized letters <em>B</em> and <em>R</em>.</p>
<h2 id="uniforms">Uniforms</h2>

<p>The design of the Ravens uniform has remained essentially unchanged since the team's inaugural season in 1996. Art Modell admitted to ESPN’s Roy Firestone that the Ravens’ colors, introduced in early 1996, were inspired by the <a href="Northwestern_Wildcats" title="wikilink">Northwestern Wildcats</a> 1995 dream season.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Helmets are <a class="uri" href="black" title="wikilink">black</a> with <a class="uri" href="purple" title="wikilink">purple</a> "talon" stripes rising from the facemask to the crown. Players normally wear purple jerseys at home and white jerseys on the road. In 1996 the team wore black pants with a single large white stripe for all games. At home games the combination of black pants with purple jersey made the Ravens the first NFL team to wear dark colors head to calf. A number of NFL teams have since donned the look, beginning with the all-black home uniform worn in three games by the 2001 <a href="New_Orleans_Saints" title="wikilink">New Orleans Saints</a>.</p>

<p>In 1997 the Ravens opted for a more classic NFL look with white pants sporting stripes in purple and black. The white pants were worn with both home and road jerseys. The road uniform (white pants with white jerseys) was worn by the Ravens in the 2000 Super Bowl.</p>

<p>In the 2002 season the Ravens began the practice of wearing white jerseys for the home opener and, occasionally, other early games in the season that have a 1:00 kickoff. Since John Harbaugh became the head coach in 2008, the Ravens have also worn their white jerseys at home for preseason games.</p>

<p>In November 2004 the team introduced an alternate uniform design featuring black jerseys and solid black pants with black socks. The all-black uniform was first worn for a home game against the <a href="Cleveland_Browns" title="wikilink">Cleveland Browns</a>, entitled "Pitch Black" night, that resulted in a Ravens win. The uniform has since been worn for select prime-time national game broadcasts and other games of significance.</p>

<p>The Ravens began wearing black pants again with the white jersey in 2008. On December 7, 2008, during a Sunday Night Football game against the <a href="Washington_Redskins" title="wikilink">Washington Redskins</a>, the Ravens introduced a new combination of black jersey with white pants. It was believed to be due to the fact that John Harbaugh doesn't like the "blackout" look.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> However, on December 19, 2010, the Ravens wore their black jerseys and black pants in a 30–24 victory over the New Orleans Saints.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>On December 5, 2010, the Ravens reverted to the black pants with the purple jerseys versus the Pittsburgh Steelers during NBC's Sunday Night Football telecast. The Ravens lost to the Steelers 13–10. They wore the same look again for their game against the Cleveland Browns on December 24, 2011, and they won, 20–14. They wore this combination a third time against the <a href="Houston_Texans" title="wikilink">Houston Texans</a> on January 15, 2012 in the AFC Divisional playoff. They won 20–13. They would again wear this combination on January 6, 2013, during the <a href="2012-13_NFL_playoffs" title="wikilink">AFC Wild Card playoff</a> and what turned out to be Ray Lewis' final home game, where they defeated the Indianapolis Colts 24-9.</p>

<p>From their inaugural season until 2006, the Ravens wore white cleats with their uniforms; they switched to black cleats in 2007.</p>
<h2 id="marching-band">Marching band</h2>

<p>The team marching band is called <a href="Baltimore's_Marching_Ravens" title="wikilink">Baltimore's Marching Ravens</a>. They began as the Colts' marching band and have operated continuously from September 7, 1947 to the present. They helped campaign for football to return to Baltimore after the Colts moved. Because they stayed in Baltimore after the Colts left, the band is nicknamed "the band that would not die" and were the subject of <a href="The_Band_that_Wouldn't_Die" title="wikilink">an episode</a> of ESPN's <em><a href="30_for_30" title="wikilink">30 for 30</a></em>. The <a href="Washington_Redskins" title="wikilink">Washington Redskins</a> are the only other NFL team that currently has a marching band.</p>

On July 23, 2002, at the close of the evidence, the jury was asked to decide whether the Defendants had proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Non-Excluded Merchandise Revenues were attributable entirely to factors other than the Defendants' infringement of Bouchat's copyright. If the jury found that they were not, then it was charged to decide the percentage of the Non-Excluded Merchandise Revenues attributable to factors other than the infringement. After a full day of deliberations, the jury answered the first question in the affirmative, thereby denying Bouchat any monetary recovery.")<a href="#fnref40">↩</a></li>
