<h1>Ring learning with errors key exchange</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="cryptography" title="wikilink">cryptography</a>, a <a href="key_exchange" title="wikilink">public key exchange</a> is a <a href="cryptographic_algorithm" title="wikilink">cryptographic algorithm</a> which allows two parties to create and share a secret key which they use to encrypt messages between themselves. The <strong><a href="Ring_Learning_with_Errors" title="wikilink">Ring Learning with Errors</a> Key Exchange</strong> (<strong>RLWE-KEX</strong>) is one of a new class of public key exchange algorithms that are designed to be secure against an adversary that possesses a <a href="quantum_computer" title="wikilink">quantum computer</a>. This is important because all of the <a href="public_key_algorithm" title="wikilink">public key algorithms</a> in use today are easily broken by a quantum computer and scientists are making steady progress toward creating such a computer. The <a href="Ring_Learning_with_Errors" title="wikilink">RLWE</a>-KEX is one of a set of <a href="Post-quantum_cryptography" title="wikilink">Post Quantum cryptographic</a> algorithms being which are based on the difficulty of solving mathematical certain mathematical problems involving <a href="Lattice-based_cryptography" title="wikilink">lattices</a>. Unlike older lattice based cryptographic algorithms, the <a href="Ring_Learning_with_Errors" title="wikilink">RLWE</a>-KEX is provably reducible to a known hard problem in lattices.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Since the 1980s the security of cryptographic <a href="key_exchange" title="wikilink">key exchange</a>s and <a href="digital_signature" title="wikilink">digital signature</a>s over the internet has been primarily based on a small number of <a href="public_key" title="wikilink">public key</a> algorithms. The security of these algorithms is based on a similarly small number of computationally hard problems in classical computing. These problems are the difficulty of <a href="Integer_factorization" title="wikilink">factoring the product of two carefully chosen prime numbers</a>, the difficulty to compute <a href="discrete_logarithms" title="wikilink">discrete logarithms</a> in a carefully chosen finite field, and the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms in a carefully chosen <a href="elliptic_curve" title="wikilink">elliptic curve</a> group. These problems are very difficult to solve on a classical computer (the type of computer the world has known since the 1940's through today) but are rather easily solved by a relatively small <a href="Quantum_computing" title="wikilink">quantum computer</a> using only 5 to 10 thousand of bits of memory. As of 2015 no one has built a quantum computer with even 50-bits of memory but there is optimism in the computer industry that larger scale quantum computers will be available in the next 15 years. If a <a href="quantum_computer" title="wikilink">quantum computer</a> of sufficient size were built, all of the public key algorithms based on these three classically hard problems would become extremely insecure. This public key cryptography is used today to secure internet websites, protect computer login information, and prevent our computers from accepting malicious software.</p>

<p>Cryptography that is not susceptible to attack by a quantum computer is referred to as <a href="Post-quantum_cryptography" title="wikilink">Quantum Safe</a>, or <a href="Post-quantum_cryptography" title="wikilink">Post-Quantum cryptography</a>. One class of quantum resistant cryptographic algorithms is based on a concept called "<a href="Learning_with_errors" title="wikilink">Learning with errors</a>" introduced by Oded Regev in 2005.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> A specialized form of Learning with errors operates within the <a href="Polynomial_ring" title="wikilink">Ring of Polynomials</a> over a <a href="Finite_field" title="wikilink">Finite Field</a>. This specialized form is called <a href="Ring_Learning_with_Errors" title="wikilink">Ring Learning with Errors</a> or <a href="Ideal_lattice_cryptography" title="wikilink">RLWE</a>.</p>

<p>There are a variety of cryptographic algorithms which work using the RLWE paradigm. There are <a href="Public-key_cryptography" title="wikilink">public key encryption</a> algorithms, <a href="homomorphic_encryption" title="wikilink">homomorphic encryption</a> algorithms, and <a href="Ring_learning_with_errors_signature" title="wikilink">RLWE digital signature</a> algorithms in addition to the public key, key exchange algorithm presented in this article</p>

<p>A <a href="key_exchange_algorithm" title="wikilink">key exchange algorithm</a> is a type of public key algorithm which establishes a shared secret key between two communicants on a communications link. The classic example of a key exchange is the <a href="Diffie–Hellman_key_exchange" title="wikilink">Diffie-Hellman</a> key exchange. The exchange consists of one transmission from one end of the line and one transmission from the other end of the link. <a href="Diffie–Hellman_key_exchange" title="wikilink">Diffie-Hellman</a> and <a href="Elliptic_curve_Diffie–Hellman" title="wikilink">Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman</a> are the two most popular key exchange algorithms.</p>

<p>The RLWE Key Exchange is designed to be a "<a href="Quantum_Safe_Cryptography" title="wikilink">quantum safe</a>" replacement for the widely used <a class="uri" href="Diffie-Hellman" title="wikilink">Diffie-Hellman</a> and <a href="Elliptic_Curve_Diffie-Hellman" title="wikilink">Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman</a> key exchanges that are used to secure the establishment of secret keys over untrusted communications channels. Like Diffie-Hellman and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman, the Ring-LWE key exchange provides a cryptographic property called "<a href="forward_secrecy" title="wikilink">forward secrecy</a>"; the aim of which is to reduce the effectiveness of <a href="mass_surveillance" title="wikilink">mass surveillance</a> programs and ensure that there are no long term secret keys that can be compromised that would enable bulk decryption.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Starting with a <a href="Prime_number" title="wikilink">prime</a> integer q, the <a href="Ring_Learning_with_Errors" title="wikilink">Ring-LWE</a> key exchange works in the <a href="ring_of_polynomials" title="wikilink">ring of polynomials</a> modulo a polynomial Φ(x) with coefficients in the field of integers mod q (i.e. the ring F<sub>q</sub>[x]/Φ(x) ). Multiplication and addition of polynomials will work in the usual fashion with results of a multiplication reduced mod g(x). This article will closely follow the RLWE work of Peikert in "Lattice Cryptography for the Internet" as further explained by Singh.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> For this presentation a typical polynomial is expressed as:</p>

<p>a(x) = a<sub>0</sub> + a<sub>1</sub>x + a<sub>2</sub>x<sup>2</sup> + ... + a<sub>n-3</sub>x<sup>n-3</sup> + a<sub>n-2</sub>x<sup>n-2</sup> + a<sub>n-1</sub>x<sup>n-1</sup></p>

<p>The coefficients of this polynomial, the a<sub>i</sub>'s, are integers mod q. The polynomial Φ(x) will be Φ(x) = x<sup>n</sup> +1 where n is a power of 2 (values for n = 256, 512, or 1024 are usually referenced in the academic literature).</p>

<p>The RLWE-KEX uses polynomials which are considered "small" with respect to a measure called the "<a href="infinity_norm" title="wikilink">infinity norm</a>." The infinity norm for a polynomial is simply the value of the largest coefficient of the polynomial when the coefficients are considered as elements of the set {-(q-1)/2,..., 0, ... (q-1)/2}. The algorithm's security will depend on an ability to generate random polynomials which are small with respect to the infinity norm. This is done simply by randomly generating the coefficients for a polynomial (s<sub>n-1</sub>, ..., s<sub>0</sub>) which are guaranteed or very likely to be small. There are two common ways to do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using <a href="Uniform_distribution_(discrete)" title="wikilink">Uniform Sampling</a> - The coefficients of the small polynomial are uniformly sampled from a set of small coefficients. Let b be an integer that is much less than q. If we randomly choose coefficients from the set: { -b, -b+1, -b+2. ... -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ... , b-2, b-1, b} the polynomial will be small with respect to the bound (b). Singh suggest using b = 5.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Thus coefficients would be chosen from the set { q-5, q-4, q-3, q-2, q-1, 0 , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }.</li>
<li>Using <a href="Gaussian_distribution" title="wikilink">Discrete Gaussian</a> Sampling - For an odd value for q, the coefficients are randomly chosen by sampling from the set { -(q-1)/2 to (q-1)/2 } according to a discrete Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and distribution parameter σ. The references describe in full detail how this can be accomplished. It is more complicated than uniform sampling but it allows for a proof of security of the algorithm. An overview of Gaussian sampling is found in a presentation by Peikert.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></li>
</ol>

<p>For the rest of this article, the random small polynomials will be sampled according do a distribution which is simply be specified as <strong>D</strong>. Further q will be an odd prime such that q is congruent to 1 mod 4 and 1 mod 2n. The maximum degree of the polynomials (n) will be a power of 2. This follows the work of Singh.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Other cases for q and n are thoroughly discussed in "A Toolkit for Ring-LWE Cryptography."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> A fixed public polynomial, a(x), shared by all users of the network. It is deterministically generated from a cryptographically secure source.</p>

<p>Given a(x) as stated, we can randomly choose small polynomials s(x) and e(x) to be the "private key" in a public key exchange. The corresponding public key will be the polynomial t(x) = a(x)s(x) + e(x). The security of the key exchange that follows is based the difficulty of finding a pair of small polynomials s'(x) and e'(x) such that for a given t(x), a(x)s'(x) + e'(x) = t(x).</p>
<h2 id="the-key-exchange">The Key Exchange</h2>

<p>The key exchange will take place between two devices. There will be an initiator for the key exchange designated as (I) and a respondent designated as (R). Both I and R know, q, n, a(x), and have the ability to generate small polynomials according to the distribution <strong>D</strong>. The description which follows does not contain any explanation of why the key exchange results in the same key at both ends of a link. Rather, it succinctly specifies the steps to be taken. For a thorough understanding of why the key exchange results in the initiator and responder having the same key, the reader should look at the referenced works by Peikert and Singh.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>The key exchange begins with the initiator (I) doing the following:</p>

<p><strong>Initiator's First Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Generate two small polynomials s<sub>I</sub>(x) and e<sub>I</sub>(x) by sampling from the distribution D.</li>
<li>Compute t<sub>I</sub>(x) = a(x)·s<sub>I</sub>(x) + e<sub>I</sub>(x).</li>
<li>The initiator sends the polynomial t<sub>I</sub>(x) to the Responder.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Respondent's Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Generate two small polynomials s<sub>R</sub>(x) and e<sub>R</sub>(x) by sampling from the distribution D.</li>
<li>Compute <strong>v(x) =</strong> <strong>t<sub>I</sub>(x)·s<sub>R</sub>(x) + e<sub>R</sub>(x)</strong> <em>Note that v(x) = a(x)s<sub>I</sub>(x)s<sub>R</sub>(x) + e<sub>I</sub>(x)s<sub>R</sub>(x) + e<sub>R</sub>(x) and that e<sub>R</sub>(x) + e<sub>I</sub>(x)s<sub>R</sub>(x) will be small because e<sub>R</sub>(x) was chosen to be small and the coefficients of e<sub>I</sub>(x)s<sub>R</sub>(x) will be bounded in their growth and still relatively small.</em></li>
<li>The distribution of the coefficients of v(x) are smoothed by looping through the coefficients and randomly adjusting certain values. For j = 0 to n-1:
<ol>
<li>If v<sub>j</sub> = 0, draw a random bit (b). If b = 0 then v<sub>j</sub> = 0 otherwise v<sub>j</sub> = q-1</li>
<li>If v<sub>j</sub> = (q-1)/4, draw a random bit (b). If b = 0 then v<sub>j</sub> = (q-1)/4 otherwise v<sub>j</sub> = (q+3)/4</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Two n-long bit streams, cj, and uj, are formed from the coefficients of v(x), (v<sub>n-1</sub>, ... , v<sub>0</sub> ), via "Cross Rounding" and "Modular Rounding" respectively. For j = 0 to n-1:
<ol>
<li>Set c<sub>j</sub> to be the lowest bit of the <a href="Floor_and_ceiling_functions" title="wikilink">floor</a> of quotient (4v<sub>j</sub>)/q<a href="nearest_integer_function" title="wikilink">;</a> that is

<li>An n-long bit stream (uj) is formed by looping through the coefficients of w(x) and performing "Key Reconciliation." For j = 0 to n-1:
<ol>
<li>If c<sub>j</sub> = 0 and -q/8 ≤ w<sub>j</sub> j = 0 otherwise u<sub>j</sub> = 1</li>
<li>If c<sub>j</sub> = 1 and -3q/8 ≤ w<sub>j</sub> j = 0 otherwise u<sub>j</sub> = 1</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Form the key (k) as the concatenation of u<sub>n-1</sub>, ..., u<sub>0</sub></li>
</ol>

<p>If the key exchange worked properly, the initiator's string: u<sub>n-1</sub>, ..., u<sub>0</sub> and the respondent's string: u<sub>n-1</sub>, ..., u<sub>0</sub> will be the same.</p>

<p>Depending on the specifics of the parameters chosen n, q, σ, or b, there is an extremely small probability that this key exchange will fail to produce the same key. Parameters for the key exchange can be chosen to make the probability of failure in the key exchange very small; much less than the probability of undetectable garbles or device failures.</p>
<h2 id="parameter-choices">Parameter Choices</h2>

<p>The RWLE-KEX exchange presented above worked in the Ring of Polynomials of degree n-1 or less mod a polynomial Φ(x). The presentation assumed that n was a power of 2 and that q was a prime which was congruent to 1 (mod 4). Following the guidance given in Peikert's paper, Singh suggested two sets of parameters for the RWLE-KEX.</p>

<p>For 128 bits of security, n = 512, q = 25601, and Φ(x) = x<sup>512</sup> + 1</p>

<p>For 256 bits of security, n = 1024, q = 40961, and Φ(x) = x<sup>1024</sup> + 1</p>

<p>Because the key exchange uses random sampling and fixed bounds there is a small probability that the key exchange will fail to produce the same key for the initiator and responder. If we assume that the Gaussian parameter σ is 8/sqrt(2σ) and the uniform sampling bound (b) = 5 (see Singh),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> then the probability of key agreement failure is <u>less than</u> 2<sup>−71</sup> for the 128-bit secure parameters and <u>less than</u> 2<sup>−91</sup> for the 256-bit secure parameters.</p>
<h2 id="key-exchange-security">Key Exchange Security</h2>

<p>The security of this key exchange as well the underlying <a href="Ring_Learning_with_Errors" title="wikilink">Ring Learning With Errors</a> method has been proven to be as hard as the worst case solution to the <a href="Shortest_vector_problem" title="wikilink">Shortest Vector Problem</a> (SVP) in an <a href="Ideal_lattice_cryptography" title="wikilink">Ideal Lattice</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The best method to gauge the practical security of a given set of lattice parameters is the BKZ 2.0 lattice reduction algorithm.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> According to the BKZ 2.0 algorithm the key exchange parameters listed above will provide greater than 128 or 256 bits of security, respectively.</p>
<h2 id="other-approaches">Other approaches</h2>

<p>A variant of the approach described above but with very different reconciliation function and parameter choices is the work of Zhang, Zhang, Ding, Snook and Dagdelen in their paper, "Post Quantum Authenticated Key Exchange from Ideal Lattices."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The concept of creating what has been called a Diffie-Hellman-like Key Exchange using lattices with a reconciliation function appears to have first been presented by French researchers Aguilar, Gaborit, Lacharme, Schrek, and Zemor at PQCrypto 2010 in their talk, "Noisy Diffie-Hellman Protocols."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> This work was then extended and put on a much more rigorous foundation by Peikert in his writings.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
