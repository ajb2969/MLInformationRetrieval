<h1>Epsilon Eridani in fiction</h1>
<hr/>

<p> The <a href="planetary_system" title="wikilink">planetary systems</a> of <a href="star" title="wikilink">stars</a> other than the <a class="uri" href="Sun" title="wikilink">Sun</a> and the <a href="Solar_System" title="wikilink">Solar System</a> are a staple element in much <a href="science_fiction" title="wikilink">science fiction</a>. <a href="Epsilon_Eridani" title="wikilink">Epsilon Eridani</a> is the fifth brightest star (by <a href="apparent_magnitude" title="wikilink">apparent magnitude</a>) in the riverine southern constellation of <a href="Eridanus_(constellation)" title="wikilink">Eridanus</a>. An orange star slightly smaller and less massive than the Sun, and relatively close to the Solar System, it is frequently featured in works of science fiction.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It is classified as a type K2 star, with the corresponding suggestion that it has a stable <a href="habitable_zone" title="wikilink">habitable zone</a> and is <a href="Stellar_classification#Class_K" title="wikilink">well suited for life</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, one factor which weakens the case for habitability is its youth—as little as 200 million years old<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>—and consequent high levels of ultraviolet emission<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> (see <em><a href="#Literature" title="wikilink">Implied Spaces</a></em> by Walter Jon Williams, below).</p>
<h2 id="general-uses-of-epsilon-eridani">General uses of Epsilon Eridani</h2>

<p> Many stars may be referred to in fictional works for their <a href="metaphor" title="wikilink">metaphorical</a> or <a href="mythology" title="wikilink">mythological</a> associations, or else as bright points of light in the <a href="night_sky" title="wikilink">sky of the Earth</a>, but not as locations in space or the centers of planetary systems.</p>

<p>The constellation Eridanus flows north and south in the night sky, and Epsilon Eridani is one of its more northerly stars (see map), which allows it to be seen from most of the Earth's surface. However, because of its unprepossessing appearance in the sky, and its want of a "good" traditional name to supplement its esoteric Bayer designation, Epsilon Eridani has rarely if ever been used in a general sense, either in traditional mythologies or in the arts and literature that draw inspiration from them.</p>

<p>The star's popularity as a subject of science fiction stems not from its general cultural resonance, but from the <a href="Epsilon_Eridani" title="wikilink">astronomical data</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its proximity, ~10.5 light-years distant</li>
<li>Its similarity to the Sun, ~0.82

In the story, as told by Scholar Ron Melmwn (a Mikin anthropologist who establishes tentative inter-species rapport with his human counterparts, professor Dahlmann and his daughter Mary), culture shock abounds as men and women interact with visitors who are bent on immigration, trade—and maybe exterminating the human race.</li>

A scientific team monitors the last days of the intelligent but radically alien tribes of Epsilon Eridani's frigid second planet, <em>Mancken's World</em>, as a wandering stellar black hole finds its way through the star's planetary system. The hole makes a feast of the <a href="gas_giant" title="wikilink">gas giant</a> fifth planet but passes nowhere near Mancken's; however on its close encounter with ε Eridani itself, it will raise a storm of huge planet-scouring flares.

<li><em><a href="Frederik_Pohl#Other_novels_(not_part_of_a_series)" title="wikilink">Starburst</a></em> (1982), a novel by <a href="Frederik_Pohl" title="wikilink">Frederik Pohl</a>. A crew of superb human specimens is sent on what they believe is mankind's first voyage to a planet in another star system. Dr. Dieter von Knefhausen knows better—for there is no planet, no place to go, and no place from which to return. In a fabrication recalling the <a href="Moon_landing_conspiracy_theories" title="wikilink">supposedly fake NASA Moon landings</a> of an earlier century<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Knefhausen has planned it that way.

However the <em>Thistledown</em> never fulfilled the mission, instead getting whip-snapped into an alternate universe immediately upon the activation of <em>the Way</em>, an endless jump street her builders somehow managed to embed within her finite confines.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></li>

The "Kooks" are honest, honor-bound, and dull in personality; in both novels, the planet serves as the setting for a number of more or less conventional pre-industrial adventures.</li>
<li><em><a href="Starquake_(novel)" title="wikilink">Starquake</a></em> (1989), a novel by <a href="Robert_L._Forward" title="wikilink">Robert Forward</a>. <em><a href="Dragon's_Egg" title="wikilink">Dragon's Egg</a></em>, a neutron star, has wandered into the vicinity of the Solar System and into the ken of Earth scientists. It has some "dazzling" statistics: a surface gravity 67 billion times that of the Earth, soaring mountains as high as a few inches, ruinous starquakes, and tiny intelligent inhabitants whose life processes are accelerated over ours by a factor of almost half a million. Over a period of a day, human observers inadvertently introduce the rudiments of civilization, and within a man's lifetime the "immensely enjoyable" alien <em>cheela</em> have lived a whole history, progressing even to interstellar exploration and leaving the secrets of FTL travel stashed in a conspicuous landmark on a planet of Epsilon Eridani—as a reward for a humanity enterprising enough to get there.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></li>
<li><em><a href="Kathy_Tyers#Bibliography" title="wikilink">Shivering World</a></em> (1991), a novel by <a href="Kathy_Tyers" title="wikilink">Kathy Tyers</a>. Dr. Graysha Brady-Phillips is suffering from a genetic disease that causes early death. When she is offered a position on the newly terraformed <em>Goddard</em>, a refuge from the ecological ruin of the Earth where the average life span exceeds 150 years, she leaps at the chance; the colonists' radical—and illegal—science just might be her only hope for a cure. The world Goddard is accompanied in Epsilon Eridani orbit by the older artificial habitat <em>Copernicus</em>, ensconced in one of the planet's stable LaGrange points. But whole planets are better: "On broader worlds like this—he squinted towards the red sun his people had once called Eps Eridani—a wiser humanity might start again..."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></li>

Only three times in its 50,000-year history has this expansionist species of reptilian aliens organized such an armada, each time with the goal of subduing another civilization: the Rabotev (inhabitants of Epsilon Eridani), the Halessi, and now humanity. However, the invaders are in for a surprise, as their most recent intelligence on the Earth dates from the Middle Ages. Alternate world stories are a specialty of historian Turtledove, whose "thorough understanding of his source material gracefully infiltrates the fun and fantastication."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></li>

The Havenite Navy launches a devastating barrage of simultaneous surprise attacks on Manticore and her allies. Lester Tourville, in command of the task force attacking Zanzibar, plans a risky maneuver to knock out its orbital installations—but if any of his missiles hit the planet, there'll be hell to pay: "... violation of the Epsilon Eridani Edict’s ban on indiscriminate planetary bombardment was the one thing <em>guaranteed</em> to bring the Solarian League Navy down on any star nation like a hammer."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The prohibitions in the Edict stem from the Epsilon Eridani Incident, an early space war atrocity entailing the mass destruction of one of the League's oldest worlds.</li>

The work will be completed just as the refugee ship, carrying most of what remains of Earth's devastated population, arrives to colonize her. The ship, designed for 1000 souls, will carry 4000—at the expense of almost all her cargo. But that's ok: When the bare survival of the race is at stake, such niceties as any technology past knives, ropes, and hammers would be a sheer luxury.
