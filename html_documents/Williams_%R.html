<h1>Williams %R</h1>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Williams %R</strong>, or just <strong>%R</strong>, is a <a href="technical_analysis" title="wikilink">technical analysis</a> <a href="oscillator_(technical_analysis)" title="wikilink">oscillator</a> showing the current closing price in relation to the high and low of the past N days (for a given N). It was developed by a publisher and promoter of trading materials, <a href="Larry_R._Williams" title="wikilink">Larry Williams</a>. Its purpose is to tell whether a <a href="stock_market" title="wikilink">stock</a> or <a href="Commodities#Commodity_trade" title="wikilink">commodity</a> market is trading near the high or the low, or somewhere in between, of its recent trading range.</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\%R = { high_{Ndays} - close_{today} \over high_{Ndays} - low_{Ndays} } \times -100$$</span> <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The oscillator is on a negative scale, from −100 (lowest) up to 0 (highest), obverse of the more common 0 to 100 scale found in many Technical Analysis oscillators. A value of −100 means the close today was the lowest low of the past N days, and 0 means today's close was the highest high of the past N days. (Although sometimes the %R is adjusted by adding 100.)</p>
<h2 id="buy-sell-signalling">Buy-/Sell-Signalling</h2>
<p>Williams used a 10 trading day period and considered values below -80 as oversold and above -20 as overbought. But they were not to be traded directly, instead his rule to buy an oversold was</p>
<ul>
<li>%R reaches -100%.</li>
<li>Five trading days pass since -100% was last reached</li>
<li>%R fall below -95% or -85%.</li>
</ul>
<p>or conversely to sell an overbought condition</p>
<ul>
<li>%R reaches 0%.</li>
<li>Five trading days pass since 0% was last reached</li>
<li>%R rise above -5% or -15%.</li>
</ul>
<p>The timeframe can be changed for either more sensitive or smoother results. The more sensitive you make it, though, the more false signals you will get.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>Due to the equivalence</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$${ (close_{today} - low_{Ndays}) - (close_{today} - high_{Ndays}) = high_{Ndays} - low_{Ndays} }$$</span></p>
<p>the %R indicator is arithmetically exactly equivalent to the %K <a href="stochastic_oscillator" title="wikilink">stochastic oscillator</a>, mirrored at the 0%-line, when using the same time interval.</p>
