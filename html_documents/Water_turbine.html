<h1>Water turbine</h1>
<hr/>

<p>''' </p>

<p>A <strong>water turbine</strong> is a rotary <a class="uri" href="engine" title="wikilink">engine</a> that converts <a href="kinetic_energy" title="wikilink">kinetic</a> and <a href="potential_energy" title="wikilink">potential energy</a> of water into <a href="mechanical_work" title="wikilink">mechanical work</a>.</p>

<p>Water <a href="turbine" title="wikilink">turbines</a> were developed in the 19th century and were widely used for industrial power prior to <a href="electrical_grid" title="wikilink">electrical grids</a>. Now they are mostly used for <a href="electric_power" title="wikilink">electric power</a> generation. Water turbines are mostly found in <a href="dam" title="wikilink">dams</a> to generate electric power from water <a href="kinetic_energy" title="wikilink">kinetic energy</a>.</p>

<p><a href="Water_wheel" title="wikilink">Water wheels</a> have been used for hundreds of years for industrial power. Their main shortcoming is size, which limits the flow rate and <a href="head_(hydraulic)" title="wikilink">head</a> that can be harnessed. The migration from water wheels to modern turbines took about one hundred years. Development occurred during the <a href="Industrial_revolution" title="wikilink">Industrial revolution</a>, using scientific principles and methods. They also made extensive use of new materials and manufacturing methods developed at the time.</p>
<h3 id="swirl">Swirl</h3>

<p>The word <a class="uri" href="turbine" title="wikilink">turbine</a> was introduced by the French engineer <a href="Claude_Burdin" title="wikilink">Claude Burdin</a> in the early 19th century and is derived from the Latin word for "whirling" or a "vortex". The main difference between early water turbines and water wheels is a swirl component of the water which passes energy to a spinning rotor. This additional component of motion allowed the turbine to be smaller than a water wheel of the same power. They could process more water by spinning faster and could harness much greater heads. (Later, impulse turbines were developed which didn't use swirl).</p>
<h3 id="time-line">Time line</h3>

<p> </p>

<p>The earliest known water turbines date to the <a href="Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Roman Empire</a>. <a href="List_of_Roman_watermills" title="wikilink">Two helix-turbine mill sites</a> of almost identical design were found at <a class="uri" href="Chemtou" title="wikilink">Chemtou</a> and <a class="uri" href="Testour" title="wikilink">Testour</a>, modern-day <a class="uri" href="Tunisia" title="wikilink">Tunisia</a>, dating to the late 3rd or early 4th century AD. The horizontal water wheel with angled blades was installed at the bottom of a water-filled, circular shaft. The water from the mill-race entered the pit tangentially, creating a swirling water column which made the fully submerged wheel act like a true turbine.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Fausto_Veranzio" title="wikilink">Fausto Veranzio</a> in his book Machinae Novae (1595) described a vertical axis mill with a rotor similar to that of a <a href="Francis_turbine" title="wikilink">Francis turbine</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Johann_Andreas_Segner" title="wikilink">Johann Segner</a> developed a reactive water turbine (<a href="Segner_wheel" title="wikilink">Segner wheel</a>) in the mid-18th century in <a href="Kingdom_of_Hungary" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Hungary</a>. It had a horizontal axis and was a precursor to modern water turbines. It is a very simple machine that is still produced today for use in small hydro sites. Segner worked with <a class="uri" href="Euler" title="wikilink">Euler</a> on some of the early mathematical theories of turbine design. In the 18th century, a Dr. Barker invented a similar reaction hydraulic turbine that became popular as a lecture-hall demonstration. The only known surviving example of this type of engine used in power production, dating from 1851, is found at <a href="Hacienda_Buena_Vista" title="wikilink">Hacienda Buena Vista</a> in <a href="Ponce,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Ponce, Puerto Rico</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1820, <a href="Jean-Victor_Poncelet" title="wikilink">Jean-Victor Poncelet</a> developed an inward-flow turbine.</p>

<p>In 1826, <a href="Benoit_Fourneyron" title="wikilink">Benoit Fourneyron</a> developed an outward-flow turbine. This was an efficient machine (~80%) that sent water through a runner with blades curved in one dimension. The stationary outlet also had curved guides.</p>

<p>In 1844, <a href="Uriah_A._Boyden" title="wikilink">Uriah A. Boyden</a> developed an outward flow turbine that improved on the performance of the Fourneyron turbine. Its runner shape was similar to that of a <a href="Francis_turbine" title="wikilink">Francis turbine</a>.</p>

<p>In 1849, <a href="James_B._Francis" title="wikilink">James B. Francis</a> improved the inward flow reaction turbine to over 90% efficiency. He also conducted sophisticated tests and developed engineering methods for water turbine design. The <a href="Francis_turbine" title="wikilink">Francis turbine</a>, named for him, is the first modern water turbine. It is still the most widely used water turbine in the world today. The Francis turbine is also called a radial flow turbine, since water flows from the outer circumference towards the centre of runner.</p>

<p>Inward flow water turbines have a better mechanical arrangement and all modern reaction water turbines are of this design. As the water swirls inward, it accelerates, and transfers energy to the runner. Water pressure decreases to atmospheric, or in some cases subatmospheric, as the water passes through the turbine blades and loses energy.</p>

<p>Around 1890, the modern <a href="fluid_bearing" title="wikilink">fluid bearing</a> was invented, now universally used to support heavy water turbine spindles. As of 2002, fluid bearings appear to have a <a href="mean_time_between_failures" title="wikilink">mean time between failures</a> of more than 1300 years.</p>

<p>Around 1913, <a href="Viktor_Kaplan" title="wikilink">Viktor Kaplan</a> created the <a href="Kaplan_turbine" title="wikilink">Kaplan turbine</a>, a propeller-type machine. It was an evolution of the Francis turbine but revolutionized the ability to develop low-head hydro sites.</p>
<h3 id="new-concept">New concept</h3>

<p> </p>

<p>All common water machines until the late 19th century (including water wheels) were basically reaction machines; water <em>pressure</em> head acted on the machine and produced work. A reaction turbine needs to fully contain the water during energy transfer.</p>

<p>In 1866, California millwright Samuel Knight invented a machine that took the impulse system to a new level.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Inspired by the high pressure jet systems used in hydraulic mining in the gold fields, Knight developed a bucketed wheel which captured the energy of a free jet, which had converted a high head (hundreds of vertical feet in a pipe or <a class="uri" href="penstock" title="wikilink">penstock</a>) of water to kinetic energy. This is called an impulse or tangential turbine. The water's velocity, roughly twice the velocity of the bucket periphery, does a u-turn in the bucket and drops out of the runner at low velocity.</p>

<p>In 1879, <a href="Lester_Allan_Pelton" title="wikilink">Lester Pelton</a>, experimenting with a Knight Wheel, developed a <a href="Pelton_wheel" title="wikilink">Pelton wheel</a> (double bucket design), which exhausted the water to the side, eliminating some energy loss of the Knight wheel which exhausted some water back against the center of the wheel. In about 1895, William Doble improved on Pelton's half-cylindrical bucket form with an elliptical bucket that included a cut in it to allow the jet a cleaner bucket entry. This is the modern form of the Pelton turbine which today achieves up to 92% efficiency. Pelton had been quite an effective promoter of his design and although Doble took over the Pelton company he did not change the name to Doble because it had brand name recognition.</p>

<p><a href="Turgo_turbine" title="wikilink">Turgo</a> and <a href="cross-flow_turbine" title="wikilink">cross-flow turbines</a> were later impulse designs.</p>
<h2 id="theory-of-operation">Theory of operation</h2>

<p>Flowing water is directed on to the blades of a turbine runner, creating a force on the blades. Since the runner is spinning, the force acts through a distance (force acting through a distance is the definition of <a href="Mechanical_work" title="wikilink">work</a>). In this way, energy is transferred from the water flow to the turbine</p>

<p>Water turbines are divided into two groups; <a href="reaction_(physics)" title="wikilink">reaction</a> turbines and <a href="Impulse_(physics)" title="wikilink">impulse</a> turbines.</p>

<p>The precise shape of water turbine blades is a function of the supply pressure of water, and the type of impeller selected.</p>
<h3 id="reaction-turbines">Reaction turbines</h3>

<p>Reaction turbines are acted on by water, which changes pressure as it moves through the turbine and gives up its energy. They must be encased to contain the water pressure (or suction), or they must be fully submerged in the water flow.</p>

<p><a href="Newton's_laws_of_motion#Newton's_third_law" title="wikilink">Newton's third law</a> describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines.</p>

<p>Most water turbines in use are reaction turbines and are used in low (300m/1000 ft) head applications.</p>

<p>Turbine selection is based on the available water head, and less so on the available flow rate. In general, impulse turbines are used for high head sites, and reaction turbines are used for <a href="Low_head_hydro_power" title="wikilink">low head</a> sites. Kaplan turbines with adjustable blade pitch are well-adapted to wide ranges of flow or head conditions, since their peak efficiency can be achieved over a wide range of flow conditions.</p>

<p>Small turbines (mostly under 10 MW) may have horizontal shafts, and even fairly large bulb-type turbines up to 100 MW or so may be horizontal. Very large Francis and Kaplan machines usually have vertical shafts because this makes best use of the available head, and makes installation of a generator more economical. Pelton wheels may be either vertical or horizontal shaft machines because the size of the machine is so much less than the available head. Some impulse turbines use multiple jets per runner to balance shaft thrust. This also allows for the use of a smaller turbine runner, which can decrease costs and mechanical losses.</p>

 of a turbine characterizes the turbine's shape in a way that is not related to its size. This allows a new turbine design to be scaled from an existing design of known performance. The specific speed is also the main criteria for matching a specific hydro site with the correct turbine type. The specific speed is the speed with which the turbine turns for a particular discharge Q, with unit head and thereby is able to produce unit power.</p>
<h3 id="affinity-laws">Affinity laws</h3>

<p><a href="Affinity_laws" title="wikilink">Affinity laws</a> allow the output of a turbine to be predicted based on model tests. A miniature replica of a proposed design, about one foot (0.3 m) in diameter, can be tested and the laboratory measurements applied to the final application with high confidence. Affinity laws are derived by requiring <a href="similitude_(model)" title="wikilink">similitude</a> between the test model and the application.</p>

<p>Flow through the turbine is controlled either by a large valve or by wicket gates arranged around the outside of the turbine runner. Differential head and flow can be plotted for a number of different values of gate opening, producing a hill diagram used to show the efficiency of the turbine at varying conditions.</p>
<h3 id="runaway-speed">Runaway speed</h3>

<p>The <strong>runaway speed</strong> of a water turbine is its speed at full flow, and no shaft load. The turbine will be designed to survive the mechanical forces of this speed. The manufacturer will supply the runaway speed rating.</p>

</figure>

<p>Different designs of <a href="Governor_(device)" title="wikilink">governors</a> have been used since the mid-19th century to control the speeds of the water turbines. A variety of <a href="centrifugal_governor" title="wikilink">flyball</a> systems, or first-generation governors, were used during the first 100 years of water turbine speed controls. In early flyball systems, the flyball component countered by a spring acted directly to the valve of the turbine or the <a href="wicket_gate" title="wikilink">wicket gate</a> to control the amount of water that enters the turbines. Newer systems with mechanical governors started around 1880. An early mechanical governors is a <a class="uri" href="servomechanism" title="wikilink">servomechanism</a> that comprises a series of gears that use the turbine's speed to drive the flyball and turbine's power to drive the control mechanism. The mechanical governors were continued to be enhanced in power amplification through the use of gears and the dynamic behavior. By 1930, the mechanical governors had many parameters that could be set on the feedback system for precise controls. In the later part of the twentieth century, electronic governors and digital systems started to replace the mechanical governors. In the electronic governors, also known as second-generation governors, the flyball was replaced by rotational speed <a class="uri" href="sensor" title="wikilink">sensor</a> but the controls were still done through <a href="Analog_device" title="wikilink">analog</a> systems. In the modern systems, also known as third-generation governors, the controls are performed digitally by <a href="algorithm" title="wikilink">algorithms</a> that are programmed to the computer of the governor.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>Turbines are designed to run for decades with very little maintenance of the main elements; overhaul intervals are on the order of several years. Maintenance of the runners and parts exposed to water include removal, inspection, and repair of worn parts.</p>

<h2 id="environmental-impact">Environmental impact</h2>

<p>Water turbines are generally considered a clean power producer, as the turbine causes essentially no change to the water. They use a renewable energy source and are designed to operate for decades. They produce significant amounts of the world's electrical supply.</p>

<p>Historically there have also been negative consequences, mostly associated with the dams normally required for power production. Dams alter the natural ecology of rivers, potentially killing fish, stopping <a href="Fish_migration" title="wikilink">migrations</a>, and disrupting peoples' livelihoods. For example, <a href="American_Indians_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">American Indian</a> tribes in the <a href="Pacific_Northwest" title="wikilink">Pacific Northwest</a> had livelihoods built around <a class="uri" href="salmon" title="wikilink">salmon</a> <a class="uri" href="fishing" title="wikilink">fishing</a>, but aggressive dam-building destroyed their way of life. Dams also cause less obvious, but potentially serious consequences, including increased evaporation of water (especially in arid regions), buildup of <a class="uri" href="silt" title="wikilink">silt</a> behind the dam, and changes to water temperature and flow patterns. In the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, it is now illegal to block the migration of fish, for example the <a href="white_sturgeon" title="wikilink">white sturgeon</a> in <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a>, so <a href="fish_ladder" title="wikilink">fish ladders</a> must be provided by dam builders.</p>
