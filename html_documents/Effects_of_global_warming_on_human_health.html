<h1>Effects of global warming on human health</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <a href="effects_of_global_warming" title="wikilink">effects of global warming</a> include effects on human health. This article describes some of those effects on individuals and populations. The observed and projected increased frequency and severity of climate related impacts will further exacerbate the effects on human health.</p>
<h2 id="impact-on-infectious-diseases">Impact on infectious diseases</h2>

<p>Warming oceans and a changing climate are resulting in extreme weather patterns which have brought about an increase of <a href="infectious_diseases" title="wikilink">infectious diseases</a>—both new and re-emerging.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> These extreme weather patterns are creating extended <a href="rainy_seasons" title="wikilink">rainy seasons</a> in some areas,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and extended periods of <a class="uri" href="drought" title="wikilink">drought</a> in others,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> as well as introducing new climates to different regions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> These extended seasons are creating climates that are able to sustain <a href="vector_(epidemiology)" title="wikilink">vectors</a> for longer periods of time, allowing them to multiply rapidly, and also creating climates that are allowing the introduction and survival of new vectors.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="impact-of-extreme-weather">Impact of extreme weather</h3>

<p>“The rise of extreme weather is itself a symptom of an unstable climate. Moreover, the variance around the long-term warming trend has begun to influence <a href="biological_systems" title="wikilink">biological systems</a>, Indeed, two main effects of climate change—warming and greater weather variability-mean that millions of people worldwide face a higher risk of infectious disease”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> <a href="El_Nino" title="wikilink">El Nino</a> is an extreme weather pattern that is often responsible for increased precipitation, resulting in increased <a class="uri" href="flooding" title="wikilink">flooding</a>, creating a more promising breeding ground for a plethora of vectors that both carry and cause infectious diseases.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>Another result of the warming oceans are stronger <a class="uri" href="hurricanes" title="wikilink">hurricanes</a>, which will wreck more havoc on land, and in the oceans,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and create more opportunities for vectors to breed and infectious diseases to flourish.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> <a href="Extreme_weather" title="wikilink">Extreme weather</a> also means stronger winds. These winds can carry vectors tens of thousands of kilometers, resulting in an introduction of new infectious agents to regions that have never seen them before, making the humans in these regions even more susceptible.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>Mosquito-borne diseases are probably the greatest threat to humans as they include <a class="uri" href="malaria" title="wikilink">malaria</a>, <a href="Lymphatic_filariasis" title="wikilink">elephantiasis</a>, <a href="Rift_Valley_fever" title="wikilink">Rift Valley fever</a>, <a href="yellow_fever" title="wikilink">yellow fever</a>, and <a href="dengue_fever" title="wikilink">dengue fever</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Studies are showing higher prevalence of these diseases in areas that have experienced extreme flooding and drought.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Flooding creates more standing water for mosquitoes to breed; as well, shown that these vectors are able to feed more and grow faster in warmer climates.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> As the climate warms over the oceans and coastal regions, warmer temperatures are also creeping up to higher elevations allowing mosquitoes to survive in areas they had never been able to before.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> As the climate continues to warm there is a risk that malaria will make a return to the developed world.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p><a class="uri" href="Ticks" title="wikilink">Ticks</a> are also thriving in the warmer temperatures allowing them to feed and grow at a faster rate.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The <a href="black_legged_tick" title="wikilink">black legged tick</a>, a carrier of <a href="Lyme_disease" title="wikilink">Lyme disease</a>, when not feeding, spends its time burrowed in soil absorbing moisture.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Ticks die when the climate either becomes too cold or when the climate becomes too dry, causing the ticks to dry out.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The natural environmental controls that used to keep the tick populations in check are disappearing, and warmer and wetter climates are allowing the ticks to breed and grow at an alarming rate, resulting in an increase in Lyme disease, both in existing areas and in areas where it has not been seen before.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="impact-of-warmer-oceans">Impact of warmer oceans</h3>

<p>The warming oceans are becoming a breeding ground for toxic algae blooms (also known as <a href="red_tides" title="wikilink">red tides</a>) and <a class="uri" href="cholera" title="wikilink">cholera</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> As the nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the oceans increase, the cholera bacteria that lives within <a class="uri" href="zooplankton" title="wikilink">zooplankton</a> emerge from their dormant state.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The changing winds and changing ocean currents push the zooplankton toward the coastline, carrying the cholera bacteria, which then contaminate drinking water, causing <a href="cholera_outbreaks" title="wikilink">cholera outbreaks</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> As flooding increases there is also in increase in cholera epidemics as the flood waters that are carrying the bacteria are infiltrating the drinking water supply.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> El Nino has also been linked with cholera outbreaks because this weather pattern warms the shoreline waters, causing the cholera bacteria to multiply rapidly.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>Toxic algae blooms (red tides) are the result of a changing and warming climate.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> El Nino events precipitation resulting in flooding, which causes the coastal seawater to be infiltrated with runoff from the flooding land resulting in increased nitrogen and phosphorus which feed the algae and spur their growth.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> These toxic blooms in turn infect <a class="uri" href="shellfish" title="wikilink">shellfish</a>, which threatens the health of the millions of people who depend on shellfish for protein.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Paralytic shellfish poisoning is the most common result of red tides, as was seen in the 1987 outbreak in Prince Edward Island.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> <a class="uri" href="Ciguatera" title="wikilink">Ciguatera</a> fish poisoning is also a result of red tides.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Humans that ingest these infected reef dwelling fish become ill.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Further, red tides are so powerful that they also cause <a href="respiratory_illness" title="wikilink">respiratory illness</a> simply by breathing the air near them.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="malaria">Malaria</h3>

<p><a class="uri" href="Malaria" title="wikilink">Malaria</a> is a mosquito-borne parasitic disease that infects humans and other animals caused by microorganisms in the <a class="uri" href="Plasmodium" title="wikilink">Plasmodium</a> family. It begins with a bite from an infected female mosquito, which introduces the parasite through its saliva and into the infected host’s circulatory system. It then travels through the bloodstream into the liver where it can mature and reproduce.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The disease causes symptoms that typically include fever, headache, shaking chills, anemia, and in severe cases can progress to coma or death.</p>

<p>Climate is an influential driving force of vector-borne diseases such as malaria. Malaria is especially susceptible to the effects of climate change because mosquitoes lack the mechanisms to regulate their internal temperature. This implies that there is a limited range of climatic conditions within which the pathogen (malaria) and vector (a mosquito) can survive, reproduce and infect hosts.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, have distinctive characteristics that determine <a class="uri" href="pathogenicity" title="wikilink">pathogenicity</a>. These include: the survival and reproduction rate of the vector, the level of vector activity (i.e. the biting or feeding rate), and the development and reproduction rate of the pathogen within the vector or host.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Changes in climate factors substantially affect reproduction, development, distribution and seasonal transmissions of malaria.</p>

<p>Mosquitoes have a small window for preferential conditions for breeding and maturation. The ultimate breeding and maturing temperature for mosquitoes range from sixteen to eighteen degrees Celsius.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> If the temperature is decreased by two degrees, most of the insects will succumb to death. This is why malaria is unsustainable in places with cool winters. If a climate with an average of approximately 16 degrees Celsius experiences an increase of about two degrees, the mature bugs and the larvae flourish.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Female mosquitoes will need more food (human/animal blood) to sustain life and to stimulate production of eggs. This increases the chance of spread of malaria due to more human contact and a higher number of the blood sucking insects surviving and living longer. Mosquitoes are also highly sensitive to changes in precipitation and humidity. Increased precipitation can increase mosquito population indirectly by expanding larval habitat and food supply.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> These prime temperatures are creating large breeding grounds for the insects and places for the larvae to mature. Increased temperature is causing snow to melt and stagnant pools of water to become more common.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Bugs that are already carrying the disease are more likely to multiply and infect other mosquitoes causing a dangerous spread of the deadly disease.</p>

<p>Climate change has a direct impact on people’s health in places where Malaria is not prevalent. In communities of higher altitudes in <a class="uri" href="Africa" title="wikilink">Africa</a> and <a href="South_America" title="wikilink">South America</a>, people are at higher risk for developing malaria in recent years because of an increase temperature. A fluctuation of two or three degrees is creating exceptional breeding grounds for mosquitoes, for larvae to grow and mature mosquitoes carrying the virus to infect people that have never been exposed before.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> This is a severe problem because people in these communities have never been exposed to this disease causing an increased risk for complications from malaria such as cerebral malaria (a type of malaria that causes mental disability, paralysis and has a high mortality rate) and death by the disease.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Residents of these communities are being hit hard by malaria because they are unfamiliar with it; they do not know the signs and symptoms and have little to no immunity.</p>

<p>The population at risk of malaria in the absence of climate change is projected to double between 1990 and 2080 to 8820 million, however; unmitigated climate change would, by the 2080s, further increase the population at risk of malaria by another 257 to 323 million.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Therefore, reducing the effects of climate change in the present would reduce the total by about 3.5%, saving tens of thousands of lives worldwide.</p>

<p>If there is a slight discrepancy in the normal temperature, the perfect conditions for the insects to multiply are created. People that have never been infected before are unknowingly at risk for this deadly disease and do not have the immunity to combat it.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> An increase in temperature has the potential to cause a widespread <a class="uri" href="epidemic" title="wikilink">epidemic</a> of the disease that has the capacity to wipe out entire populations of people. It is important to track the prevalence, species and number of insects carrying the disease as well as the amount of humans infected in countries and places that have never seen malaria before. It is simple for the slightest of fluctuation in temperature to cause a catastrophic epidemic that has the possibility to end the lives of many innocent and unsuspecting people.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="dengue-fever">Dengue fever</h3>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>

<p><a href="Dengue_fever" title="wikilink">Dengue fever</a> is an infectious disease caused by <a href="dengue_virus" title="wikilink">dengue viruses</a> known to be in the tropical regions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> It is transmitted by mosquito <a class="uri" href="Aedes" title="wikilink">Aedes</a>, or A. aegypti.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>

<p>The cases of Dengue fever have increased dramatically since the 1970s and it continues to become more prevalent.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> The greater incidence of this disease is believed to be due to a combination of urbanization, population growth, increased international travel, and global warming.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> The same trends also led to the spread of different serotypes of the disease to new areas, and to the emergence of <a href="dengue_hemorrhagic_fever" title="wikilink">dengue hemorrhagic fever</a>. There are four different types of viruses in dengue fever. If someone is infected with one type of dengue virus, he or she will have permanent immunity to that type of dengue virus, but will have short term immunity to the other type of dengue fever.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Some of the symptoms of dengue fever are fever, headache, muscle and joint pains and skin rash.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> There is no vaccine for Dengue fever right now and there is no true treatment to get rid of it, but there are treatments to assist with some of the symptoms of dengue, such as the use of oral or intravenous fluids for rehydration.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="climate-change-impacts">Climate change impacts</h4>

<p><a href="Dengue_fever" title="wikilink">Dengue fever</a> used to be considered a <a href="tropical_disease" title="wikilink">tropical disease</a>, but <a href="climate_change" title="wikilink">climate change</a> is causing dengue fever to spread. Dengue fever is transmitted by certain types of <a class="uri" href="mosquitos" title="wikilink">mosquitos</a>, which have been spreading further and further north. This is because some of the climate changes that are occurring are increased heat, <a href="precipitation_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">precipitation</a> and <a class="uri" href="humidity" title="wikilink">humidity</a> which create prime breeding grounds for mosquitos.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The hotter and wetter a climate is the faster the mosquitos can mature and the faster the disease can develop. Another influence is the changing <a href="El_Nino" title="wikilink">El Nino</a> effects that are affecting the climate to change in different areas of the world, causing dengue fever to be able to spread.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="what-can-be-done">What can be done?</h4>

<p>There are many things that can be done, both on a governmental level and on an individual basis. 1.) Have a better system of detecting when dengue outbreaks may happen. This can be done by monitoring environments, such as temperatures, rainfall and humidity that would be attractive for these types of mosquitos to flourish. 2.) Educating the public: Letting the public know when a dengue outbreak is occurring and what they can do to protect themselves. For example, people should create a living environment that is not attractive to mosquitos (no sitting water), dress in appropriate clothing (light colours, long sleeves)and wear insect repellant.</p>
<h3 id="hivaids">HIV/AIDS</h3>

<p>HIV AIDS and Climate Change are both long wave issues that cause fear and uncertainty in the population. One of the main reasons why <a href="climate_change" title="wikilink">climate change</a> appears to have such an impact on <a class="uri" href="HIV/AIDS" title="wikilink">HIV/AIDS</a> seems to be related to food shortage. “In the fight against hunger we could now be facing a perfect storm of challenges, including climate change and increasingly severe droughts and floods, soaring food prices and the tightest supplies in recent history, declining levels of food aid, and HIV/AIDS, which also aggravates food insecurity” says Sheeran.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The lack of food security, due to climate change, in South Africa has been affected by HIV/AIDS. In <a href="Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="wikilink">Sub-Saharan Africa</a> over 70% of the population are farmers and human capital has decreased due to HIV/AIDS.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> “This reduction in the household labour capabilities severely decreases agricultural output. The source of nourishment and income for the bulk of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population, agricultural output, is further hurt by a loss in the transfer of intergenerational knowledge, as the productive adult population with experience in agricultural labour is the most severely affected by AIDS”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> This has been made worse as 90% of the people infected with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa are adults. This not only greatly reduces human capital, but it leaves many children to tend to themselves. Malnutrition, brought about by food security in Sub-Saharan Africa, exacerbates the effects of HIV/AIDS.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> A study done in <a class="uri" href="Ethiopia" title="wikilink">Ethiopia</a> showed that chronic malnutrition was a predictor of first line antiretroviral therapy failure.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> This has the potential to create more HIV deaths each year, as immune capabilities are further weakened by <a class="uri" href="Malnutrition" title="wikilink">Malnutrition</a>. Another important factor about food insecurity is that it could increase the spread of HIV AIDS from the use of <a href="Transactional_sex" title="wikilink">Transactional sex</a>. Women who are desperate and suffer malnutrition are more likely to sell their bodies in order to support themselves. Also food insecurity and poverty may prevent people from seeking a diagnosis or prevent them from having the ability to afford treatment.</p>

<p>Secondly the spread of <a class="uri" href="Malaria" title="wikilink">Malaria</a> due to climate change will also be degrading to the burden of disease of HIV/AIDS.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn74" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> As people become infected by HIV/AIDS and are then exposed to Malaria, it will create an even more substantial loss of life because AIDS victims will be less likely to be able to fight the Malaria infection. Climate change may also increase the spread of HIV/AIDS. As climate change disasters sweep the globe, more people will become displaced, and be forced to live in close quarters to one another. There is evidence to suggest that this could “aggravate gender inequalities"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn75" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> that have the potential to raise the possibility of transmission of the disease. Migrants often have poor living conditions, are separated from their spouses and families, perform demanding and dangerous jobs and have limited access to health care.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn76" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> This can all lead to an increased risk of contracting HIV/AIDS.</p>

<p>Lastly climate Change will reduce the funds available to mitigate HIV/AIDS. As more money is spent on repairing infrastructure due the increasing nature of extreme weather, less money will be available for programs to prevent HIV/AIDS and to look after those that are already infected.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn77" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> This is especially true in underdeveloped countries where they are least able to cope. The governments in these countries are less able to provide for their populations, and will even more under strain from the climate change related costs. This raises the possibility of bankrupt countries that may leed to the <a href="Failed_state" title="wikilink">Failed state</a> phenomenon. The twin effects of HIV/AIDS and Climate Change therefore will be degrading to human health.</p>
<h3 id="mental-health">Mental health</h3>

<p>While the physical health impacts of <a href="climate_change" title="wikilink">climate change</a> are well known, the impact on mental health has only begun to be recognized in the last decade.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn78" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> According to 2011 in <em><a href="American_Psychologist" title="wikilink">American Psychologist</a></em> Clayton &amp; Doherty, concluded that global climate change is bound to have substantial negative impacts on mental health and well-being, effects which will primarily be felt by vulnerable <a class="uri" href="populations" title="wikilink">populations</a> and those with pre-existing serious <a href="mental_illness" title="wikilink">mental illness</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn79" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>

<p>They identified three classes of psychological impacts from global climate change:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn80" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Direct - "Acute or traumatic effects of extreme weather events and a changed environment"</li>
<li>Indirect - "Threats to emotional well-being based on observation of impacts and concern or uncertainty about future risks"</li>
<li>Psychosocial - "Chronic social and community effects of heat, drought, migrations, and climate-related conﬂicts, and postdisaster adjustment"</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to appreciate the impacts on psychological well-being an understanding and recognition of the multiple meanings and cultural narratives associated with climate change and the interrelatedness of climate change and other global phenomena, like increased population, is required.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn81" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> The psychological impacts of climate change can be divided into three classes; direct, indirect, and psychosocial. Direct impacts refer to the immediate or localized consequences of an environmental change or <a class="uri" href="disaster" title="wikilink">disaster</a>, such as stress or injury. Indirect impacts are more gradual and cumulative and are experienced through the media and social interaction and communication. Psychosocial impacts are large-scale community and social effects, like conflicts related to <a href="Human_migration" title="wikilink">migration</a> and subsequent shortages or adjustment after a disaster. Climate change does not impact everyone equally; those of lower <a class="uri" href="economic" title="wikilink">economic</a> and social status are at greater risk and experience more devastating impacts.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn82" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="impact-on-natural-resources">Impact on natural resources</h2>
<h3 id="drinking-water">Drinking water</h3>

<p>In rural Africa and the Middle East, when droughts dry up the regular water supply, rural and impoverished families are forced to resort to drinking the dirty, sediment-and-parasite-laden water that sits in puddles and small pools on the surface of the earth. Many are aware of the presence of contamination, but will drink from these sources nonetheless in order to avoid dying of dehydration. It has been estimated that up to 80% of human illness in the world can be attributed to contaminated water.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn144" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>

<p>When there is an adequate amount of drinking water, humans drink from different sources than their livestock. However, when drought occurs and drinking water slowly disappears, catchment areas such as streams and depressions in the ground where water gathers are often shared between people and the livestock they depend on for financial and nutritional support, and this is when humans can fall seriously ill. Although some diseases that are transferred to humans can be prevented by boiling the water, many people, living on just a litre or two of water per day, refuse to boil, as it loses a certain percentage of the water to steam.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn145" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>

<p>The sharing of water between livestock and humans is one of the most common factors in the transmission of non-tuberulosis mycobacteria (NTM). NTM is carried in cattle and pig feces, and if this contaminates the drinking water supply, it can result in pulmonary disease, disseminated disease or localized lesions in humans with both compromised and competent immune systems.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn146" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> During drought, water supplies are even more susceptible to harmful algal blooms and microorganisms.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn147" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> Algal blooms increase water turbidity, suffocating aquatic plants, and can deplete oxygen, killing fish. Some kinds of blue-green algae create neurotoxins, hepatoxins, cytotoxins or endotoxins that can cause serious and sometimes fatal neurological, liver and digestive diseases in humans. Cyanobacteria grow best in warmer temperatures (especially above 25 degrees Celsius), and so areas of the world that are experiencing general warming as a result of climate change are also experiencing harmful algal blooms more frequently and for longer periods of time. During times of intense precipitation (such as during the “wet season” in much of the tropical and sub-tropical world, including Australia and Panama, nutrients that cyanobacteria depend on are carried from groundwater and the earth’s surface into bodies of water. As drought begins and these bodies gradually dry up, the nutrients are concentrated, providing the perfect opportunity for algal blooms.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn148" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn149" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn150" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="fresh-water">Fresh water</h3>

<p>As the climate warms, it changes the nature of global rainfall, evaporation, snow, stream flow and other factors that affect water supply and quality. <a class="uri" href="Freshwater" title="wikilink">Freshwater</a> resources are highly sensitive to variations in weather and climate. Climate change is projected to affect water availability. In areas where the amount of water in rivers and streams depends on snow melting, warmer temperatures increase the fraction of precipitation falling as rain rather than as snow, causing the annual spring peak in water runoff to occur earlier in the year. This can lead to an increased likelihood of winter <a href="flood" title="wikilink">flooding</a> and reduced late summer river flows. Rising sea levels cause saltwater to enter into fresh <a href="underground_water" title="wikilink">underground water</a> and freshwater streams. This reduces the amount of freshwater available for drinking and farming. Warmer water temperatures also affect water quality and accelerate <a href="water_pollution" title="wikilink">water pollution</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn151" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="food-depletion">Food depletion</h3>
<h2 id="impact-on-livestock">Impact on livestock</h2>

<p>Climate change is beginning to lead the global population into a food shortage, greatly affecting our <a class="uri" href="livestock" title="wikilink">livestock</a> supply. Although the change in our climate is causing us to lose food, these sources are also contributing to climate change, essentially, creating a <a href="feedback_loop" title="wikilink">feedback loop</a>. <a href="Greenhouse_gases" title="wikilink">Greenhouse gases</a>, specifically from livestock, are one of the leading sources furthering global warming; these emissions, which drastically effect climatic change, are also beginning to harm our livestock in ways we could never imagine.</p>
<h3 id="greenhouse-gas-effects">Greenhouse gas effects</h3>

<p>Our agricultural food system is responsible for a significant amount of the greenhouse-gas emissions that are produced.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn152" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn153" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a></p>

<p>According to the <a class="uri" href="IPCC" title="wikilink">IPCC</a>, it makes up between, at least, 10-12% of the emissions, and when there are changes in land due to the agriculture, it can even rise as high as 17%. More specifically, emissions from farms, such as <a href="nitrous_oxide" title="wikilink">nitrous oxide</a>, <a class="uri" href="methane" title="wikilink">methane</a> and <a href="carbon_dioxide" title="wikilink">carbon dioxide</a>, are the main culprits, and can be held accountable for up to half of the greenhouse-gases produced by the overall food industry, or 80% of all emissions just within agriculture.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn154" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a></p>

<p>The types of farm animals, as well as the food they supply can be put into two categories: <a class="uri" href="monogastric" title="wikilink">monogastric</a> and <a class="uri" href="ruminant" title="wikilink">ruminant</a>. Typically, beef and dairy, in other words, ruminant products, rank high in greenhouse-gas emissions; monogastric, or pigs and poultry-related foods, are low. The consumption of the monogastric types, therefore, yield less emissions. This is due to the fact that these types of animals have a higher feed-conversion efficiency, and also do not produce any methane.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn155" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a></p>

<p>As lower-income countries begin, and continue, to develop, the necessity for a consistent meat supply will increase.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn156" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn157" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> This means the cattle population will be required to grow in order to keep up with the demand, producing the highest possible rate of greenhouse-gas emissions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn158" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a></p>

<p>There are some strategies that can be used to help soften the effects, and the further production of greenhouse-gas emissions. Although there are many, some of them include: a higher efficiency in livestock farming, which includes management, as well as technology; a more effective process of managing manure; a lower dependence upon fossil-fuels and nonrenewable resources; a variation in the animals’ eating and drinking duration, time and location; and a cutback in, both, the production and consumption of animal-sourced foods.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn159" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn160" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn161" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn162" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="heat-stress">Heat stress</h3>

<p><a href="Heat_stress" title="wikilink">Heat stress</a> on livestock has a devastating effect on not only their growth and reproduction, but their food intake and production of dairy and meat. Cattle require a temperature range of 5-15 degrees Celsius, but upwards to 25 °C, to live comfortably, and once climate change increases the temperature, the chance of these changes occurring increases.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn163" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> Once the high temperatures hit, the livestock struggle to keep up their metabolism, resulting in decreased food intake, lowered activity rate, and a drop in weight. This causes a decline in livestock productivity and can be detrimental to the farmers and consumers. Obviously, the location and species of the livestock varies and therefore the effects of heat vary between them. This is noted in livestock at a higher elevation and in the <a class="uri" href="tropics" title="wikilink">tropics</a>, of which have a generally increased effect from climate change. Livestock in a higher elevation are very vulnerable to high heat and are not well adapted to those changes.</p>

<p>There are, however, some positive possible aspects to climate change as well. The projected increase in temperature during the first half of the century (1-3 °C) is expected to benefit crop and pasture yields in the <a href="temperate_region" title="wikilink">temperate regions</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn182" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn183" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn184" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> This will lead to higher winter temperatures and more frost-free days in these regions; resulting in a longer <a href="growing_season" title="wikilink">growing season</a>, increased thermal resources and accelerated maturation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn185" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn186" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a> If the climate scenario results in mild and wet weather, some areas and crops will suffer, but many may benefit from this.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn187" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="drought-and-flood">Drought and flood</h4>

<p>Extreme weather conditions continue to decrease crop yields in the form of <a class="uri" href="droughts" title="wikilink">droughts</a> and <a class="uri" href="floods" title="wikilink">floods</a>. While these weather events are becoming more common, there is still uncertainty and therefore a lack of preparedness as to when and where they will take place.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn188" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn189" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> In extreme cases, floods destroy crops, disrupting agricultural activities and rendering workers jobless and eliminating food supply. On the opposite end of the spectrum, droughts can also wipe out crops. It is estimated that 35-50% of the world’s crops are at risk of drought.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn190" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> <a href="Drought_in_Australia" title="wikilink">Australia</a> has been experiencing severe, recurrent droughts for a number of years, bringing serious despair to its farmers. The country’s rates of <a href="depression_(mood)" title="wikilink">depression</a> and <a href="domestic_violence" title="wikilink">domestic violence</a> are increasing and as of 2007, more than one hundred farmers had committed suicide as their thirsty crops slipped away.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn191" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> Drought is even more disastrous in the <a href="developing_world" title="wikilink">developing world</a>, exacerbating the pre-existing <a class="uri" href="poverty" title="wikilink">poverty</a> and fostering <a class="uri" href="famine" title="wikilink">famine</a> and <a class="uri" href="malnutrition" title="wikilink">malnutrition</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn192" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn193" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a></p>

<p>Droughts can cause farmers to rely more heavily on <a class="uri" href="irrigation" title="wikilink">irrigation</a>; this has downsides for both the individual farmers and the consumers. The equipment is expensive to install and some farmers may not have the financial ability to purchase it.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn194" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> The water itself must come from somewhere and if the area has been in a drought for any length of time, the rivers may be dry and the water must be transported from further distances. With 70% of “blue water” currently being used for global agriculture, any need over and above this could potentiate a <a href="water_crisis" title="wikilink">water crisis</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn195" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn196" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> In <a href="Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="wikilink">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>, water is used to flood <a href="rice_fields" title="wikilink">rice fields</a> to control the weed population; with the projection of less precipitation for this area, this historical method of weed control will no longer be possible.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn197" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a></p>

<p>With more costs to the farmer, some will no longer find it financially feasible to farm. <a class="uri" href="Agriculture" title="wikilink">Agriculture</a> employs the majority of the population in most low-income countries and increased costs can result in worker layoffs or pay cuts.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn198" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> Other farmers will respond by raising their food prices; a cost which is directly passed on to the consumer and impacts the affordability of food. Some farms do not export their goods and their function is to feed a direct family or community; without that food, people will not have enough to eat. This results in decreased production, increased food prices, and potential starvation in parts of the world.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn199" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="financial">Financial</h3>

<p>Some research suggests that initially climate change will help developing nations because some regions will be experiencing more negative climate change effects which will result in increased demand for food leading to higher prices and increased wages.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn200" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> However, many of the projected <a href="climate_change_scenario" title="wikilink">climate scenarios</a> suggest a huge financial burden. For example, the <a href="heat_wave" title="wikilink">heat wave</a> that passed through <a class="uri" href="Europe" title="wikilink">Europe</a> in 2003 cost 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn201" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> In addition, during <a href="El_Nino" title="wikilink">El Nino</a> weather conditions, the chance of the Australian farmer’s income falling below average increased by 75%, greatly impacting the country’s <a class="uri" href="GDP" title="wikilink">GDP</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn202" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> The agriculture industry in <a class="uri" href="India" title="wikilink">India</a> makes up 52% of their employment and the <a href="Canadian_Prairies" title="wikilink">Canadian Prairies</a> supply 51% of Canadian agriculture; any changes in the production of food crops from these areas could have profound effects on the <a class="uri" href="economy" title="wikilink">economy</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn203" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn204" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a> This could negatively affect the affordability of food and the subsequent health of the population.</p>
<h3 id="pests-and-pathogens">Pests and pathogens</h3>

<p>Currently, CO<sub>2</sub> levels are 40% higher than they were in <a href="pre-industrial_agriculture" title="wikilink">pre-industrial</a> times.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn205" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> This diminishes nutritional content for both human and insect consumption. Studies have shown that when CO<sub>2</sub> levels rise, <a class="uri" href="soybean" title="wikilink">soybean</a> leaves are less nutritious; therefore plant-eating beetles have to eat more to get their required <a class="uri" href="nutrients" title="wikilink">nutrients</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn206" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a> In addition, soybeans are less capable of defending themselves against the predatory insects under high CO<sub>2</sub>. The CO<sub>2</sub> diminishes the plant’s <a href="jasmonic_acid" title="wikilink">jasmonic acid</a> production, an insect-killing poison that is excreted when the plant senses it’s being attacked. Without this protection, beetles are able to eat the soybean leaves freely, resulting in a lower crop yield.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn207" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a> This is not a problem unique to soybeans, and many plant species’ defense mechanisms are impaired in a high CO<sub>2</sub> environment.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn208" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a></p>

<p>Currently, pathogens take 10-16% of the global harvest and this level is likely to rise as plants are at an ever-increasing risk of exposure to pests and pathogens.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn209" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> Historically, cold temperatures at night and in the winter months would kill off <a class="uri" href="insects" title="wikilink">insects</a>, <a class="uri" href="bacteria" title="wikilink">bacteria</a> and <a class="uri" href="fungi" title="wikilink">fungi</a>. The warmer, wetter winters are promoting fungal plant diseases like <a href="soybean_rust" title="wikilink">soybean rust</a> to travel northward. Soybean rust is a vicious plant pathogen that can kill off entire fields in a matter of days, devastating farmers and costing billions in agricultural losses. Another example is the <a href="Mountain_Pine_Beetle" title="wikilink">Mountain Pine Beetle</a> epidemic in <a href="BC,_Canada" title="wikilink">BC, Canada</a> which killed millions of pine trees because the winters were not cold enough to slow or kill the growing beetle larvae.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn210" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> The increasing incidence of flooding and heavy rains also promotes the growth of various other plant pests and diseases.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn211" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a> On the opposite end of the spectrum, drought conditions favour different kinds of pests like <a class="uri" href="aphids" title="wikilink">aphids</a>, <a class="uri" href="whiteflies" title="wikilink">whiteflies</a> and <a class="uri" href="locusts" title="wikilink">locusts</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn212" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a></p>

<p>The competitive balance between plants and pests has been relatively stable for the past century, but with the rapidly shifting climate, there is a change in this balance which often favours the more biologically diverse <a href="weed" title="wikilink">weeds</a> over the <a href="monocropping" title="wikilink">monocrops</a> most farms consist of.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn213" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a> Currently, weeds claim about one tenth of global crop yields annually as there are about eight to ten weed species in a field competing with crops.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn214" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a> Characteristics of weeds such as their <a href="genetic_diversity" title="wikilink">genetic diversity</a>, cross-breeding ability, and fast-growth rates put them at an advantage in changing climates as these characteristics allow them to adapt readily in comparison to most farm's uniform crops, and give them a biological advantage.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn215" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> There is also a shift in the distribution of pests as the altered climate makes areas previously uninhabitable more uninviting.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn216" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> Finally, with the increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels, <a class="uri" href="herbicides" title="wikilink">herbicides</a> will lose their efficiency which in turn increases the tolerance of weeds to herbicides.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn217" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a></p>

<p>Irakli Loladze explains that the lack of <a href="essential_nutrients" title="wikilink">essential nutrients</a> in crops contributes the problem of <a href="micronutrient_malnutrition" title="wikilink">micronutrient malnutrition</a> in society, commonly known as “hidden hunger”; despite adequate caloric intake, the body still is not nutritionally satisfied and therefore continues to be “hungry”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn221" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a> This problem is aggravated by the rising cost of food, resulting in a global shift towards diets which are less expensive, but high in <a class="uri" href="calories" title="wikilink">calories</a>, <a href="fat" title="wikilink">fats</a>, and animal products. This results in <a class="uri" href="undernutrition" title="wikilink">undernutrition</a> and an increase in <a class="uri" href="obesity" title="wikilink">obesity</a> and diet-related <a href="chronic_diseases" title="wikilink">chronic diseases</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn222" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn223" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a></p>

<p>Countries worldwide are already impacted by deficiencies in micronutrients and are seeing the effects in the health of their populations. <a href="Iron_deficiency" title="wikilink">Iron deficiency</a> affects more than 3.5 billion people; increasing <a href="maternal_mortality" title="wikilink">maternal mortality</a> and hindering <a href="cognitive_development" title="wikilink">cognitive development</a> in children, leading to education losses. <a href="Iodine_deficiency" title="wikilink">Iodine deficiency</a> leads to ailments like <a class="uri" href="goitre" title="wikilink">goitre</a>, <a href="brain_damage" title="wikilink">brain damage</a> and <a class="uri" href="cretinism" title="wikilink">cretinism</a> and is a problem in at least 130 different countries.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn224" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a> Even though these deficiencies are invisible, they have great potential to impact human health on a global scale.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most recent adverse effects of <a href="climate_change" title="wikilink">climate change</a> to be explored is that of <a href="ocean_acidification" title="wikilink">ocean acidification</a>. Our <a class="uri" href="oceans" title="wikilink">oceans</a> cover approximately 71 percent of the <a class="uri" href="Earth" title="wikilink">Earth</a>'s surface and support a diverse range of <a class="uri" href="ecosystems" title="wikilink">ecosystems</a>, which are home to over 50 percent of all the <a class="uri" href="species" title="wikilink">species</a> on the planet.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn247" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a> Oceans regulate <a class="uri" href="climate" title="wikilink">climate</a> and <a class="uri" href="weather" title="wikilink">weather</a> as well as providing <a class="uri" href="nutrition" title="wikilink">nutrition</a> for a vast variety of species, humans included.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn248" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a> Covering such an extensive part of the planet has allowed the oceans to absorb a large portion of the <a href="CO2_emissions" title="wikilink">carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</a> from the <a class="uri" href="atmosphere" title="wikilink">atmosphere</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn249" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a> This process is part of the <a href="carbon_cycle" title="wikilink">carbon cycle</a> in which the fluxes of <a href="CO2_emissions" title="wikilink">carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</a> in Earth's <a class="uri" href="atmosphere" title="wikilink">atmosphere</a>, <a class="uri" href="biosphere" title="wikilink">biosphere</a> and <a class="uri" href="lithosphere" title="wikilink">lithosphere</a> are described.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn250" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a> Humans have drastically added to the amount of <a href="CO2_emissions" title="wikilink">carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</a> in the atmosphere through the burning of <a href="fossil_fuels" title="wikilink">fossil fuels</a> and the process of <a class="uri" href="deforestation" title="wikilink">deforestation</a>. Oceans work as a sink absorbing excess <a href="human_impact_on_the_environment" title="wikilink">anthropogenic</a> <a href="carbon_dioxide" title="wikilink">carbon dioxide</a> (). As the oceans absorb <a href="human_impact_on_the_environment" title="wikilink">anthropogenic</a> <a href="carbon_dioxide" title="wikilink">carbon dioxide</a> () it breaks down into <a href="carbonic_acid" title="wikilink">carbonic acid</a>, a mild acid, this neutralizes the normally <a class="uri" href="alkaline" title="wikilink">alkaline</a> ocean water. As a result the pH in the oceans is declining. In the research surrounding global climate change we are only just beginning to realize that our oceans can sequester a finite amount of CO<sub>2</sub> before we start seeing impacts on marine life that could lead to devastating losses. Acidification of our oceans has the potential to drastically alter life as we know it - from <a href="extreme_weather" title="wikilink">extreme weather</a> patterns and <a href="food_scarcity" title="wikilink">food scarcity</a> to a loss of millions of species from the planet - all of these consequences hold the potential to directly affect <a href="human_health" title="wikilink">human health</a>.</p>
<h3 id="chemistry">Chemistry</h3>

<p>The mechanism by which CO<sub>2</sub> is absorbed into the ocean is basic chemistry. CO<sub>2</sub> combines with <a class="uri" href="water" title="wikilink">water</a> H<sub>2</sub>O to form <a href="carbonic_acid" title="wikilink">carbonic acid</a> () then eventually dissociates into <a class="uri" href="carbonate" title="wikilink">carbonate</a> () and <a class="uri" href="hydrogen" title="wikilink">hydrogen</a> ions (). The free <a class="uri" href="hydrogen" title="wikilink">hydrogen</a> ions () lower the <a class="uri" href="pH" title="wikilink">pH</a> of the surrounding waters making it acidic.

<p>Fish are not immune to ocean acidification either. Not only does the lower pH affect their food availability, it has also been shown to impair their senses.

<h3 id="human-health">Human health</h3>

<p>The health of our oceans has a direct effect on the health humans. According to Small and Nicholls, they estimated that 1.2 billion people worldwide, lived in the near-coastal region (within 100 km and 100m of the shoreline).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn276" id="fnref276"><sup>276</sup></a> This data was collected in 1990 and therefore is a conservative estimate in modern terms. In the U.S. alone 53% of the population lives within 50 miles of the coastal shoreline.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn277" id="fnref277"><sup>277</sup></a> Humans rely heavily on oceans for food, employment, recreation, weather patterns and transportation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn278" id="fnref278"><sup>278</sup></a> In the U.S. alone the lands adjacent to the oceans contribute over $1 trillion annually through these various activities not to mention pharmaceutical and medicinal discoveries.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn279" id="fnref279"><sup>279</sup></a> In all, the oceans are very important for our survival as a species.</p>
<h4 id="infiltrating-fresh-water-and-extreme-weather">Infiltrating fresh water and extreme weather</h4>

<p>With degradation of protective coral reefs through acidic erosion, bleaching and death, salt water is able to infiltrate fresh ground water supplies that large populations depend on.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn280" id="fnref280"><sup>280</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn281" id="fnref281"><sup>281</sup></a> Nowhere is this more evident than atoll islands. These islands possess limited freshwater supplies, namely ground water lenses and rain fall. When the protective coral reefs surrounding them erodes due to higher temperatures and acidic water chemistry, salt water is able to infiltrate the lens and contaminate the drinking water supply.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn282" id="fnref282"><sup>282</sup></a> In coastal Bangladesh it has been demonstrated that seasonal hypertension in pregnant women is connected with such phenomenon due to high sodium intake from drinking water.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn283" id="fnref283"><sup>283</sup></a> Reef erosion, coupled with sea level rise, tends to flood low lying areas more frequently during storm surges and weather events. Warming ocean waters generate larger and more devastating weather events that can decimate coastal populations especially without the protection of coral reefs.</p>
<h3 id="food-safety">Food safety</h3>

<p>Our insatiable appetite for seafood of all types has led to overfishing and has already significantly strained marine food stocks to the point of collapse in many cases. With seafood being a major protein source for so much of the population, there are inherent health risks associated with global warming. As mentioned above increased agricultural runoff and warmer water temperature allows for eutrophication of ocean waters. This increased growth of algae and phytoplankton in turn can have dire consequences. These algal blooms can emit toxic substances that can be harmful to humans if consumed. Organisms, such as shellfish, marine crustaceans and even fish, feed on or near these infected blooms, ingest the toxins and can be consumed unknowingly by humans. One of these toxin producing algae is Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta. This species produces a substance called <a href="domoic_acid" title="wikilink">domoic acid</a> which is responsible for <a href="amnesic_shellfish_poisoning" title="wikilink">amnesic shellfish poisoning</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn284" id="fnref284"><sup>284</sup></a> The toxicity of this species has been shown to increase with greater CO2 concentrations associated with ocean acidification.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn285" id="fnref285"><sup>285</sup></a> Some of the more common illnesses reported from harmful algal blooms include; <a href="Ciguatera_fish_poisoning" title="wikilink">Ciguatera fish poisoning</a>, <a href="paralytic_shellfish_poisoning" title="wikilink">paralytic shellfish poisoning</a>, azaspiracid shellfish poisoning, <a href="diarrhetic_shellfish_poisoning" title="wikilink">diarrhetic shellfish poisoning</a>, <a href="neurotoxic_shellfish_poisoning" title="wikilink">neurotoxic shellfish poisoning</a> and the above-mentioned amnesic shellfish poisoning.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn286" id="fnref286"><sup>286</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="extreme-weather-events">Extreme weather events</h2>

<p>Infectious disease often accompanies <a href="extreme_weather" title="wikilink">extreme weather</a> events, such as floods, earthquakes and drought. These local epidemics occur due to loss of infrastructure, such as hospitals and sanitation services, but also because of changes in local ecology and environment. For example, malaria outbreaks have been strongly associated with the El Niño cycles of a number of countries (India and Venezuela, for example). <a href="El_Niño-Southern_Oscillation" title="wikilink">El Niño</a> can lead to drastic, though temporary, changes in the environment such as temperature fluctuations and <a href="flash_flood" title="wikilink">flash floods</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn287" id="fnref287"><sup>287</sup></a> Because of global warming there has been a marked trend towards more variable and anomalous weather. This has led to an increase in the number and severity of extreme weather events. This trend towards more variability and fluctuation is perhaps more important, in terms of its impact on human health, than that of a gradual and long-term trend towards higher average temperature.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn288" id="fnref288"><sup>288</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="drought">Drought</h3>

<p>Arguably one of the worst effects that drought has directly on human health is the destruction of food supply. Farmers who depend on weather to water their crops lose tons of crops per year due to drought. Plant growth is severely stunted without adequate water, and plant resistance mechanisms to fungi and insects weaken like human immune systems. The expression of genes is altered by increased temperatures, which can also affect a plant’s resistance mechanisms. One example is wheat, which has the ability to express genes that make it resistant to leaf and stem rusts, and to the Hessian fly; its resistance declines with increasing temperatures. A number of other factors associated with lack of water may actually attract pestilent insects, as well- some studies have shown that many insects are attracted to yellow hues, including the yellowing leaves of drought-stressed plants. During times of mild drought is when conditions are most suitable to insect infestation in crops; once the plants become too weakened, they lack the nutrients necessary to keep the insects healthy. This means that even a relatively short, mild drought may cause enormous damage- even though the drought on its own may not be enough to kill a significant portion of the crops, once the plants become weakened, they are at higher risk of becoming infested.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn289" id="fnref289"><sup>289</sup></a></p>

<p>The results of the loss of crop yields affect everyone, but they can be felt most by the poorest people in the world. As supplies of corn, flour and vegetables decline, world food prices are driven up. Malnutrition rates in poor areas of the world skyrocket, and with this, dozens of associated diseases and health problems. Immune function decreases, so mortality rates due to infectious and other diseases climb. For those whose incomes were affected by droughts (namely agriculturalists and pastoralists), and for those who can barely afford the increased food prices, the cost to see a doctor or visit a clinic can simply be out of reach. Without treatment, some of these diseases can hinder one’s ability to work, decreasing future opportunities for income and perpetuating the vicious cycle of poverty.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn290" id="fnref290"><sup>290</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="floods">Floods</h3>

<p><a class="uri" href="Health" title="wikilink">Health</a> concerns around the world can be linked to <a class="uri" href="floods" title="wikilink">floods</a>. With the increase in temperatures world wide due to climate change the increase in flooding is unavoidable.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn291" id="fnref291"><sup>291</sup></a> <a class="uri" href="Floods" title="wikilink">Floods</a> have short and long term negative implications to peoples' health and well being. Short term implications include <a href="Death" title="wikilink">mortalities</a>, <a class="uri" href="injuries" title="wikilink">injuries</a> and <a class="uri" href="diseases" title="wikilink">diseases</a>, while long term implications include <a href="non-communicable_diseases" title="wikilink">non-communicable diseases</a> and <a class="uri" href="psychosocial" title="wikilink">psychosocial</a> health aspects.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn292" id="fnref292"><sup>292</sup></a></p>

<p>Mortalities are not uncommon when it comes to floods. The Countries with lower <a class="uri" href="incomes" title="wikilink">incomes</a> are more likely to have more <a href="Death" title="wikilink">fatalities</a>, because of the lack of <a class="uri" href="resources" title="wikilink">resources</a> they have and the supplies to prepare for a flood. This does depend on the type and properties of the flood. For example if there is a <a href="flash_flood" title="wikilink">flash flood</a> it would not matter how prepared you are. Fatalities connected directly to floods are usually caused by <a class="uri" href="drowning" title="wikilink">drowning</a>; the waters in a flood are very deep and have strong <a href="current_(fluid)" title="wikilink">currents</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn293" id="fnref293"><sup>293</sup></a> <a class="uri" href="Deaths" title="wikilink">Deaths</a> do not just occur from drowning, deaths are connected with <a class="uri" href="dehydration" title="wikilink">dehydration</a>, <a href="heat_stroke" title="wikilink">heat stroke</a>, <a href="heart_attack" title="wikilink">heart attack</a> and any other <a class="uri" href="illness" title="wikilink">illness</a> that needs <a href="medical_supplies" title="wikilink">medical supplies</a> that cannot be delivered.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn294" id="fnref294"><sup>294</sup></a></p>

<p>Injuries can lead to an excessive amount of morbidity when a flood occurs.

<h2 id="displacementmigration">Displacement/migration</h2>

<p>Climate change causes displacement of people in several ways, the most obvious—and dramatic—being through the increased number and severity of weather-related disasters which destroy homes and habitats causing people to seek shelter or livelihoods elsewhere. Slow onset phenomena, including effects of climate change such as <a class="uri" href="desertification" title="wikilink">desertification</a> and <a href="rising_sea_levels" title="wikilink">rising sea levels</a> gradually erode livelihoods and force communities to abandon traditional homelands for more accommodating environments. This is currently happening in areas of Africa’s <a class="uri" href="Sahel" title="wikilink">Sahel</a>, the semi-arid belt that spans the continent just below its northern deserts. Deteriorating environments triggered by climate change can also lead to increased conflict over resources which in turn can displace people.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn416" id="fnref416"><sup>416</sup></a></p>

<p>Extreme environmental events are increasingly recognized as a key driver of migration across the world. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, more than 42 million people were displaced in Asia and the Pacific during 2010 and 2011, more than twice the population of Sri Lanka. This figure includes those displaced by storms, floods, and heat and cold waves. Still others were displaced drought and sea-level rise. Most of those compelled to leave their homes eventually returned when conditions improved, but an undetermined number became migrants, usually within their country, but also across national borders.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn417" id="fnref417"><sup>417</sup></a></p>

<p>Asia and the Pacific is the global area most prone to natural disasters, both in terms of the absolute number of disasters and of populations affected. It is highly exposed to climate impacts, and is home to highly vulnerable population groups, who are disproportionately poor and marginalized. A recent Asian Development Bank report highlights “environmental hot spots” that are particular risk of flooding, <a class="uri" href="cyclones" title="wikilink">cyclones</a>, <a class="uri" href="typhoons" title="wikilink">typhoons</a>, and water stress.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn418" id="fnref418"><sup>418</sup></a></p>

<p>To reduce migration compelled by worsening environmental conditions, and to strengthen resilience of at-risk communities, governments should adopt polices and commit financing to social protection, livelihoods development, basic urban infrastructure development, and disaster risk management. Though every effort should be made to ensure that people can stay where they live, it is also important to recognize that migration can also be a way for people to cope with environmental changes. If properly managed, and efforts made to protect the rights of migrants, migration can provide substantial benefits to both origin and destination areas, as well as to the migrants themselves. However, migrants – particularly low-skilled ones – are among the most vulnerable people in society and are often denied basic protections and access to services.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn419" id="fnref419"><sup>419</sup></a></p>

<p>The links between the gradual environmental degradation of climate change and displacement are complex: as the decision to migrate is taken at the household level, it is difficult to measure the respective influence of climate change in these decisions with regard to other influencing factors, such as <a class="uri" href="poverty" title="wikilink">poverty</a>, <a href="population_growth" title="wikilink">population growth</a> or <a class="uri" href="employment" title="wikilink">employment</a> options.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn420" id="fnref420"><sup>420</sup></a> This situates the debate on <a href="environmental_migrant" title="wikilink">environmental migration</a> in a highly contested field: the use of the term 'environmental refugee', although commonly used in some contexts, is disrecommended by agencies such as the <a class="uri" href="UNHCR" title="wikilink">UNHCR</a> who argue that the term 'refugee' has a strict legal definition which does not apply to environmental migrants.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn421" id="fnref421"><sup>421</sup></a> Neither the <a href="UN_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change" title="wikilink">UN Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> nor the <a href="Kyoto_Protocol" title="wikilink">Kyoto Protocol</a>, an international agreement on climate change, includes any provisions concerning specific assistance or protection for those who will be directly affected by climate change.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn422" id="fnref422"><sup>422</sup></a></p>
