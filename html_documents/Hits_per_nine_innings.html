<h1>Hits per nine innings</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a href="baseball_statistics" title="wikilink">baseball statistics</a>, <strong>hits per nine innings</strong> (denoted by <strong>H/9</strong>) is the average number of <a href="Hit_(baseball_statistics)" title="wikilink">hits</a> allowed by a <a class="uri" href="pitcher" title="wikilink">pitcher</a> in a nine inning period; calculated as: (hits allowed x 9) / <a href="innings_pitched" title="wikilink">innings pitched</a>. This is a measure of a pitcher's success based on the number of all outs he records.</p>

<p>Compared to a pitcher's <a href="batting_average_against" title="wikilink">batting average against</a>, a pitcher's H/9 benefits from <a href="sacrifice_bunt" title="wikilink">sacrifice bunts</a>, <a href="double_play" title="wikilink">double plays</a>, runners <a href="caught_stealing" title="wikilink">caught stealing</a>, and <a href="assist_(baseball)" title="wikilink">outfield assists</a>, but it is hurt by some <a href="error_(baseball)" title="wikilink">errors</a>. Unlike batting average against, a pitcher's H/9 benefits from outs that are not related to official at bats, as they are recorded on runners after they have reached base.</p>
