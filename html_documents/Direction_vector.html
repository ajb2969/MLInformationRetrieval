 are two distinct points on the line. If <strong>v</strong> is a direction vector for <em>D</em>, so is <em>k</em><strong>v</strong> for any nonzero <a href="scalar_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">scalar</a> <em>k</em>; and these are in fact <em>all</em> of the direction vectors for the line <em>D</em>. Under some definitions, the direction vector is required to be a unit vector, in which case each line has exactly two direction vectors, which are negatives of each other (equal in magnitude, opposite in direction).</p>
<h2 id="parametric-equation-for-a-line">Parametric equation for a line</h2>

<p>In <a href="Euclidean_space" title="wikilink">Euclidean space</a> (any number of dimensions), given a point <strong>a</strong> and a nonzero vector <strong>v</strong>, a line is defined <a href="parametric_equation" title="wikilink">parametrically</a> by (<strong>a</strong>+t<strong>v</strong>), where the parameter <em>t</em> varies between -∞ and +∞. This line has <strong>v</strong> as a direction vector.</p>
<h2 id="generative-versus-predicate-forms">Generative versus predicate forms</h2>

<p>The line equation <strong>a</strong>+t<strong>v</strong> is a generative form, but not a predicate form. Points may be generated along the line given values for <strong>a</strong>, t and <strong>v</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>p</strong> ← <strong>a</strong> +t<strong>v</strong></p>

<p>However, in order to function as a predicate, the representation must be sufficient to easily determine ( T / F ) whether any specified point <strong>p</strong> is on the line. If you substitute a known point into the above equation, it cannot be evaluated for equality because t was not supplied, only <strong>p</strong> .</p>
<h2 id="predicate-form-of-2d-line-equation">Predicate form of 2D line equation</h2>

<p>An example of a predicate form of the vector line equation in 2D is:</p>

<p><strong>p</strong> • <strong>o</strong> == L</p>

<p>Here, the line is represented by two features: <strong>o</strong> and L.</p>

<p><strong>o</strong> is the line's orientation, a normalized direction vector (unit vector) pointing perpendicular to its run direction.</p>

<p>The orientation is computed using the same two quantities dx and dy that go into computing slope m:</p>

<p><strong>o</strong> ← ( dy , -dx ) norm = ( dy , -dx ) / || ( dy , -dx ) || (orientation of a 2D line)</p>

<p>Orientation <strong>o</strong> has the advantage of not overcompressing the information vested in dx and dy into a single scalar as slope does, avoiding the need to appeal to infinity as a value. Numerical algorithms benefit by avoiding such ill-behaved exceptions (e.g. , slope of a vertical line).</p>

<p>The 2nd feature of a 2D line represented this way is its location L. Intuitively and visually, L is the signed distance of the line from the origin (with positive distance increasing along direction <strong>o</strong>). Orientation must be solved before determining location. Once <strong>o</strong> is known, L can be computed given any known point <strong>p</strong> on the line:</p>

<p>L ← <strong>p</strong> • <strong>o</strong> (location of a 2D line)</p>

<p>Lines may be represented as feature pair ( <strong>o</strong> , L ) in all cases. Every line has an equivalent representation ( <strong>-o</strong> , -L ).</p>

<p>To determine if a point <strong>p</strong> is on the line, plug the value of <strong>p</strong> into the vector line predicate and evaluate it:</p>

<p><strong>p</strong> • <strong>o</strong> == L (vector line predicate)</p>

<p>In computation, the predicate must tolerate finite math error by incorporating an epsilon signifying acceptable equality:</p>

<p>abs (<strong>p</strong> • <strong>o</strong> - L) </p>
