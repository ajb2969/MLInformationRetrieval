<p>In <a href="Maxwell's_equations" title="wikilink">classical electromagnetism</a>, <strong>reciprocity</strong> refers to a variety of related theorems involving the interchange of time-<a href="harmonic_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">harmonic</a> electric <a href="current_density" title="wikilink">current densities</a> (sources) and the resulting <a href="electromagnetic_field" title="wikilink">electromagnetic fields</a> in <a href="Maxwell's_equations" title="wikilink">Maxwell's equations</a> for time-invariant linear media under certain constraints. Reciprocity is closely related to the concept of <a href="Hermitian_operator" title="wikilink">Hermitian operators</a> from <a href="linear_algebra" title="wikilink">linear algebra</a>, applied to electromagnetism.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most common and general such theorem is <strong>Lorentz reciprocity</strong> (and its various special cases such as <strong>Rayleigh-Carson reciprocity</strong>), named after work by <a href="Hendrik_Lorentz" title="wikilink">Hendrik Lorentz</a> in 1896 following analogous results regarding <a class="uri" href="sound" title="wikilink">sound</a> by <a href="Lord_Rayleigh" title="wikilink">Lord Rayleigh</a> and <a class="uri" href="Helmholtz" title="wikilink">Helmholtz</a> (Potton, 2004). Loosely, it states that the relationship between an oscillating current and the resulting <a href="electric_field" title="wikilink">electric field</a> is unchanged if one interchanges the points where the current is placed and where the field is measured. For the specific case of an <a href="electrical_network" title="wikilink">electrical network</a>, it is sometimes phrased as the statement that <a href="voltage" title="wikilink">voltages</a> and <a href="Current_(electricity)" title="wikilink">currents</a> at different points in the network can be interchanged. More technically, it follows that the <a href="mutual_impedance" title="wikilink">mutual impedance</a> of a first circuit due to a second is the same as the mutual impedance of the second circuit due to the first.</p>
<p>Reciprocity is useful in <a class="uri" href="optics" title="wikilink">optics</a>, which (apart from quantum effects) can be expressed in terms of classical electromagnetism, but also in terms of <a class="uri" href="radiometry" title="wikilink">radiometry</a>.</p>
<p>There is also an analogous theorem in <a class="uri" href="electrostatics" title="wikilink">electrostatics</a>, known as <strong>Green's reciprocity</strong>, relating the interchange of <a href="electric_potential" title="wikilink">electric potential</a> and <a href="electric_charge_density" title="wikilink">electric charge density</a>.</p>
<p>Forms of the reciprocity theorems are used in many electromagnetic applications, such as analyzing electrical networks and <a href="antenna_(radio)" title="wikilink">antenna</a> systems. For example, reciprocity implies that antennas work equally well as transmitters or receivers, and specifically that an antenna's <a href="radiation_pattern" title="wikilink">radiation and receiving patterns</a> are identical. Reciprocity is also a basic lemma that is used to prove other theorems about electromagnetic systems, such as the symmetry of the <a href="impedance_parameters" title="wikilink">impedance matrix</a> and <a href="scattering_parameters" title="wikilink">scattering matrix</a>, symmetries of <a href="Green's_function" title="wikilink">Green's functions</a> for use in <a href="boundary_element_method" title="wikilink">boundary-element</a> and transfer-matrix computational methods, as well as <a class="uri" href="orthogonality" title="wikilink">orthogonality</a> properties of <a href="harmonic_mode" title="wikilink">harmonic modes</a> in <a class="uri" href="waveguide" title="wikilink">waveguide</a> systems (as an alternative to proving those properties directly from the symmetries of the <a href="Eigenvalue,_eigenvector_and_eigenspace" title="wikilink">eigen-operators</a>).</p>
<h2 id="lorentz-reciprocity">Lorentz reciprocity</h2>
<p>Specifically, suppose that one has a current density <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{J}_1$</span> that produces an <a href="electric_field" title="wikilink">electric field</a> <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{E}_1$</span> and a <a href="magnetic_field" title="wikilink">magnetic field</a> <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{H}_1$</span>, where all three are periodic functions of time with <a href="angular_frequency" title="wikilink">angular frequency</a> ω, and in particular they have time-dependence <span class="LaTeX">$\exp(-i\omega t)$</span>. Suppose that we similarly have a second current <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{J}_2$</span> at the same frequency ω which (by itself) produces fields <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{E}_2$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{H}_2$</span>. The Lorentz reciprocity theorem then states, under certain simple conditions on the materials of the medium described below, that for an arbitrary surface <em>S</em> enclosing a volume <em>V</em>:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_V \left[ \mathbf{J}_1 \cdot \mathbf{E}_2 - \mathbf{E}_1 \cdot \mathbf{J}_2 \right] dV = \oint_S \left[ \mathbf{E}_1 \times \mathbf{H}_2 - \mathbf{E}_2 \times \mathbf{H}_1 \right] \cdot \mathbf{dS} .$$</span></p>
<p>Equivalently, in differential form (by the <a href="divergence_theorem" title="wikilink">divergence theorem</a>):</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\mathbf{J}_1 \cdot \mathbf{E}_2 - \mathbf{E}_1 \cdot \mathbf{J}_2 = \nabla \cdot \left[ \mathbf{E}_1 \times \mathbf{H}_2 - \mathbf{E}_2 \times \mathbf{H}_1 \right] .$$</span></p>
<p>This general form is commonly simplified for a number of special cases. In particular, one usually assumes that <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{J}_1$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{J}_2$</span> are localized (i.e. have <a href="compact_support" title="wikilink">compact support</a>), and that there are no incoming waves from infinitely far away. In this case, if one integrates over all space then the surface-integral terms cancel (see below) and one obtains:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int \mathbf{J}_1 \cdot \mathbf{E}_2 \, dV = \int \mathbf{E}_1 \cdot \mathbf{J}_2 \, dV.$$</span></p>
<p>This result (along with the following simplifications) is sometimes called the <strong>Rayleigh-Carson reciprocity theorem</strong>, after Lord Rayleigh's work on sound waves and an extension by <a href="John_R._Carson" title="wikilink">John R. Carson</a> (1924; 1930) to applications for <a href="radio_frequency" title="wikilink">radio frequency</a> antennas. Often, one further simplifies this relation by considering point-like <a class="uri" href="dipole" title="wikilink">dipole</a> sources, in which case the integrals disappear and one simply has the product of the electric field with the corresponding dipole moments of the currents. Or, for wires of negligible thickness, one obtains the applied current in one wire multiplied by the resulting voltage across another and vice versa; see also below.</p>
<p>Another special case of the Lorentz reciprocity theorem applies when the volume <em>V</em> entirely contains <em>both</em> of the localized sources (or alternatively if <em>V</em> intersects <em>neither</em> of the sources). In this case:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\oint_S (\mathbf{E}_1 \times \mathbf{H}_2) \cdot \mathbf{dS} = \oint_S (\mathbf{E}_2 \times \mathbf{H}_1) \cdot \mathbf{dS}.$$</span></p>
<h2 id="reciprocity-for-electrical-networks">Reciprocity for electrical networks</h2>
<p>Above, Lorentz reciprocity was phrased in terms of an externally applied current source and the resulting field. Often, especially for electrical networks, one instead prefers to think of an externally applied voltage and the resulting currents. The Lorentz reciprocity theorem describes this case as well, assuming <a href="Ohm's_law" title="wikilink">ohmic materials</a> (i.e. currents that respond linearly to the applied field) with a 3×3 <a href="Electrical_conductivity" title="wikilink">conductivity</a> matrix σ that is required to be <a href="symmetric_matrix" title="wikilink">symmetric</a>, which is implied by the other conditions below. In order to properly describe this situation, one must carefully distinguish between the externally <em>applied</em> fields (from the driving voltages) and the <em>total</em> fields that result (King, 1963).</p>
<p>More specifically, the <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{J}$</span> above only consisted of external "source" terms introduced into Maxwell's equations. We now denote this by <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{J}^{(e)}$</span> to distinguish it from the <em>total</em> current produced by both the external source and by the resulting electric fields in the materials. If this external current is in a material with a conductivity σ, then it corresponds to an externally applied electric field <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{E}^{(e)}$</span> where, by definition of σ:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\mathbf{J}^{(e)}=\sigma\mathbf{E}^{(e)}.$$</span></p>
<p>Moreover, the electric field <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{E}$</span> above only consisted of the <em>response</em> to this current, and did not include the "external" field <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{E}^{(e)}$</span>. Therefore, we now denote the field from before as <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{E}^{(r)}$</span>, where the <em>total</em> field is given by <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{E}^{(e)} + \mathbf{E}^{(r)}$</span>.</p>
<p>Now, the equation on the left-hand side of the Lorentz reciprocity theorem can be rewritten by moving the σ from the external current term <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{J}^{(e)}$</span> to the response field terms <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{E}^{(r)}$</span>, and also adding and subtracting a <span class="LaTeX">$\sigma\mathbf{E}_1^{(e)}\mathbf{E}_2^{(e)}$</span> term, to obtain the external field multiplied by the <em>total</em> current <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{J}=\sigma\mathbf{E}$</span>:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_V \left[ \mathbf{J}_1^{(e)} \cdot \mathbf{E}_2^{(r)} - \mathbf{E}_1^{(r)} \cdot \mathbf{J}_2^{(e)} \right] dV
= \int_V \left[ \sigma \mathbf{E}_1^{(e)} \cdot (\mathbf{E}_2^{(r)} + \mathbf{E}_2^{(e)}) -  (\mathbf{E}_1^{(r)} + \mathbf{E}_1^{(e)}) \cdot \sigma\mathbf{E}_2^{(e)} \right] dV$$</span></p>
<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$= \int_V \left[ \mathbf{E}_1^{(e)} \cdot \mathbf{J}_2 - \mathbf{J}_1 \cdot \mathbf{E}_2^{(e)} \right] dV.$</span>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>For the limit of thin wires, this gives the product of the externally applied voltage (1) multiplied by the resulting total current (2) and vice versa. In particular, the Rayleigh-Carson reciprocity theorem becomes a simple summation:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\sum_n V_1^{(n)} I_2^{(n)} = \sum_n V_2^{(n)} I_1^{(n)} \!$$</span></p>
<p>where <em>V</em> and <em>I</em> denote the <a href="complex_amplitudes" title="wikilink">complex amplitudes</a> of the <a href="alternating_current" title="wikilink">AC</a> applied voltages and the resulting currents, respectively, in a set of circuit elements (indexed by <em>n</em>) for two possible sets of voltages <span class="LaTeX">$V_1$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$V_2$</span>.</p>
<p>Most commonly, this is simplified further to the case where each system has a <em>single</em> voltage source <em>V</em>, at <span class="LaTeX">$V_1^{(1)}=V$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$V_2^{(2)}=V$</span>. Then the theorem becomes simply</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$I_1^{(2)}=I_2^{(1)}$$</span> or in words:</p>
<dl>
<dd><strong>The current at position (1) from a voltage at (2) is identical to the current at (2) from the same voltage at (1).</strong>

<h2 id="conditions-and-proof-of-lorentz-reciprocity">Conditions and proof of Lorentz reciprocity</h2>
<p>The Lorentz reciprocity theorem is simply a reflection of the fact that the linear operator <span class="LaTeX">$\hat{O}$</span> relating <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{J}$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{E}$</span> at a fixed frequency (in linear media):</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\mathbf{J} = \frac{1}{i\omega} \left[ \left( \nabla \times \frac{1}{\mu} \nabla \times \right) - \; \omega^2 \varepsilon \right] \mathbf{E} \equiv \hat{O}\mathbf{E}$$</span></p>
<p>is usually a <a href="Hermitian_operator" title="wikilink">Hermitian operator</a> under the <a href="inner_product" title="wikilink">inner product</a> <span class="LaTeX">$(\mathbf{F}, \mathbf{G}) = \int \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{G} \, dV$</span> for <a href="vector_field" title="wikilink">vector fields</a> <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{F}$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{G}$</span>. (Technically, this <a href="Complex_conjugate" title="wikilink">unconjugated</a> form is not a true inner product because it is not real-valued for complex-valued fields, but that is not a problem here. In this sense, the operator is not truly Hermitian but is rather complex-symmetric.) This is true whenever the <a class="uri" href="permittivity" title="wikilink">permittivity</a> ε and the <a href="magnetic_permeability" title="wikilink">magnetic permeability</a> μ, at the given ω, are <a href="symmetric_matrix" title="wikilink">symmetric</a> 3×3 matrices (symmetric rank-2 tensors) — this includes the common case where they are <a href="scalar_(physics)" title="wikilink">scalars</a> (for isotropic media), of course. They need <em>not</em> be real—complex values correspond to materials with losses, such as conductors with finite conductivity σ (which is included in ε via <span class="LaTeX">$\varepsilon \rightarrow \varepsilon + i\sigma/\omega$</span>)—and because of this the reciprocity theorem does <em>not</em> require <a href="time_reversal_invariance" title="wikilink">time reversal invariance</a>. The condition of symmetric ε and μ matrices is almost always satisfied; see below for an exception.</p>
<p>For any Hermitian operator <span class="LaTeX">$\hat{O}$</span> under an inner product <span class="LaTeX">$(f,g)\!$</span>, we have <span class="LaTeX">$(f,\hat{O}g) = (\hat{O}f,g)$</span> by definition, and the Rayleigh-Carson reciprocity theorem is merely the vectorial version of this statement for this particular operator <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{J} = \hat{O} \mathbf{E}$</span>: that is, <span class="LaTeX">$(\mathbf{E}_1, \hat{O} \mathbf{E}_2) = (\hat{O} \mathbf{E}_1, \mathbf{E}_2)$</span>. The Hermitian property of the operator here can be derived by <a href="integration_by_parts" title="wikilink">integration by parts</a>. For a finite integration volume, the surface terms from this integration by parts yield the more-general surface-integral theorem above. In particular, the key fact is that, for vector fields <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{F}$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{G}$</span>, integration by parts (or the <a href="divergence_theorem" title="wikilink">divergence theorem</a>) over a volume <em>V</em> enclosed by a surface <em>S</em> gives the identity:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_V \mathbf{F} \cdot (\nabla\times\mathbf{G}) \, dV = \int_V (\nabla\times\mathbf{F}) \cdot \mathbf{G} \, dV - \oint_S (\mathbf{F} \times \mathbf{G}) \cdot \mathbf{dA}.$$</span></p>
<p>This identity is then applied twice to <span class="LaTeX">$(\mathbf{E}_1, \hat{O} \mathbf{E}_2)$</span> to yield <span class="LaTeX">$(\hat{O} \mathbf{E}_1, \mathbf{E}_2)$</span> plus the surface term, giving the Lorentz reciprocity relation.</p>
<h3 id="surface-term-cancellation">Surface-term cancellation</h3>
<p>The cancellation of the surface terms on the right-hand side of the Lorentz reciprocity theorem, for an integration over all space, is not entirely obvious but can be derived in a number of ways.</p>
<p>The simplest argument would be that the fields goes to zero at infinity for a localized source, but this argument fails in the case of lossless media: in the absence of absorption, radiated fields decay inversely with distance, but the surface area of the integral increases with the square of distance, so the two rates balance one another in the integral.</p>
<p>Instead, it is common (e.g. King, 1963) to assume that the medium is homogeneous and isotropic sufficiently far away. In this case, the radiated field asymptotically takes the form of <a href="planewave" title="wikilink">planewaves</a> propagating radially outward (in the <span class="LaTeX">$\hat{\mathbf{r}}$</span> direction) with <span class="LaTeX">$\hat{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{H} = \hat{\mathbf{r}} \times \mathbf{E} / Z$</span> where <em>Z</em> is the <a href="Electrical_impedance" title="wikilink">impedance</a> <span class="LaTeX">$\sqrt{\mu/\epsilon}$</span> of the surrounding medium. Then it follows that <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{E}_1 \times \mathbf{H}_2 = \mathbf{E}_1 \times \hat{\mathbf{r}} \times \mathbf{E}_2 / Z$</span>, which by a simple <a href="Cross_product#Lagrange's_formula" title="wikilink">vector identity</a> equals <span class="LaTeX">$\hat{\mathbf{r}} (\mathbf{E}_1 \cdot \mathbf{E}_2) / Z$</span>. Similarly, <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{E}_2 \times \mathbf{H}_1 = \hat{\mathbf{r}} (\mathbf{E}_2 \cdot \mathbf{E}_1) / Z$</span> and the two terms cancel one another.</p>
<p>The above argument shows explicitly why the surface terms can cancel, but lacks generality. Alternatively, one can treat the case of lossless surrounding media by taking the limit as the losses (the imaginary part of ε) go to zero. For any nonzero loss, the fields decay exponentially with distance and the surface integral vanishes, regardless of whether the medium is homogeneous. Since the left-hand side of the Lorentz reciprocity theorem vanishes for integration over all space with any non-zero losses, it must also vanish in the limit as the losses go to zero. (Note that we implicitly assumed the standard boundary condition of zero incoming waves from infinity, because otherwise even an infinitesimal loss would eliminate the incoming waves and the limit would not give the lossless solution.)</p>
<h3 id="reciprocity-and-the-greens-function">Reciprocity and the Green's function</h3>
<p>The inverse of the operator <span class="LaTeX">$\hat{O}$</span>, i.e. in <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{E} = \hat{O}^{-1} \mathbf{J}$</span> (which requires a specification of the boundary conditions at infinity in a lossless system), has the same symmetry as <span class="LaTeX">$\hat{O}$</span> and is essentially a <a href="Green's_function" title="wikilink">Green's function</a> <a class="uri" href="convolution" title="wikilink">convolution</a>. So, another perspective on Lorentz reciprocity is that it reflects the fact that convolution with the electromagnetic Green's function is a complex-symmetric (or anti-Hermitian, below) linear operation under the appropriate conditions on ε and μ. More specifically, the Green's function can be written as <span class="LaTeX">$G_{nm}(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x})$</span> giving the <em>n</em>-th component of <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{E}$</span> at <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{x}'$</span> from a point dipole current in the <em>m</em>-th direction at <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{x}$</span> (essentially, <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> gives the matrix elements of <span class="LaTeX">$\hat{O}^{-1}$</span>), and Rayleigh-Carson reciprocity is equivalent to the statement that <span class="LaTeX">$G_{nm}(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x}) = G_{mn}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')$</span>. Unlike <span class="LaTeX">$\hat{O}$</span>, it is not generally possible to give an explicit formula for the Green's function (except in special cases such as homogeneous media), but it is routinely computed by numerical methods.</p>
<h3 id="lossless-magneto-optic-materials">Lossless magneto-optic materials</h3>
<p>One case in which ε is <em>not</em> a symmetric matrix is for <a class="uri" href="magneto-optic" title="wikilink">magneto-optic</a> materials, in which case the usual statement of Lorentz reciprocity does not hold (see below for a generalization, however). If we allow magneto-optic materials, but restrict ourselves to the situation where material <em>absorption is negligible</em>, then ε and μ are in general 3×3 complex <a href="Hermitian_matrices" title="wikilink">Hermitian matrices</a>. In this case the operator <span class="LaTeX">$\nabla \times \frac{1}{\mu} \nabla \times - (\omega^2/c^2) \varepsilon$</span> is Hermitian under the <em>conjugated</em> inner product <span class="LaTeX">$(\mathbf{F}, \mathbf{G}) = \int \mathbf{F}^* \cdot \mathbf{G} \, dV$</span>, and a variant of the reciprocity theorem still holds:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$- \int_V \left[ \mathbf{J}_1^* \cdot \mathbf{E}_2 + \mathbf{E}_1^* \cdot \mathbf{J}_2 \right] dV = \oint_S \left[ \mathbf{E}_1^* \times \mathbf{H}_2 + \mathbf{E}_2 \times \mathbf{H}_1^* \right] \cdot \mathbf{dA}$$</span></p>
<p>where the sign changes come from the <span class="LaTeX">$1/i\omega$</span> in the equation above, which makes the operator <span class="LaTeX">$\hat{O}$</span> <a class="uri" href="anti-Hermitian" title="wikilink">anti-Hermitian</a> (neglecting surface terms). For the special case of <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{J}_1=\mathbf{J}_2$</span>, this gives a re-statement of <a href="conservation_of_energy" title="wikilink">conservation of energy</a> or <a href="Poynting's_theorem" title="wikilink">Poynting's theorem</a> (since here we have assumed lossless materials, unlike above): the time-average rate of work done by the current (given by the real part of <span class="LaTeX">$-\mathbf{J}^* \cdot \mathbf{E}$</span>) is equal to the time-average outward flux of power (the integral of the <a href="Poynting_vector" title="wikilink">Poynting vector</a>). By the same token, however, the surface terms do not in general vanish if one integrates over all space for this reciprocity variant, so a Rayleigh-Carson form does not hold without additional assumptions.</p>
<p>The fact that magneto-optic materials break Rayleigh-Carson reciprocity is the key to devices such as <a href="Faraday_isolator" title="wikilink">Faraday isolators</a> and <a href="circulator" title="wikilink">circulators</a>. A current on one side of a Faraday isolator produces a field on the other side but <em>not</em> vice versa.</p>
<h3 id="generalization-to-non-symmetric-materials">Generalization to non-symmetric materials</h3>
<p>For a combination of lossy and magneto-optic materials, and in general when the ε and μ tensors are neither symmetric nor Hermitian matrices, one can still obtain a generalized version of Lorentz reciprocity by considering <span class="LaTeX">$(\mathbf{J}_1, \mathbf{E}_1)$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$(\mathbf{J}_2, \mathbf{E}_2)$</span> to exist in <em>different systems.</em></p>
<p>In particular, if <span class="LaTeX">$(\mathbf{J}_1, \mathbf{E}_1)$</span> satisfy Maxwell's equations at ω for a system with materials <span class="LaTeX">$(\varepsilon_1, \mu_1)$</span>, and <span class="LaTeX">$(\mathbf{J}_2, \mathbf{E}_2)$</span> satisfy Maxwell's equations at ω for a system with materials <span class="LaTeX">$(\varepsilon_1^T, \mu_1^T)$</span>, where <em>T</em> denotes the <a class="uri" href="transpose" title="wikilink">transpose</a>, then the equation of Lorentz reciprocity holds. This can be further generalized to <a href="bi-anisotropic_material" title="wikilink">bi-anisotropic materials</a> by transposing the full 6×6 susceptibility tensor.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="exceptions-to-reciprocity">Exceptions to reciprocity</h3>
<p>For <a href="nonlinear_optics" title="wikilink">nonlinear media</a>, no reciprocity theorem generally holds. Reciprocity also does not generally apply for time-varying ("active") media; for example, when ε is modulated in time by some external process. (In both of these cases, the frequency ω is not generally a conserved quantity.)</p>
<h2 id="feld-tai-reciprocity">Feld-Tai reciprocity</h2>
<p>A closely related reciprocity theorem was articulated independently by Y. A. Feld and C. T. Tai in 1992 and is known as <strong>Feld-Tai reciprocity</strong> or the <strong>Feld-Tai lemma</strong>. It relates two time-harmonic localized current sources and the resulting <a href="magnetic_field" title="wikilink">magnetic fields</a>:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int \mathbf{J}_1 \cdot \mathbf{H}_2 \, dV = \int \mathbf{H}_1 \cdot \mathbf{J}_2 \, dV.$$</span></p>
<p>However, the Feld-Tai lemma is only valid under much more restrictive conditions than Lorentz reciprocity. It generally requires time-invariant linear media with an isotropic homogeneous <a href="Electrical_impedance" title="wikilink">impedance</a>, i.e. a constant <a href="scalar_(physics)" title="wikilink">scalar</a> μ/ε ratio, with the possible exception of regions of perfectly conducting material.</p>
<p>More precisely, Feld-Tai reciprocity requires the Hermitian (or rather, complex-symmetric) symmetry of the electromagnetic operators as above, but also relies on the assumption that the operator relating <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{E}$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$i\omega\mathbf{J}$</span> is a constant scalar multiple of the operator relating <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{H}$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\nabla\times(\mathbf{J}/\varepsilon)$</span>, which is true when ε is a constant scalar multiple of μ (the two operators generally differ by an interchange of ε and μ). As above, one can also construct a more general formulation for integrals over a finite volume.</p>
<h2 id="optical-reciprocity-in-radiometric-terms">Optical reciprocity in radiometric terms</h2>
<p>Apart from quantal effects, classical theory covers near-, middle-, and far-field electric and magnetic phenomena with arbitrary time courses. Optics refers to far-field nearly-sinusoidal oscillatory electromagnetic effects. Instead of paired electric and magnetic variables, optics, including optical reciprocity, can be expressed in <a href="Polarization_(waves)" title="wikilink">polarization</a>-paired radiometric variables, such as <a href="spectral_radiance" title="wikilink">spectral radiance</a>, traditionally called <a href="Specific_radiative_intensity" title="wikilink">specific intensity</a>.</p>
<p>In 1856, <a href="Hermann_von_Helmholtz" title="wikilink">Hermann von Helmholtz</a> wrote:</p>

<p>Like the principles of thermodynamics, this principle is reliable enough to use as a check on the correct performance of experiments, in contrast with the usual situation in which the experiments are tests of a proposed law.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The most extremely simple statement of the principle is 'if I can see you, then you can see me'.</p>

<h2 id="greens-reciprocity">Green's reciprocity</h2>
<p>Whereas the above reciprocity theorems were for oscillating fields, <strong>Green's reciprocity</strong> is an analogous theorem for electrostatics with a fixed distribution of <a href="electric_charge" title="wikilink">electric charge</a> (Panofsky and Phillips, 1962).</p>
<p>In particular, let <span class="LaTeX">$\phi_1$</span> denote the electric potential resulting from a total charge density <span class="LaTeX">$\rho_1$</span>. The electric potential satisfies <a href="Poisson's_equation" title="wikilink">Poisson's equation</a>, <span class="LaTeX">$-\nabla^2 \phi_1 = \rho_1 / \varepsilon_0$</span>, where <span class="LaTeX">$\varepsilon_0$</span> is the <a href="vacuum_permittivity" title="wikilink">vacuum permittivity</a>. Similarly, let <span class="LaTeX">$\phi_2$</span> denote the electric potential resulting from a total charge density <span class="LaTeX">$\rho_2$</span>, satisfying <span class="LaTeX">$-\nabla^2 \phi_2 = \rho_2 / \varepsilon_0$</span>. In both cases, we assume that the charge distributions are localized, so that the potentials can be chosen to go to zero at infinity. Then, Green's reciprocity theorem states that, for integrals over all space:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int \rho_1 \phi_2 dV = \int \rho_2 \phi_1 dV.$$</span></p>
<p>This theorem is easily proven from <a href="Green's_second_identity" title="wikilink">Green's second identity</a>. Equivalently, it is the statement that <span class="LaTeX">$\int \phi_2 ( \nabla^2 \phi_1 ) dV = \int \phi_1 ( \nabla^2 \phi_2 ) dV$</span>, i.e. that <span class="LaTeX">$\nabla^2$</span> is a Hermitian operator (as follows by integrating by parts twice).</p>
