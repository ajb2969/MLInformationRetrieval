<h1>Young's interference experiment</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Young's interference experiment</strong>, also called <strong>Young's double-slit interferometer</strong>, was the original version of the modern <a href="double-slit_experiment" title="wikilink">double-slit experiment</a>, performed at the beginning of the nineteenth century by <a href="Thomas_Young_(scientist)" title="wikilink">Thomas Young</a>. This experiment played a major role in the general acceptance of the <a href="wave_theory_of_light" title="wikilink">wave theory of light</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In Young's own judgment, this was the most important of his many achievements.</p>
<h2 id="theories-of-light-propagation-in-the-17th-and-18th-centuries">Theories of light propagation in the 17th and 18th centuries</h2>

<p>During this period, many scientists proposed a wave theory of light based on experimental observations, including <a href="Robert_Hooke" title="wikilink">Robert Hooke</a>, <a href="Christiaan_Huygens" title="wikilink">Christiaan Huygens</a> and <a href="Leonhard_Euler" title="wikilink">Leonhard Euler</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, <a href="Isaac_Newton" title="wikilink">Isaac Newton</a>, who did many experimental investigations of light, had rejected the wave theory of light and developed his corpuscular (or particle) theory according to which light is emitted from a luminous body in the form of tiny particles. This theory held sway until the beginning of the nineteenth century despite the fact that many phenomena, including <a class="uri" href="diffraction" title="wikilink">diffraction</a> effects at edges or in narrow apertures, colours in thin films and insect wings, and the apparent failure of light particles to crash into one another when two light beams crossed, could not be adequately explained by the corpuscular theory which, nonetheless, had many eminent supporters, including <a href="Pierre-Simon_Laplace" title="wikilink">Pierre-Simon Laplace</a> and <a href="Jean-Baptiste_Biot" title="wikilink">Jean-Baptiste Biot</a>.</p>
<h2 id="youngs-work-on-wave-theory">Young's work on wave theory</h2>

<p>While studying medicine at Göttingen in the 1790s, Young wrote a thesis on the physical and mathematical properties of sound<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and in 1800, he presented a paper to the <a href="Royal_Society" title="wikilink">Royal Society</a> (written in 1799) where he argued that light was also a wave motion. His idea was greeted with a certain amount of skepticism because it contradicted Newton's corpuscular theory.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, he continued to develop his ideas. He believed that a wave model could much better explain many aspects of light propagation than the corpuscular model:</p>

<p>He demonstrated the phenomenon of interference in water waves.</p>

<p>In 1801, he presented a famous paper to the Royal Society entitled "On the Theory of Light and Colours"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> which described various interference phenomena, and in 1803 he performed his famous double-slit experiment (strictly speaking, a double hole experiment).</p>

<p>The figure shows the geometry for a <a class="uri" href="far-field" title="wikilink">far-field</a> viewing plane. It is seen that the relative paths of the light travelling from the two points sources to a given point in the viewing plane varies with the angle θ, so that their relative phases also vary. When the path difference is equal to an integral number of wavelengths, the two waves add together to give a maximum in the brightness, whereas when the path difference is equal to half a wavelength, or one and a half etc., then the two waves cancel, and the intensity is at a minimum. The angular spacing of the fringes, <mtpl></mtpl>, is then given by</p>

<p>In 1817, the corpuscular theorists at the <a href="French_Academy_of_Sciences" title="wikilink">French Academy of Sciences</a> which included <a href="Siméon_Denis_Poisson" title="wikilink">Siméon Denis Poisson</a> were so confident that they set the subject for the next year's prize as diffraction, being certain that a particle theorist would win it.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> <a href="Augustin-Jean_Fresnel" title="wikilink">Augustin-Jean Fresnel</a> submitted a thesis based on wave theory and whose substance consisted of a synthesis of the <a href="Huygens–Fresnel_principle" title="wikilink">Huygens' principle</a> and Young's principle of <a href="interference_(optics)" title="wikilink">interference</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Poisson studied Fresnel's theory in detail and of course looked for a way to prove it wrong being a supporter of the particle-theory of light. Poisson thought that he had found a flaw when he argued that a consequence of Fresnel’s theory was that there would exist an on-axis bright spot in the shadow of a circular obstacle blocking a <a href="point_source" title="wikilink">point source</a> of light, where there should be complete darkness according to the particle-theory of light. Fresnel's theory could not be true, Poisson declared: surely this result was absurd. (The Poisson spot is not easily observed in every-day situations, because most everyday sources of light are not good point sources.)</p>

<p>However, the head of the committee, <a href="François_Arago" title="wikilink">Dominique-François-Jean Arago</a> thought it was necessary to perform the experiment in more detail. He molded a 2-mm metallic disk to a glass plate with wax.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> To everyone's surprise he succeeded in observing the predicted spot, which convinced most scientists of the wave-nature of light. In the end Fresnel won the competition.</p>

<p>After that, the corpuscular theory of light was vanquished, not to be heard of again till the 20th century. Arago later noted that the phenomenon (which was later to be known as the <a href="Arago_spot" title="wikilink">Arago spot</a>) had already been observed by <a href="Joseph-Nicolas_Delisle" title="wikilink">Joseph-Nicolas Delisle</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and <a href="Giacomo_F._Maraldi" title="wikilink">Giacomo F. Maraldi</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> a century earlier.</p>
