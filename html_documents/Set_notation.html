<h1>Set notation</h1>
<hr/>
<p><a href="Set_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">Sets</a> are fundamental objects in <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>. Intuitively, a set is merely a collection of <a href="element_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">elements</a> or <em>members</em>. There are various conventions for textually denoting sets. In any particular situation, an author typically chooses from among these conventions depending on which properties of the set are most relevant to the immediate context or on which perspective is most useful.</p>
<h2 id="denoting-a-set-as-an-object">Denoting a set as an object</h2>
<p>Where it is desirable to refer to a set as an indivisible entity, one typically denotes it by a single capital letter. In referring to an arbitrary, generic set, a typical notational choice is <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span>. When several sets are being discussed simultaneously, they are often denoted by the first few capitals: <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$C$</span>, and so forth. By convention, particular symbols are reserved for the most important sets of numbers:</p>
<dl>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ ∅ } $</span> – <a href="empty_set" title="wikilink">empty set</a> (also <span class="LaTeX">$\emptyset$</span> or <span class="LaTeX">$\varnothing$</span> or <span class="LaTeX">$$</span> are common)
</dd>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ Z } $</span> – <a href="integer" title="wikilink">integers</a> (from <em>Zahl</em>, German for <em><a class="uri" href="integer" title="wikilink">integer</a></em>).
</dd>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ N } $</span> – <a href="natural_number" title="wikilink">natural numbers</a>
</dd>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ Q } $</span> – <a href="rational_number" title="wikilink">rational numbers</a> (from <em><a class="uri" href="quotient" title="wikilink">quotient</a></em>)
</dd>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ R } $</span> – <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real numbers</a>
</dd>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ C } $</span> – <a href="complex_number" title="wikilink">complex numbers</a>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Some authors use the <a href="blackboard_bold" title="wikilink">blackboard bold</a> font for these particular sets (<span class="LaTeX">$\mathbb{C}$</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbb{N}$</span>, etc.). This usage is widely accepted in handwriting, but many mathematicians, and such experts on mathematical typography as <a href="Donald_Knuth" title="wikilink">Donald Knuth</a>, advise against its use in print.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="focusing-on-the-membership-of-a-set">Focusing on the membership of a set</h2>
<p>In many contexts one is interested more in the elements that constitute the set than in the single entity comprising those elements, for instance where stating an <a href="extensional_definition" title="wikilink">extensional definition</a> of the set. Here the elements, whether expressed discretely or in some aggregate manner, are enclosed in braces.</p>
<p>The simplest notational approach of this type, which is feasible only for fairly small sets, is to enumerate the elements exhaustively. Thus the set of suits in a standard deck of playing cards is denoted by {♠, <span style="color:red">♦</span>, <span style="color:red">♥</span>, ♣} and the set of even <a href="prime_numbers" title="wikilink">prime numbers</a> is denoted by <span class="LaTeX">$2 2$</span>. This approach also provides the notation <span class="LaTeX">$$</span> for the empty set.</p>
<p>The <a class="uri" href="semantics" title="wikilink">semantics</a> of the term <em>set</em> imposes certain <a class="uri" href="syntactic" title="wikilink">syntactic</a> constraints on these notations. The only information that is fundamental for a set is which particular objects are, or are not, elements. As a result, the order in which elements appear in an enumeration is irrelevant: <span class="LaTeX">$π π , 6, 1/2$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$1/2, π , 6$</span> are two enumerations of a single set. Likewise, repeated mention of an element is also irrelevant, so <span class="LaTeX">$1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3 3 = 1, 2, 3 3$</span> To deal with collections for which members' multiplicity <em>is</em> significant, there is a generalization of sets called <em><a href="multiset" title="wikilink">multisets</a></em>.</p>
<p>A variant of this explicitly exhaustive enumeration uses ranges of elements and features the <a class="uri" href="ellipsis" title="wikilink">ellipsis</a>. Thus the set of the first ten natural numbers is <span class="LaTeX">$1, 2, 3, ..., 10 0$</span>. Here, of course, the ellipsis means "and so forth." Note that wherever an ellipsis is used to denote a range, it is punctuated as though it were an element of the set. If either extreme of a range is indeterminate, it may be denoted by a <a href="mathematical_expression" title="wikilink">mathematical expression</a> giving a formula to compute it. As an example, if <span class="LaTeX">$n$</span> is known from context to be a positive integer, then the set of the first <span class="LaTeX">$n$</span> <a href="square_number" title="wikilink">perfect squares</a> may be denoted by <mtpl>}</mtpl>.</p>
<p>Some <a href="infinite_set" title="wikilink">infinite sets</a>, too, can be represented in this way. An example is denoting the set of natural numbers (for which one notation described above is <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ N } $</span>) by <span class="LaTeX">$1, 2, 3, ... .$</span>. In cases where the infinitely repeating pattern is not obvious, one can insert an expression to represent a generic element of the set, as with <span class="LaTeX">$0, 1, 3, ..., k ( k -1)/2, ...$</span>.</p>
<p>A more powerful mechanism for denoting a set in terms of its elements is <a href="set-builder_notation" title="wikilink">set-builder notation</a>. Here the general pattern is <span class="LaTeX">$x x : P ( x )$</span>, which denotes the set of all elements <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> (from some <a href="universal_set" title="wikilink">universal set</a>) for which the assertion <span class="LaTeX">$P ( x )$</span> about <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> is true. For example, when understood as a set of points, the circle with radius <span class="LaTeX">$r$</span> and center <span class="LaTeX">$( a , b )$</span>, may be denoted as <mtpl> <em>r</em><sup>2</sup>}}}</mtpl>.</p>
<p>A notable exception to the braces notation is used to express <a href="interval_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">intervals</a> on the <a href="real_line" title="wikilink">real line</a>. Any such interval is well defined only because the real numbers are <a href="Total_order" title="wikilink">totally ordered</a>. It is completely determined by its left and right endpoints: the <a href="unit_interval" title="wikilink">unit interval</a>, for instance, is the set of reals between 0 and 1 (inclusive). The convention for denoting intervals uses brackets and parentheses, depending as the corresponding endpoint is included in or excluded from the set, respectively. Thus the set of reals with <a href="absolute_value" title="wikilink">absolute value</a> less than one is denoted by <span class="LaTeX">$(−1, 1)$</span> — note that this is very different from the <a href="ordered_pair" title="wikilink">ordered pair</a> with first entry −1 and second entry 1. As other examples, the set of reals <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> that satisfy <span class="LaTeX">$2  is denoted by <span class="LaTeX">$(2, 5$</span>, and the set of nonnegative reals is denoted by <span class="LaTeX">$0, ∞) )$</span>.</span></p>
<h2 id="metaphor-in-denoting-sets">Metaphor in denoting sets</h2>
<p>Since so much of mathematics consists in discovering and exploiting patterns, it is perhaps not surprising that there should have arisen various set-denotational conventions that strike practitioners as obvious or natural—if sometimes only once the pattern has been pointed out.</p>
<p>One class comprises those notations deriving the symbol for a set from the algebraic form of a representative element of the set. As an example, consider the set of even numbers. Since a number <span class="LaTeX">$b$</span> is even precisely if there exists some integer <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span> such that <span class="LaTeX">$b = 2 a$</span>, the following <a href="Set-builder_notation#Terms_more_complicated_than_a_single_variable" title="wikilink">variation on set-builder notation</a> could be used to denote this set: <span class="LaTeX">$2 2 a : a ∈ \mathbf{ Z } $</span> (compare this with the formal set-builder notation: <span class="LaTeX">$b b ∈ \mathbf{ Z } : ∃ a ∈ \mathbf{ Z } : b = 2 a$</span>). Alternatively, a single symbol for the set of even numbers is <span class="LaTeX">$2 \mathbf{ Z } $</span>. Likewise, since any odd number must have the form <span class="LaTeX">$2 a + 1$</span> for some integer <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span>, the set of odd numbers may be denoted <span class="LaTeX">$2 \mathbf{ Z } +1$</span>.</p>
<p>A second class is based on a strong logical relationship between a set and a particular integer. One example is the bracket notation, in which the set <span class="LaTeX">$1, ..., n$</span> of the first <span class="LaTeX">$n$</span> positive integers is denoted by <span class="LaTeX">$n n$</span> (as a related point, when endowed with the standard less-than-or-equal <a href="Relation_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">relation</a> <span class="LaTeX">$≤$</span>, the set <span class="LaTeX">$n n$</span> yields the <a class="uri" href="poset" title="wikilink">poset</a> denoted by <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ n } $</span>.) Another example arises from <a href="modular_arithmetic" title="wikilink">modular arithmetic</a>, where <a href="equivalence_classes" title="wikilink">equivalence classes</a> are denoted by <span class="LaTeX">$\bar{a}_n$</span>, which may be understood to represent the set of integers that leave remainder <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span> on division by <span class="LaTeX">$n$</span>. Thus yet another notation for the set of even numbers is <span class="LaTeX">$\bar{0}_2$</span>.</p>
<p>Another set-denotational convention that relies on metaphor comes from <a href="enumerative_combinatorics" title="wikilink">enumerative combinatorics</a>. It derives a symbol for a set <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span> from an expression for the set's <a class="uri" href="cardinality" title="wikilink">cardinality</a>, or size, <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span>. Perhaps the simplest and best known example is the <a href="Cartesian_product" title="wikilink">Cartesian product</a> of sets <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span>, which is the set <span class="LaTeX">$( ( a , b ) : a ∈ A , b ∈ B$</span>. Since in this set every element of <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> gets paired exactly once with every element of <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span>, its cardinality is <span class="LaTeX">$A × B$</span>. For this reason, the set is denoted by <span class="LaTeX">$A × B$</span>. In fact, that same fact about its cardinality is why this set is called a <em>product</em>.</p>
<p>There are many other examples of this convention. One is the set of <a href="Function_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">functions</a> from set <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> to set <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span>. When <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span> are <a href="Finite_set" title="wikilink">finite</a>, specifying any such function amounts to choosing for each element of <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> which element of <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span> should be its <a href="image_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">image</a>, so the number of these functions is <mtpl></mtpl>. Thus one denotes the set of all functions from <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> to <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span> as <mtpl></mtpl>. Another example is the <a href="power_set" title="wikilink">power set</a> of a set <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span>, which, having cardinality <mtpl></mtpl>, is denoted by <mtpl></mtpl>. Note, though, that since any <a class="uri" href="subset" title="wikilink">subset</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span> may be seen as a function assigning to each element of <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span> one or the other element of {include, exclude}, the notation <mtpl></mtpl> may be seen as a special case of <mtpl></mtpl>. The cardinality metaphor has also been used to derive from the standard notation for <a href="binomial_coefficients" title="wikilink">binomial coefficients</a> the notation <span class="LaTeX">$\tbinom X k$</span> for the set of all <span class="LaTeX">$k$</span>-element subsets of a set <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span>.</p>
<p>An example where this cardinality-based convention appears not to have been used yet is <span class="LaTeX">$X !$</span> to denote the set of all <a class="uri" href="permutations" title="wikilink">permutations</a> of a set <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span>. Since it is usually seen as the underlying set of a <a href="symmetric_group" title="wikilink">symmetric group</a>, this set is typically denoted by a symbol for the group itself, either <mtpl></mtpl> or <span class="LaTeX">$Sym( X )$</span>.</p>
<h2 id="other-conventions">Other conventions</h2>
<p>Further conventions are also sometimes seen, including one based on relations. For a relation <span class="LaTeX">$R$</span> on a set <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span>, one may denote the set of objects related by <em>R</em> to some element <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> of <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span> by <mtpl></mtpl>. So from the notation | for the <em>divides</em> relation of <a href="number_theory" title="wikilink">number theory</a>, one may denote the set of factors of an integer <span class="LaTeX">$n$</span> by <mtpl></mtpl>. Similarly, a subset of <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span> is a <em>principal</em> <a href="lower_set" title="wikilink">lower set</a> of a poset <span class="LaTeX">$( X , ≤)$</span> precisely if it can be denoted by <mtpl></mtpl> for some <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span>. And since <span class="LaTeX">$~$</span> is the symbol for the <a href="adjacency_relation" title="wikilink">adjacency relation</a>, the subset of a collection <span class="LaTeX">$W$</span> of vertices of a <a href="graph_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">graph</a> that includes exactly those adjacent to a vertex <span class="LaTeX">$v$</span> (namely, the <a href="intersection_(set_theory)" title="wikilink">intersection</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$W$</span> with the <a href="neighbourhood_(graph_theory)" title="wikilink">open neighborhood</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$v )$</span> may be denoted by <mtpl></mtpl>.</p>
