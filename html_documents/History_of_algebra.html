<h1>History of algebra</h1>
<hr/>

<p>As a branch of <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, <strong><a class="uri" href="algebra" title="wikilink">algebra</a></strong> emerged at the end of 16th century in Europe, with the work of <a href="François_Viète" title="wikilink">François Viète</a>. Algebra can essentially be considered as doing computations similar to those of <a class="uri" href="arithmetic" title="wikilink">arithmetic</a> but with non-numerical mathematical objects. However, until the 19th century, algebra consisted essentially of the <a href="theory_of_equations" title="wikilink">theory of equations</a>. For example, the <a href="fundamental_theorem_of_algebra" title="wikilink">fundamental theorem of algebra</a> belongs to the theory of equations and is not, nowadays, considered as belonging to algebra.</p>

<p>This article describes the history of the theory of equations, called here "algebra", from the origins to the emergence of algebra as a separate area of mathematics. </p>
<h2 id="etymology">Etymology</h2>

<p>The word "algebra" is derived from the <a href="Arabic_language" title="wikilink">Arabic</a> word <em>Al-Jabr</em>, and this comes from the treatise written in 820 by the medieval Persian mathematician, , entitled, in Arabic <em><a href="The_Compendious_Book_on_Calculation_by_Completion_and_Balancing" title="wikilink">Kitāb al-muḫtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-ğabr wa-l-muqābala</a></em>, which can be translated as <em>The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing</em>. The treatise provided for the systematic solution of <a href="linear_equation" title="wikilink">linear</a> and <a href="quadratic_equation" title="wikilink">quadratic equations</a>. Although the exact meaning of the word <em>al-jabr</em> is still unknown, most historians agree that the word meant something like "restoration", "completion",  "It is not certain just what the terms <em>al-jabr</em> and <em>muqabalah</em> mean, but the usual interpretation is similar to that implied in the translation above. The word <em>al-jabr</em> presumably meant something like "restoration" or "completion" and seems to refer to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, which is evident in the treatise; the word <em>muqabalah</em> is said to refer to "reduction" or "balancing"—that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation." "reuniter of broken bones" or "bonesetter". The term is used by al-Khwarizmi to describe the operations that he introduced, "<a href="Reduction_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">reduction</a>" and "balancing", referring to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation.</p>
<h2 id="stages-of-algebra">Stages of algebra</h2>
<h3 id="algebraic-expression">Algebraic expression</h3>

<p>Algebra did not always make use of the symbolism that is now ubiquitous in mathematics, rather, it went through three distinct stages. The stages in the development of symbolic algebra are roughly as follows:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rhetorical algebra</strong>, where equations are written in full sentences. For example, the rhetorical form of x + 1 = 2 is "The thing plus one equals two" or possibly "The thing plus 1 equals 2". Rhetorical algebra was first developed by the ancient <a class="uri" href="Babylonians" title="wikilink">Babylonians</a> and remained dominant up to the 16th century.</li>
<li><strong>Syncopated algebra</strong>, where some symbolism is used but which does not contain all of the characteristic of symbolic algebra. For instance, there may be a restriction that subtraction may be used only once within one side of an equation, which is not the case with symbolic algebra. Syncopated algebraic expression first appeared in <a class="uri" href="Diophantus" title="wikilink">Diophantus</a>' <em><a class="uri" href="Arithmetica" title="wikilink">Arithmetica</a></em>, followed by <a class="uri" href="Brahmagupta" title="wikilink">Brahmagupta</a>'s <em><a href="Brahma_Sphuta_Siddhanta" title="wikilink">Brahma Sphuta Siddhanta</a></em>.</li>
<li><strong>Symbolic algebra</strong>, where full symbolism is used. Early steps toward this can be seen in the work of several <a href="Islamic_mathematics" title="wikilink">Islamic mathematicians</a> such as <a href="Ibn_al-Banna_al-Marrakushi" title="wikilink">Ibn al-Banna</a> and <a href="Abū_al-Hasan_ibn_Alī_al-Qalasādī" title="wikilink">al-Qalasadi</a>, though fully symbolic algebra has been developed by <a href="François_Viète" title="wikilink">François Viète</a>. Later, <a href="René_Descartes" title="wikilink">René Descartes</a> has introduced the modern notation, and shown that the problems occurring in geometry may be expressed and (hopefully) solved in terms of algebra (<a href="Cartesian_geometry" title="wikilink">Cartesian geometry</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>As important as the symbolism, or lack thereof, that was used in algebra was the degree of the equations that were used. <a href="Quadratic_equations" title="wikilink">Quadratic equations</a> played an important role in early algebra; and throughout most of history, until the early modern period, all quadratic equations were classified as belonging to one of three categories.</p>

<p>In between the rhetorical and syncopated stages of symbolic algebra, a <strong>geometric constructive algebra</strong> was developed by classical <a href="Greek_mathematics" title="wikilink">Greek</a> and <a href="Indian_mathematics" title="wikilink">Vedic Indian mathematicians</a> in which algebraic equations were solved through geometry. For instance, an equation of the form

<h3 id="conceptual-stages">Conceptual stages</h3>

<p>In addition to the three stages of expressing algebraic ideas, there were four conceptual stages in the development of algebra that occurred alongside the changes in expression. These four stages were as follows:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geometric stage</strong>, where the concepts of algebra are largely <a href="Geometry" title="wikilink">geometric</a>. This dates back to the <a href="Babylonian_mathematics" title="wikilink">Babylonians</a> and continued with the <a href="Greek_mathematics" title="wikilink">Greeks</a>, and was later revived by <a href="Omar_Khayyám" title="wikilink">Omar Khayyám</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Static equation-solving stage</strong>, where the objective is to find numbers satisfying certain relationships. The move away from geometric algebra dates back to <a class="uri" href="Diophantus" title="wikilink">Diophantus</a> and <a class="uri" href="Brahmagupta" title="wikilink">Brahmagupta</a>, but algebra didn't decisively move to the static equation-solving stage until <a href="Muhammad_ibn_Mūsā_al-Khwārizmī" title="wikilink">Al-Khwarizmi</a>'s <em><a href="The_Compendious_Book_on_Calculation_by_Completion_and_Balancing" title="wikilink">Al-Jabr</a></em>.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic function stage</strong>, where motion is an underlying idea. The idea of a <a href="Function_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">function</a> began emerging with <a href="Sharaf_al-Dīn_al-Tūsī" title="wikilink">Sharaf al-Dīn al-Tūsī</a>, but algebra did not decisively move to the dynamic function stage until <a href="Gottfried_Leibniz" title="wikilink">Gottfried Leibniz</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Abstract stage</strong>, where mathematical structure plays a central role. <a href="Abstract_algebra" title="wikilink">Abstract algebra</a> is largely a product of the 19th and 20th centuries.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="babylonian-algebra">Babylonian algebra</h2>

<p> The origins of algebra can be traced to the ancient <a href="Babylonian_mathematics" title="wikilink">Babylonians</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> who developed a positional number system that greatly aided them in solving their rhetorical algebraic equations. The Babylonians were not interested in exact solutions but approximations, and so they would commonly use <a href="linear_interpolation" title="wikilink">linear interpolation</a> to approximate intermediate values.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> One of the most famous tablets is the <a href="Plimpton_322" title="wikilink">Plimpton 322 tablet</a>, created around 1900–1600 BCE, which gives a table of <a href="Pythagorean_triples" title="wikilink">Pythagorean triples</a> and represents some of the most advanced mathematics prior to Greek mathematics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Babylonian algebra was much more advanced than the Egyptian algebra of the time; whereas the Egyptians were mainly concerned with linear equations the Babylonians were more concerned with quadratic and cubic equations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The Babylonians had developed flexible algebraic operations with which they were able to add equals to equals and multiply both sides of an equation by like quantities so as to eliminate fractions and factors.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> They were familiar with many simple forms of factoring,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> three-term quadratic equations with positive roots,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and many cubic equations<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> although it is not known if they were able to reduce the general cubic equation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>An example of geometric algebra would be solving the linear equation ax = bc. The ancient Greeks would solve this equation by looking at it as an equality of areas rather than as an equality between the ratios a:b and c:x. The Greeks would construct a rectangle with sides of length b and c, then extend a side of the rectangle to length a, and finally they would complete the extended rectangle so as to find the side of the rectangle that is the solution.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p> <a class="uri" href="Euclid" title="wikilink">Euclid</a> (<a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek</a>: ) was a <a href="Greeks" title="wikilink">Greek</a> mathematician who flourished in <a class="uri" href="Alexandria" title="wikilink">Alexandria</a>, <a class="uri" href="Egypt" title="wikilink">Egypt</a>, almost certainly during the reign of <a href="Ptolemy_I" title="wikilink">Ptolemy I</a> (<a href="323_BC" title="wikilink">323</a>–<a href="283_BC" title="wikilink">283 BCE</a>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Neither the year nor place of his birth<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> have been established, nor the circumstances of his death.</p>

<p>Euclid is regarded as the "father of <a class="uri" href="geometry" title="wikilink">geometry</a>". His <em><a href="Euclid's_Elements" title="wikilink">Elements</a></em> is the most successful <a class="uri" href="textbook" title="wikilink">textbook</a> in the <a href="history_of_mathematics" title="wikilink">history of mathematics</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Although he is one of the most famous mathematicians in history there are no new discoveries attributed to him, rather he is remembered for his great explanatory skills.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The <em>Elements</em> is not, as is sometimes thought, a collection of all Greek mathematical knowledge to its date, rather, it is an elementary introduction to it.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="elements"><em>Elements</em></h4>

<p>The geometric work of the Greeks, typified in <a href="Euclid" title="wikilink">Euclid's</a> <em>Elements</em>, provided the framework for generalizing formulae beyond the solution of particular problems into more general systems of stating and solving equations.</p>

<p>Book II of the <em>Elements</em> contains fourteen propositions, which in Euclid's time were extremely significant for doing geometric algebra. These propositions and their results are the geometric equivalents of our modern symbolic algebra and trigonometry.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Today, using modern symbolic algebra, we let symbols represent known and unknown magnitudes (i.e. numbers) and then apply algebraic operations on them. While in Euclid's time magnitudes were viewed as line segments and then results were deduced using the axioms or theorems of geometry.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p>Many basic laws of addition and multiplication are included or proved geometrically in the <em>Elements</em>. For instance, proposition 1 of Book II states:</p>
<dl>
<dd>If there be two straight lines, and one of them be cut into any number of segments whatever, the rectangle contained by the two straight lines is equal to the rectangles contained by the uncut straight line and each of the segments.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>But this is nothing more than the geometric version of the (left) distributive law,

<h3 id="conic-sections">Conic sections</h3>

<p>A <a href="conic_section" title="wikilink">conic section</a> is a curve that results from the intersection of a cone with a plane. There are three primary types of conic sections: <a href="ellipse" title="wikilink">ellipses</a> (including <a class="uri" href="circles" title="wikilink">circles</a>), <a class="uri" href="parabolas" title="wikilink">parabolas</a>, and <a class="uri" href="hyperbolas" title="wikilink">hyperbolas</a>. The conic sections are reputed to have been discovered by <a class="uri" href="Menaechmus" title="wikilink">Menaechmus</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> (c. 380 BCE – c. 320 BCE) and since dealing with conic sections is equivalent to dealing with their respective equations, they played geometric roles equivalent to cubic equations and other higher order equations.</p>

<p>Menaechmus knew that in a parabola, the equation y<sup>2</sup> = <em>l</em>x holds, where <em>l</em> is a constant called the <a href="latus_rectum" title="wikilink">latus rectum</a>, although he was not aware of the fact that any equation in two unknowns determines a curve.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> He apparently derived these properties of conic sections and others as well. Using this information it was now possible to find a solution to the problem of the <a href="duplication_of_the_cube" title="wikilink">duplication of the cube</a> by solving for the points at which two parabolas intersect, a solution equivalent to solving a cubic equation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>We are informed by <a class="uri" href="Eutocius" title="wikilink">Eutocius</a> that the method he used to solve the cubic equation was due to <a class="uri" href="Dionysodorus" title="wikilink">Dionysodorus</a> (250 BCE – 190 BCE). Dionysodorus solved the cubic by means of the intersection of a rectangular <a class="uri" href="hyperbola" title="wikilink">hyperbola</a> and a <a class="uri" href="parabola" title="wikilink">parabola</a>. This was related to a problem in <a class="uri" href="Archimedes" title="wikilink">Archimedes</a>' <em>On the Sphere and Cylinder</em>. Conic sections would be studied and used for thousands of years by Greek, and later Islamic and European, mathematicians. In particular <a href="Apollonius_of_Perga" title="wikilink">Apollonius of Perga</a>'s famous <em><a href="Apollonius_of_Perga#Conics" title="wikilink">Conics</a></em> deals with conic sections, among other topics.</p>

<h3 id="sea-mirror-of-the-circle-measurements"><em>Sea-Mirror of the Circle Measurements</em></h3>

<p><em>Ts'e-yuan hai-ching</em>, or <em>Sea-Mirror of the Circle Measurements</em>, is a collection of some 170 problems written by <a href="Li_Zhi_(mathematician)" title="wikilink">Li Zhi</a> (or Li Ye) (1192 – 1272 CE). He used <em>fan fa</em>, or Horner's method, to solve equations of degree as high as six, although he did not describe his method of solving equations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="mathematical-treatise-in-nine-sections"><em>Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections</em></h3>

<p><em>Shu-shu chiu-chang</em>, or <em><a href="Mathematical_Treatise_in_Nine_Sections" title="wikilink">Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections</a></em>, was written by the wealthy governor and minister <a href="Ch'in_Chiu-shao" title="wikilink">Ch'in Chiu-shao</a> (c. 1202 – c. 1261 CE) and with the invention of a method of solving simultaneous congruences, now called <a href="Chinese_remainder_theorem" title="wikilink">Chinese remainder theorem</a>, it marks the high point in Chinese indeterminate analysis.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="magic-squares">Magic squares</h3>

<p> The earliest known magic squares appeared in China.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> In <em>Nine Chapters</em> the author solves a system of simultaneous linear equations by placing the coefficients and constant terms of the linear equations into a magic square (i.e. a matrix) and performing column reducing operations on the magic square.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The earliest known magic squares of order greater than three are attributed to <a href="Yang_Hui" title="wikilink">Yang Hui</a> (fl. c. 1261 – 1275), who worked with magic squares of order as high as ten.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="precious-mirror-of-the-four-elements"><em>Precious Mirror of the Four Elements</em></h3>

<p><em>Ssy-yüan yü-chien</em>《四元玉鑒》, or <em>Precious Mirror of the Four Elements</em>, was written by <a href="Chu_Shih-chieh" title="wikilink">Chu Shih-chieh</a> in 1303 and it marks the peak in the development of Chinese algebra. The <a href="Classical_element" title="wikilink">four elements</a>, called heaven, earth, man and matter, represented the four unknown quantities in his algebraic equations. The <em>Ssy-yüan yü-chien</em> deals with simultaneous equations and with equations of degrees as high as fourteen. The author uses the method of <em>fan fa</em>, today called <a href="Horner_scheme" title="wikilink">Horner's method</a>, to solve these equations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<p>The <em>Precious Mirror</em> opens with a diagram of the arithmetic triangle (<a href="Pascal's_triangle" title="wikilink">Pascal's triangle</a>) using a round zero symbol, but Chu Shih-chieh denies credit for it. A similar triangle appears in Yang Hui's work, but without the zero symbol.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p>There are many summation series equations given without proof in the <em>Precious mirror</em>. A few of the summation series are:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="diophantine-algebra">Diophantine algebra</h2>

<p> <a class="uri" href="Diophantus" title="wikilink">Diophantus</a> was a <a href="Hellenistic_civilization" title="wikilink">Hellenistic</a> mathematician who lived c. 250 CE, but the uncertainty of this date is so great that it may be off by more than a century. He is known for having written <em>Arithmetica</em>, a treatise that was originally thirteen books but of which only the first six have survived.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> <em>Arithmetica</em> has very little in common with traditional Greek mathematics since it is divorced from geometric methods, and it is different from Babylonian mathematics in that Diophantus is concerned primarily with exact solutions, both determinate and indeterminate, instead of simple approximations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>

<p>In <em>Arithmetica</em>, Diophantus is the first to use symbols for unknown numbers as well as abbreviations for powers of numbers, relationships, and operations;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> thus he used what is now known as <em>syncopated</em> algebra. The main difference between Diophantine syncopated algebra and modern algebraic notation is that the former lacked special symbols for operations, relations, and exponentials.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> So, for example, what we would write as</p>

<p>The Indian mathematicians were active in studying about number systems. Not much verifiable account remains of their contribution to algebra. However, The earliest known <a href="Indian_mathematics" title="wikilink">Indian mathematical</a> documents are dated to around the middle of the first millennium BCE (around the 6th century BCE).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>

<p>The recurring themes in Indian mathematics are, among others, determinate and indeterminate linear and quadratic equations, simple mensuration, and Pythagorean triples.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

, but this is a modified form of an old Babylonian rule that Brahmagupta may have been familiar with.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> He was the first to give a general solution to the linear Diophantine equation ax + by = c, where a, b, and c are integers. Unlike Diophantus who only gave one solution to an indeterminate equation, Brahmagupta gave <em>all</em> integer solutions; but that Brahmagupta used some of the same examples as Diophantus has led some historians to consider the possibility of a Greek influence on Brahmagupta's work, or at least a common Babylonian source.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>

<p>Like the algebra of Diophantus, the algebra of Brahmagupta was syncopated. Addition was indicated by placing the numbers side by side, subtraction by placing a dot over the subtrahend, and division by placing the divisor below the dividend, similar to our notation but without the bar. Multiplication, evolution, and unknown quantities were represented by abbreviations of appropriate terms.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> The extent of Greek influence on this syncopation, if any, is not known and it is possible that both Greek and Indian syncopation may be derived from a common Babylonian source.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>

<p>The first century of the <a href="Islam" title="wikilink">Islamic</a> <a href="Caliphate" title="wikilink">Arab Empire</a> saw almost no scientific or mathematical achievements since the Arabs, with their newly conquered empire, had not yet gained any intellectual drive and research in other parts of the world had faded. In the second half of the 8th century, Islam had a cultural awakening, and research in mathematics and the sciences increased.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn78" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> The Muslim <a class="uri" href="Abbasid" title="wikilink">Abbasid</a> <a class="uri" href="caliph" title="wikilink">caliph</a> <a class="uri" href="al-Mamun" title="wikilink">al-Mamun</a> (809–833) is said to have had a dream where Aristotle appeared to him, and as a consequence al-Mamun ordered that Arabic translation be made of as many Greek works as possible, including Ptolemy's <em>Almagest</em> and Euclid's <em>Elements</em>. Greek works would be given to the Muslims by the <a href="Byzantine_Empire" title="wikilink">Byzantine Empire</a> in exchange for treaties, as the two empires held an uneasy peace.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn79" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Many of these Greek works were translated by <a href="Thabit_ibn_Qurra" title="wikilink">Thabit ibn Qurra</a> (826–901), who translated books written by Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius, Ptolemy, and Eutocius.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn80" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>

<p>There are three theories about the origins of Arabic Algebra. The first emphasizes Hindu influence, the second emphasizes Mesopotamian or Persian-Syriac influence and the third emphasizes Greek influence. Many scholars believe that it is the result of a combination of all three sources.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn81" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>

<p>Throughout their time in power, before the fall of Islamic civilization, the Arabs used a fully rhetorical algebra, where often even the numbers were spelled out in words. The Arabs would eventually replace spelled out numbers (e.g. twenty-two) with <a href="Arabic_numerals" title="wikilink">Arabic numerals</a> (e.g. 22), but the Arabs did not adopt or develop a syncopated or symbolic algebra<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn82" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> until the work of <a href="Ibn_al-Banna" title="wikilink">Ibn al-Banna</a> in the 13th century and <a href="Abū_al-Hasan_ibn_Alī_al-Qalasādī" title="wikilink">Abū al-Hasan ibn Alī al-Qalasādī</a> in the 15th century.</p>

Al-Khwarizmi, who died around 850 CE, wrote more than half a dozen mathematical and astronomical works; some of which were based on the Indian <em>Sindhind</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn84" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> One of al-Khwarizmi's most famous books is entitled <em>Al-jabr wa'l muqabalah</em> or <em><a href="The_Compendious_Book_on_Calculation_by_Completion_and_Balancing" title="wikilink">The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing</a></em>, and it gives an exhaustive account of solving polynomials up to the second degree.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn85" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> The book also introduced the fundamental concept of "<a href="Reduction_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">reduction</a>" and "balancing", referring to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation. This is the operation which Al-Khwarizmi originally described as <em>al-jabr</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn86" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>

<p>R. Rashed and Angela Armstrong write:</p>

<p><em>Al-Jabr</em> is divided into six chapters, each of which deals with a different type of formula. The first chapter of <em>Al-Jabr</em> deals with equations whose squares equal its roots (ax<sup>2</sup> = bx), the second chapter deals with squares equal to number (ax<sup>2</sup> = c), the third chapter deals with roots equal to a number (bx = c), the fourth chapter deals with squares and roots equal a number (ax<sup>2</sup> + bx = c), the fifth chapter deals with squares and number equal roots (ax<sup>2</sup> + c = bx), and the sixth and final chapter deals with roots and number equal to squares (bx + c = ax<sup>2</sup>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn87" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>

Although there was some work being done at <a class="uri" href="Athens" title="wikilink">Athens</a>, it came to a close when in 529 the <a class="uri" href="Byzantine" title="wikilink">Byzantine</a> emperor <a class="uri" href="Justinian" title="wikilink">Justinian</a> closed the <a class="uri" href="pagan" title="wikilink">pagan</a> philosophical schools.

In the 13th century, the solution of a cubic equation by <a class="uri" href="Fibonacci" title="wikilink">Fibonacci</a> is representative of the beginning of a revival in European algebra.</p>

<p>As the Islamic world was declining after the 15th century, the European world was ascending. And it is here that Algebra was further developed.</p>
<h2 id="modern-algebra">Modern algebra</h2>

<p>Another key event in the further development of algebra was the general algebraic solution of the cubic and quartic equations, developed in the mid-16th century. The idea of a <a class="uri" href="determinant" title="wikilink">determinant</a> was developed by <a href="Japanese_mathematics" title="wikilink">Japanese mathematician</a> <a href="Kowa_Seki" title="wikilink">Kowa Seki</a> in the 17th century, followed by <a href="Gottfried_Leibniz" title="wikilink">Gottfried Leibniz</a> ten years later, for the purpose of solving systems of simultaneous linear equations using <a href="matrix_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">matrices</a>. <a href="Gabriel_Cramer" title="wikilink">Gabriel Cramer</a> also did some work on matrices and determinants in the 18th century.</p>

<h3 id="gottfried-leibniz">Gottfried Leibniz</h3>

<p>Although the mathematical notion of <a href="Function_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">function</a> was implicit in trigonometric and logarithmic tables, which existed in his day, <a href="Gottfried_Leibniz" title="wikilink">Gottfried Leibniz</a> was the first, in 1692 and 1694, to employ it explicitly, to denote any of several geometric concepts derived from a curve, such as <a class="uri" href="abscissa" title="wikilink">abscissa</a>, <a class="uri" href="ordinate" title="wikilink">ordinate</a>, <a class="uri" href="tangent" title="wikilink">tangent</a>, <a href="chord_(geometry)" title="wikilink">chord</a>, and the <a href="Normal_(geometry)" title="wikilink">perpendicular</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn127" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> In the 18th century, "function" lost these geometrical associations.</p>

<p>Leibniz realized that the coefficients of a system of <a href="linear_equation" title="wikilink">linear equations</a> could be arranged into an array, now called a <a href="Matrix_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">matrix</a>, which can be manipulated to find the solution of the system, if any. This method was later called <a href="Gaussian_elimination" title="wikilink">Gaussian elimination</a>.

<h3 id="abstract-algebra">Abstract algebra</h3>

<p>The ability to do algebra is a skill cultivated in <a href="mathematics_education" title="wikilink">mathematics education</a>. As explained by Andrew Warwick, <a href="Cambridge_University" title="wikilink">Cambridge University</a> students in the early 19th century practiced "mixed mathematics",<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn128" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> doing <a href="exercise_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">exercises</a> based on physical variables such as space, time, and weight. Over time the association of <a href="variable_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">variables</a> with physical quantities faded away as mathematical technique grew. Eventually mathematics was concerned completely with abstract <a href="polynomial" title="wikilink">polynomials</a>, <a href="complex_number" title="wikilink">complex numbers</a>, <a href="hypercomplex_number" title="wikilink">hypercomplex numbers</a> and other concepts. Application to physical situations was then called <a href="applied_mathematics" title="wikilink">applied mathematics</a> or <a href="mathematical_physics" title="wikilink">mathematical physics</a>, and the field of mathematics expanded to include <a href="abstract_algebra" title="wikilink">abstract algebra</a>.

, where a and b and c are known and x is unknown. The unknown is referred to as "aha," or heap. [...] The solution given by Ahmes is not that of modern textbooks, but one proposed characteristic of a procedure now known as the "method of false position," or the "rule of false." A specific false value has been proposed by 1920s scholars and the operations indicated on the left hand side of the equality sign are performed on this assumed number. Recent scholarship shows that scribes had not guessed in these situations. Exact rational number answers written in Egyptian fraction series had confused the 1920s scholars. The attested result shows that Ahmes "checked" result by showing that 16 + 1/2 + 1/8 exactly added to a seventh of this (which is 2 + 1/4 + 1/8), does obtain 19. Here we see another significant step in the development of mathematics, for the check is a simple instance of a proof."<a href="#fnref16">↩</a></li>

<li id="fn21"> "Whether deduction came into mathematics in the sixth century BCE or the fourth and whether incommensurability was discovered before or after 400 BCE, there can be no doubt that Greek mathematics had undergone drastic changes by the time of Plato. [...] A "geometric algebra" had to take the place of the older "arithmetic algebra," and in this new algebra there could be no adding of lines to areas or of areas to volumes. From now on there had to be strict homogeneity of terms in equations, and the Mesopotamian normal form, xy = A, x ± y = b, were to be interpreted geometrically. [...] In this way the Greeks built up the solution of quadratic equations by their process known as "the application of areas," a portion of geometric algebra that is fully covered by Euclid's <em>Elements</em>. [...] The linear equation ax = bc, for example, was looked upon as an equality of the areas ax and bc, rather than as a proportion—an equality between the two ratios a:b and c:x. Consequently, in constructing the fourth proportion <em>x</em> in this case, it was usual to construct a rectangle OCDB with the sides b = OB and c = OC (Fig 5.9) and then along OC to lay off OA = a. One completes the rectangle OCDB and draws the diagonal OE cutting CD in P. It is now clear that CP is the desired line x, for rectangle OARS is equal in area to rectangle OCDB"<a href="#fnref21">↩</a></li>

<li id="fn34"> "Book II of the <em>Elements</em> is a short one, containing only fourteen propositions, not one of which plays any role in modern textbooks; yet in Euclid's day this book was of great significance. This sharp discrepancy between ancient and modern views is easily explained—today we have symbolic algebra and trigonometry that have replaced the geometric equivalents from Greece. For instance, Proposition 1 of Book II states that "If there be two straight lines, and one of them be cut into any number of segments whatever, the rectangle contained by the two straight lines is equal to the rectangles contained by the uncut straight line and each of the segments." This theorem, which asserts (Fig. 7.5) that AD (AP + PR + RB) = AD·AP + AD·PR + AD·RB, is nothing more than a geometric statement of one of the fundamental laws of arithmetic known today as the distributive law: a (b + c + d) = ab + ac + ad. In later books of the <em>Elements</em> (V and VII) we find demonstrations of the commutative and associative laws for multiplication. Whereas in our time magnitudes are represented by letters that are understood to be numbers (either known or unknown) on which we operate with algorithmic rules of algebra, in Euclid's day magnitudes were pictured as line segments satisfying the axions and theorems of geometry. It is sometimes asserted that the Greeks had no algebra, but this is patently false. They had Book II of the <em>Elements</em>, which is geometric algebra and served much the same purpose as does our symbolic algebra. There can be little doubt that modern algebra greatly facilitates the manipulation of relationships among magnitudes. But it is undoubtedly also true that a Greek geometer versed in the fourteen theorems of Euclid's "algebra" was far more adept in applying these theorems to practical mensuration than is an experienced geometer of today. Ancient geometric "algebra" was not an ideal tool, but it was far from ineffective. Euclid's statement (Proposition 4), "If a straight line be cut at random, the square on the while is equal to the squares on the segments and twice the rectangle contained by the segments, is a verbose way of saying that

Proclus, quoting Eratosthenes, refers to "the conic section triads of Menaechmus." Since this quotation comes just after a discussion of "the section of a right-angled cone" and "the section of an acute-angled cone," it is inferred that the conic sections were produced by cutting a cone with a plane perpendicular to one of its elements. Then if the vertex angle of the cone is acute, the resulting section (called<em>oxytome</em>) is an ellipse. If the angle is right, the section (<em>orthotome</em>) is a parabola, and if the angle is obtuse, the section (<em>amblytome</em>) is a hyperbola (see Fig. 5.7)."<a href="#fnref42">↩</a></li>

[...] Menaechmus apparently derived these properties of the conic sections and others as well. Since this material has a string resemblance to the use of coordinates, as illustrated above, it has sometimes been maintains that Menaechmus had analytic geometry. Such a judgment is warranted only in part, for certainly Menaechmus was unaware that any equation in two unknown quantities determines a curve. In fact, the general concept of an equation in unknown quantities was alien to Greek thought. [...] He had hit upon the conics in a successful search for curves with the properties appropriate to the duplication of the cube. In terms of modern notation the solution is easily achieved. By shifting the curring plane (Gig. 6.2), we can find a parabola with any latus rectum. If, then, we wish to duplicate a cube of edge a, we locate on a right-angled cone two parabolas, one with latus rectum <em>a</em> and another with latus rectum 2<em>a</em>.

But whereas Babylonian mathematicians had been concerned primarily with '' approximate'' solutions of <em>determinate</em> equations as far as the third degree, the <em>Arithmetica</em> of Diophantus (such as we have it) is almost entirely devoted to the <em>exact</em> solution of equations, both <em>determinate</em> and <em>indeterminate</em>. [...] Throughout the six surviving books of <em>Arithmetica</em> there is a systematic use of abbreviations for powers of numbers and for relationships and operations. An unknown number is represented by a symbol resembling the Greek letter ζ (perhaps for the last letter of arithmos). [...] It is instead a collection of some 150 problems, all worked out in terms of specific numerical examples, although perhaps generality of method was intended. There is no postulation development, nor is an effort made to find all possible solutions. In the case of quadratic equations with two positive roots, only the larger is give, and negative roots are not recognized. No clear-cut distinction is made between determinate and indeterminate problems, and even for the latter for which the number of solutions generally is unlimited, only a single answer is given.

It is interesting to note also that the algebra of Brahmagupta, like that of Diophantus, was syncopated. Addition was indicated by juxtaposition, subtraction by placing a dot over the subtrahend, and division by placing the divisor below the dividend, as in our fractional notation but without the bar.

This period (from about 650 to 750) had been, in fact, perhaps the nadir in the development of mathematics, for the Arabs had not yet achieved intellectual drive, and concern for learning in other parts of the world had faded. Had it not been for the sudden cultural awakening in Islam during the second half of the eighth century, considerably more of ancient science and mathematics would have been lost. [...] It was during the caliphate of al-Mamun (809–833), however, that the Arabs fully indulged their passion for translation. The caliph is said to have had a dream in which Aristotle appeared, and as a consequence al-Mamun determined to have Arabic versions made of all the Greek works that he could lay his hands on, including Ptolemy's <em>Almagest</em> and a complete version of Euclid's <em>Elements</em>. From the Byzantine Empire, with which the Arabs maintained an uneasy peace, Greek manuscripts were obtained through peace treaties. Al-Mamun established at Baghdad a "House of Wisdom" (Bait al-hikma) comparable to the ancient Museum at Alexandria. Among the faculty members was a mathematician and astronomer, Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi, whose name, like that of Euclid, later was to become a household word in Western Europe. The scholar, who died sometime before 850, wrote more than half a dozen astronomical and mathematical works, of which the earliest were probably based on the <em>Sindhad</em> derived from India."<a href="#fnref78">↩</a></li>

[...] Thabit was the founder of a school of translators, especially from Greek and Syriac, and to him we owe an immense debt for translations into Arabic of works by Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius, Ptolemy, and Eutocius."<a href="#fnref80">↩</a></li>

The surviving chapters on "Logical Necessities" give precisely the same type of geometric demonstration as al-Khwarizmi's <em>Algebra</em> and in one case the same illustrative example x<sup>2</sup> + 21 = 10x. In one respect 'Abd-al-Hamad's exposition is more thorough than that of al-Khwarizmi for he gives geometric figures to prove that if the discriminant is negative, a quadratic equation has no solution. Similarities in the works of the two men and the systematic organization found in them seem to indicate that algebra in their day was not so recent a development as has usually been assumed. When textbooks with a conventional and well-ordered exposition appear simultaneously, a subject is likely to be considerably beyond the formative stage.

[...] His successor al-Karkhi evidently used this translation to become an Arabic disciple of Diophantus—but without Diophantine analysis!

<li id="fn110"> "Omar Khayyam (c. 1050 – 1123), the "tent-maker," wrote an <em>Algebra</em> that went beyond that of al-Khwarizmi to include equations of third degree. Like his Arab predecessors, Omar Khayyam provided for quadratic equations both arithmetic and geometric solutions; for general cubic equations, he believed (mistakenly, as the sixteenth century later showed), arithmetic solutions were impossible; hence he gave only geometric solutions. The scheme of using intersecting conics to solve cubics had been used earlier by Menaechmus, Archimedes, and Alhazan, but Omar Khayyam took the praiseworthy step of generalizing the method to cover all third-degree equations (having positive roots). .. For equations of higher degree than three, Omar Khayyam evidently did not envision similar geometric methods, for space does not contain more than three dimensions, [...] One of the most fruitful contributions of Arabic eclecticism was the tendency to close the gap between numerical and geometric algebra. The decisive step in this direction came much later with Descartes, but Omar Khayyam was moving in this direction when he wrote, "Whoever thinks algebra is a trick in obtaining unknowns has thought it in vain. No attention should be paid to the fact that algebra and geometry are different in appearance. Algebras are geometric facts which are proved.""<a href="#fnref110">↩</a></li>

[...] When in 527 Justinian became emperor in the East, he evidently felt that the pagan learning of the Academy and other philosophical schools at Athens was a threat to orthodox Christianity; hence, in 529 the philosophical schools were closed and the scholars dispersed. Rome at the time was scarcely a very hospitable home for scholars, and Simplicius and some of the other philosophers looked to the East for haven. This they found in Persia, where under King Chosroes they established what might be called the "Athenian Academy in Exile."(Sarton 1952; p. 400)."<a href="#fnref125">↩</a></li>

<li id="fn129"> "Diophantus sometimes is called "the father of algebra," but this title more appropriately belongs to Abu Abdullah bin mirsmi al-Khwarizmi. It is true that in two respects the work of al-Khwarizmi represented a retrogression from that of Diophantus. First, it is on a far more elementary level than that found in the Diophantine problems and, second, the algebra of al-Khwarizmi is thoroughly rhetorical, with none of the syncopation found in the Greek <em>Arithmetica</em> or in Brahmagupta's work. Even numbers were written out in words rather than symbols! It is quite unlikely that al-Khwarizmi knew of the work of Diophantus, but he must have been familiar with at least the astronomical and computational portions of Brahmagupta; yet neither al-Khwarizmi nor other Arabic scholars made use of syncopation or of negative numbers."<a href="#fnref129">↩</a></li>
