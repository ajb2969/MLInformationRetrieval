<p> </p>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="radio" title="wikilink">radio</a>, <strong>multiple-input and multiple-output</strong>, or <strong>MIMO</strong> (pronounced as "my-moh" or "me-moh"), is a method for multiplying the capacity of a radio link using multiple transmit and receive antennas to exploit <a href="multipath_propagation" title="wikilink">multipath propagation</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> MIMO has become an essential element of wireless communication standards including <a href="IEEE_802.11n" title="wikilink">IEEE 802.11n</a> (Wi-Fi), <a href="IEEE_802.11ac" title="wikilink">IEEE 802.11ac</a> (Wi-Fi), <a href="Evolved_HSPA" title="wikilink">HSPA+</a> (3G), <a class="uri" href="WiMAX" title="wikilink">WiMAX</a> (4G), and <a href="LTE_(telecommunication)" title="wikilink">Long Term Evolution</a> (4G). More recently, MIMO has been applied to <a href="power-line_communication" title="wikilink">power-line communication</a> for 3-wire installations as part of ITU <a class="uri" href="G.hn" title="wikilink">G.hn</a> standard and <a class="uri" href="HomePlug" title="wikilink">HomePlug</a> AV2 specification.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>At one time in wireless the term “MIMO” referred to the mainly theoretical use of multiple antennas at both the transmitter and the receiver. In modern usage, “MIMO” specifically refers to a practical technique for sending and receiving more than one data signal on the same radio channel at the same time via multipath propagation. MIMO is fundamentally different from smart antenna techniques developed to enhance the performance of a single data signal, such as <a class="uri" href="beamforming" title="wikilink">beamforming</a> and <a href="antenna_diversity" title="wikilink">diversity</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-mimo">History of MIMO</h2>
<h3 id="early-research">Early research</h3>

<p>MIMO is often traced back to 1970s research papers concerning multi-channel digital transmission systems and interference (crosstalk) between wire pairs in a cable bundle: AR Kaye and DA George (1970),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Branderburg and Wyner (1974),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and W. van Etten (1975, 1976).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Although these are not examples of exploiting multipath propagation to send multiple information streams, some of the mathematical techniques for dealing with mutual interference proved useful to MIMO development. In the mid-1980s Jack Salz at <a href="Bell_Labs" title="wikilink">Bell Laboratories</a> took this research a step further, investigating multi-user systems operating over “mutually cross-coupled linear networks with additive noise sources” such as time-division multiplexing and dually-polarized radio systems.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>Methods were developed to improve the performance of cellular radio networks and enable more aggressive frequency reuse in the early 1990s. <a href="Space-division_multiple_access" title="wikilink">Space-division multiple access</a> (SDMA) uses directional or smart antennas to communicate on the same frequency with users in different locations within range of the same base station. An SDMA system was proposed by Richard Roy and Björn Ottersten, researchers at <a class="uri" href="ArrayComm" title="wikilink">ArrayComm</a>, in 1991. Their US patent (No. 5515378 issued in 1996<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>) describes a method for increasing capacity using "an array of receiving antennas at the base station" with a "plurality of remote users." <a href="Arogyaswami_Paulraj" title="wikilink">Arogyaswami Paulraj</a> and <a href="Thomas_Kailath" title="wikilink">Thomas Kailath</a> proposed an SDMA-based inverse multiplexing technique in 1993. Their US patent (No. 5,345,599 issued in 1994<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>) described a method of broadcasting at high data rates by splitting a high-rate signal "into several low-rate signals" to be transmitted from “spatially separated transmitters” and recovered by the receive antenna array based on differences in “directions-of-arrival.” However, neither patent contemplated the use of co-located antennas at both ends of a radio link in order to exploit multipath propagation.</p>
<h3 id="invention">Invention</h3>

<p>In an April 1996 paper and subsequent patent, <a href="Gregory_Raleigh" title="wikilink">Greg Raleigh</a> proposed that natural multipath propagation can be exploited to transmit multiple, independent information streams using co-located antennas and multi-dimensional signal processing.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The paper also identified practical solutions for modulation (MIMO-OFDM), coding, synchronization, and channel estimation. Later that year (September 1996) <a href="Gerard_J._Foschini" title="wikilink">Gerard J. Foschini</a> submitted a paper that also suggested it is possible to multiply the capacity of a wireless link using what the author described as “layered space-time architecture.”<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>Greg Raleigh, V. K. Jones, and Michael Pollack founded Clarity Wireless in 1996, and built and field-tested a prototype MIMO system.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Cisco Systems acquired Clarity Wireless in 1998.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Bell Labs built a laboratory prototype demonstrating its V-BLAST (Vertical-Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time) technology in 1998.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Arogyaswami Paulraj founded Iospan Wireless in late 1998 to develop MIMO-OFDM products. Iospan was acquired by Intel in 2003.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> V-BLAST was never commercialized, and neither Clarity Wireless nor Iospan Wireless shipped MIMO-OFDM products before being acquired.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>MIMO technology has been standardized for <a href="Wireless_LAN" title="wikilink">wireless LANs</a>, <a class="uri" href="3G" title="wikilink">3G</a> mobile phone networks, and <a class="uri" href="4G" title="wikilink">4G</a> mobile phone networks and is now in widespread commercial use. Greg Raleigh and V. K.

The <a href="Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers" title="wikilink">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</a> (IEEE) created a task group in late 2003 to develop a wireless LAN standard delivering at least 100 Mbit/s of user data throughput. There were two major competing proposals: TGn Sync was backed by companies including Intel and <a class="uri" href="Philips" title="wikilink">Philips</a>, and WWiSE was supported by companies including Airgo Networks, <a class="uri" href="Broadcom" title="wikilink">Broadcom</a>, and <a href="Texas_Instruments" title="wikilink">Texas Instruments</a>.

<h2 id="functions-of-mimo">Functions of MIMO</h2>

<p>MIMO can be sub-divided into three main categories, <a class="uri" href="precoding" title="wikilink">precoding</a>, <a href="spatial_multiplexing" title="wikilink">spatial multiplexing</a> or SM, and <a href="Diversity_Coding" title="wikilink">diversity coding</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a class="uri" href="Precoding" title="wikilink">Precoding</a></strong> is multi-stream <a class="uri" href="beamforming" title="wikilink">beamforming</a>, in the narrowest definition. In more general terms, it is considered to be all spatial processing that occurs at the transmitter. In (single-stream) beamforming, the same signal is emitted from each of the transmit antennas with appropriate phase and gain weighting such that the signal power is maximized at the receiver input. The benefits of beamforming are to increase the received signal gain - by making signals emitted from different antennas add up constructively - and to reduce the multipath fading effect. In <a href="line-of-sight_propagation" title="wikilink">line-of-sight propagation</a>, beamforming results in a well-defined directional pattern. However, conventional beams are not a good analogy in cellular networks, which are mainly characterized by <a href="multipath_propagation" title="wikilink">multipath propagation</a>. When the receiver has multiple antennas, the transmit beamforming cannot simultaneously maximize the signal level at all of the receive antennas, and precoding with multiple streams is often beneficial. Note that precoding requires knowledge of <a href="channel_state_information" title="wikilink">channel state information</a> (CSI) at the transmitter and the receiver.</p>

<p><strong><a href="Spatial_multiplexing" title="wikilink">Spatial multiplexing</a></strong> requires MIMO antenna configuration. In spatial multiplexing, a high-rate signal is split into multiple lower-rate streams and each stream is transmitted from a different transmit antenna in the same frequency channel. If these signals arrive at the receiver antenna array with sufficiently different spatial signatures and the receiver has accurate CSI, it can separate these streams into (almost) parallel channels. Spatial multiplexing is a very powerful technique for increasing channel capacity at higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The maximum number of spatial streams is limited by the lesser of the number of antennas at the transmitter or receiver. Spatial multiplexing can be used without CSI at the transmitter, but can be combined with <a class="uri" href="precoding" title="wikilink">precoding</a> if CSI is available. Spatial multiplexing can also be used for simultaneous transmission to multiple receivers, known as <a href="space-division_multiple_access" title="wikilink">space-division multiple access</a> or <a href="multi-user_MIMO" title="wikilink">multi-user MIMO</a>, in which case CSI is required at the transmitter.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The scheduling of receivers with different spatial signatures allows good separability.</p>

<p><strong><a href="Diversity_coding" title="wikilink">Diversity coding</a></strong> techniques are used when there is no <a href="channel_state_information" title="wikilink">channel knowledge</a> at the transmitter. In diversity methods, a single stream (unlike multiple streams in spatial multiplexing) is transmitted, but the signal is coded using techniques called <a href="space-time_coding" title="wikilink">space-time coding</a>. The signal is emitted from each of the transmit antennas with full or near orthogonal coding. Diversity coding exploits the independent fading in the multiple antenna links to enhance signal diversity. Because there is no channel knowledge, there is no beamforming or <a href="array_gain" title="wikilink">array gain</a> from diversity coding. Diversity coding can be combined with spatial multiplexing when some channel knowledge is available at the transmitter.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="multi-user-types">Multi-user types</h3>

<p>Recently, results of research on multi-user MIMO technology have been emerging. While full multi-user MIMO (or network MIMO) can have a higher potential, practically, the research on (partial) multi-user MIMO (or multi-user and multi-antenna MIMO) technology is more active.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Multi-user_MIMO" title="wikilink">Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO)</a>
<ul>
<li>In recent <a class="uri" href="3GPP" title="wikilink">3GPP</a> and <a class="uri" href="WiMAX" title="wikilink">WiMAX</a> standards, MU-MIMO is being treated as one of the candidate technologies adoptable in the specification by a number of companies, including Samsung, Intel, Qualcomm, Ericsson, TI, Huawei, Philips, Alcatel-Lucent, and Freescale. For these and other firms active in the mobile hardware market, MU-MIMO is more feasible for low-complexity cell phones with a small number of reception antennas, whereas single-user SU-MIMO's higher per-user throughput is better suited to more complex user devices with more antennas.</li>
<li>Per-user unitary and rate control (PU<sup>2</sup>RC) allows the network to allocate each antenna to a different user instead of allocating only a single user as in single-user MIMO scheduling. The network can transmit user data through a codebook-based spatial beam or a virtual antenna. Efficient user scheduling, such as pairing spatially-distinguishable users with codebook-based spatial beams, is additionally discussed for the simplification of wireless networks in terms of additional wireless resource requirements and complex protocol modification. Recently, PU<sup>2</sup>RC is included in the system description documentation (SDD) of IEEE 802.16m (WiMAX evolution to meet the ITU-R's IMT-Advance requirements).</li>
<li>Enhanced multiuser MIMO: 1) Employs advanced decoding techniques, 2) Employs advanced precoding techniques</li>
<li>SDMA represents either <a href="space-division_multiple_access" title="wikilink">space-division multiple access</a> or super-division multiple access where <em>super</em> emphasises that orthogonal division such as frequency and time division is not used but non-orthogonal approaches such as superposition coding are used.</li>

<li>Uses distributed antennas which belong to other users.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a class="uri" href="Macrodiversity" title="wikilink">Macrodiversity</a> MIMO
<ul>
<li>A form of space diversity scheme which uses multiple transmit or receive base stations for communicating coherently with single or multiple users which are possibly distributed in the coverage area, in the same time and frequency resource.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></li>
<li>The transmitters are far apart in contrast to traditional microdiversity MIMO schemes such as single-user MIMO. In a multi-user macrodiversity MIMO scenario, users may also be far apart. Therefore, every constituent link in the virtual MIMO link has distinct average link <a href="Signal-to-noise_ratio" title="wikilink">SNR</a>. This difference is mainly due to the different long-term channel impairments such as path loss and shadow fading which are experienced by different links.</li>
<li>Macrodiversity MIMO schemes pose unprecedented theoretical and practical challenges. Among many theoretical challenges, perhaps the most fundamental challenge is to understand how the different average link SNRs affect the overall system capacity and individual user performance in fading environments.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></li>

MIMO routing is different from conventional (SISO) routing since conventional routing protocols route node-by-node in each hop.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Massive MIMO is a technology where the number of terminals is much less than the number of base station (mobile station) antennas.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> In a rich scattering environment, the full advantages of the massive MIMO system can be exploited using simple beamforming strategies such as maximum ratio transmission (MRT) or zero forcing (ZF). To achieve these benefits of massive MIMO, accurate CSI must be available perfectly. However, in practice, the channel between the transmitter and receiver is estimated from orthogonal pilot sequences which are limited by the coherence time of the channel. Most importantly, in a multicell setup, the reuse of pilot sequences of several co-channel cells will create pilot contamination. When there is pilot contamination, the performance of massive MIMO degrades quite drastically. To alleviate the effect of pilot contamination, the work of<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> proposes a simple pilot assignment and channel estimation method from limited training sequences.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="applications-of-mimo">Applications of MIMO</h2>

<p>Spatial multiplexing techniques make the receivers very complex, and therefore they are typically combined with <a href="Orthogonal_frequency-division_multiplexing" title="wikilink">Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing</a> (OFDM) or with <a href="Orthogonal_Frequency_Division_Multiple_Access" title="wikilink">Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access</a> (OFDMA) modulation, where the problems created by a multi-path channel are handled efficiently. The IEEE <a class="uri" href="802.16e" title="wikilink">802.16e</a> standard incorporates MIMO-OFDMA. The IEEE 802.11n standard, released in October 2009, recommends MIMO-OFDM.</p>

<p>MIMO is also planned to be used in <a href="Mobile_radio_telephone" title="wikilink">Mobile radio telephone</a> standards such as recent <a class="uri" href="3GPP" title="wikilink">3GPP</a> and <a class="uri" href="3GPP2" title="wikilink">3GPP2</a>. In 3GPP, <a href="HSPA+" title="wikilink">High-Speed Packet Access plus (HSPA+)</a> and <a href="3GPP_Long_Term_Evolution" title="wikilink">Long Term Evolution (LTE)</a> standards take MIMO into account. Moreover, to fully support cellular environments, MIMO research consortia including IST-MASCOT propose to develop advanced MIMO techniques, e.g., <a href="Multi-user_MIMO" title="wikilink">multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO)</a>.</p>

<p>MIMO technology can be used in non-wireless communications systems. One example is the home networking standard <a class="uri" href="ITU-T" title="wikilink">ITU-T</a> <a class="uri" href="G.9963" title="wikilink">G.9963</a>, which defines a powerline communications system that uses MIMO techniques to transmit multiple signals over multiple AC wires (phase, neutral and ground).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="mimo-testing">MIMO testing</h2>

<p>MIMO signal testing focuses first on the transmitter/receiver system. The random phases of the sub-carrier signals can produce instantaneous power levels that cause the amplifier to compress, momentarily causing distortion and ultimately symbol errors. Signals with a high <strong>PAR</strong> (<a href="peak-to-average_ratio" title="wikilink">peak-to-average ratio</a>) can cause amplifiers to compress unpredictably during transmission. OFDM signals are very dynamic and compression problems can be hard to detect because of their noise-like nature.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>Knowing the quality of the signal channel is also critical. A <a href="radio_channel_emulator" title="wikilink">channel emulator</a> can simulate how a device performs at the cell edge, can add noise or can simulate what the channel looks like at speed. To fully qualify the performance of a receiver, a calibrated transmitter, such as a <a href="Signal_generator#Vector_signal_generators" title="wikilink">vector signal generator</a> (VSG), and channel emulator can be used to test the receiver under a variety of different conditions. Conversely, the transmitter's performance under a number of different conditions can be verified using a channel emulator and a calibrated receiver, such as a <a href="vector_signal_analyzer" title="wikilink">vector signal analyzer</a> (VSA).</p>

<p>Understanding the channel allows for manipulation of the phase and amplitude of each transmitter in order to form a beam. To correctly form a beam, the transmitter needs to understand the characteristics of the channel. This process is called <em>channel sounding</em> or <a href="channel_estimation" title="wikilink">channel estimation</a>. A known signal is sent to the mobile device that enables it to build a picture of the channel environment. The mobile device sends back the channel characteristics to the transmitter. The transmitter can then apply the correct phase and amplitude adjustments to form a beam directed at the mobile device. This is called a closed-loop MIMO system. For <a class="uri" href="beamforming" title="wikilink">beamforming</a>, it is required to adjust the phases and amplitude of each transmitter. In a beamformer optimized for spatial diversity or spatial multiplexing, each antenna element simultaneously transmits a weighted combination of two data symbols.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<p>Papers by Gerard J. Foschini and Michael J. Gans,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Foschini<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> and Emre Telatar<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> have shown that the <a href="channel_capacity" title="wikilink">channel capacity</a> (a theoretical upper bound on system throughput) for a MIMO system is increased as the number of antennas is increased, proportional to the smaller of the number of transmit antennas and the number of receive antennas. This is known as the multiplexing gain and this basic finding in <a href="information_theory" title="wikilink">information theory</a> is what led to a spurt of research in this area. Despite the simple propagation models used in the aforementioned seminal works, the multiplexing gain is a fundamental property that can be proved under almost any physical channel propagation model and with practical hardware that is prone to transceiver impairments.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>

<p>A textbook by A. Paulraj, R. Nabar and D. Gore has published an introduction to this area.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> There are many other principal textbooks available as well.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Mobile Experts has published a <a href="http://mobile-experts.net/product_info.php?products_id=46">research report</a> which predicts the use of MIMO technology in 500 million PCs, tablets, and smartphones by 2016.</p>
<h3 id="diversity-multiplexing-tradeoff-dmt">Diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT)</h3>

<p>There exists a fundamental tradeoff between transmit diversity and spatial multiplexing gains in a MIMO system (Zheng and Tse, 2003).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> In particular, achieving high spatial multiplexing gains is of profound importance in modern wireless systems.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="other-applications">Other applications</h3>

<p>Given the nature of MIMO, it is not limited to wireless communication. It can be used for <a href="wire_line" title="wikilink">wire line</a> communication as well. For example, a new type of <a class="uri" href="DSL" title="wikilink">DSL</a> technology (gigabit DSL) has been proposed based on binder MIMO channels.</p>
<h3 id="sampling-theory-in-mimo-systems">Sampling theory in MIMO systems</h3>

<p>An important question which attracts the attention of engineers and mathematicians is how to use the multi-output signals at the receiver to recover the multi-input signals at the transmitter. In Shang, Sun and Zhou (2007), sufficient and necessary conditions are established to guarantee the complete recovery of the multi-input signals.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
