<h1>Electronic band structure</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a href="solid-state_physics" title="wikilink">solid-state physics</a>, the <strong>electronic band structure</strong> (or simply <strong>band structure</strong>) of a <a class="uri" href="solid" title="wikilink">solid</a> describes those ranges of <a class="uri" href="energy" title="wikilink">energy</a> that an <a class="uri" href="electron" title="wikilink">electron</a> within the solid may have (called <em>energy bands</em>, <em>allowed bands</em>, or simply <em>bands</em>) and ranges of energy that it may not have (called <em><a href="band_gap" title="wikilink">band gaps</a></em> or <em>forbidden bands</em>). <strong>Band theory</strong> derives these bands and band gaps by examining the allowed quantum mechanical <a href="wave_function" title="wikilink">wave functions</a> for an electron in a large, periodic lattice of atoms or molecules. Band theory has been successfully used to explain many physical properties of solids, such as <a href="electrical_resistivity" title="wikilink">electrical resistivity</a> and <a href="optical_absorption" title="wikilink">optical absorption</a>, and forms the foundation of the understanding of all <a href="Solid-state_(electronics)" title="wikilink">solid-state devices</a> (transistors, solar cells, etc.).</p>
<h2 id="why-bands-and-band-gaps-occur">Why bands and band gaps occur</h2>

<p><a href="File:Metals_and_insulators,_quantum_difference_from_band_structure.ogv" title="wikilink">thumb|upright=1.65|Animation of band formation and how electrons fill them in a metal and an insulator</a></p>

<p>The electrons of a single, isolated atom occupy <a href="atomic_orbital" title="wikilink">atomic orbitals</a>. Each orbital forms at a discrete <a href="energy_level" title="wikilink">energy level</a>. When multiple atoms join together to form into a <a class="uri" href="molecule" title="wikilink">molecule</a>, their atomic orbitals combine to form <a href="molecular_orbital" title="wikilink">molecular orbitals</a>, each of which forms at a discrete energy level. As more atoms are brought together, the molecular orbitals extend larger and larger, and the energy levels of the molecule will become increasingly dense. Eventually, the collection of atoms form a giant molecule, or in other words, a solid. For this giant molecule, the energy levels are so close that they can be considered to form a continuum.</p>

<p><a href="Band_gap" title="wikilink">Band gaps</a> are essentially leftover ranges of energy not covered by any band, a result of the finite widths of the energy bands. The bands have different widths, with the widths depending upon the degree of overlap in the <a href="atomic_orbital" title="wikilink">atomic orbitals</a> from which they arise. Two adjacent bands may simply not be wide enough to fully cover the range of energy. For example, the bands associated with core orbitals (such as <a href="1s_electron" title="wikilink">1s electrons</a>) are extremely narrow due to the small overlap between adjacent atoms. As a result, there tend to be large band gaps between the core bands. Higher bands involve larger and larger orbitals with more overlap, becoming progressively wider and wider at high energy so that there are no band gaps at high energy.</p>
<h2 id="basic-concepts">Basic concepts</h2>
<h3 id="assumptions-and-limits-of-band-structure-theory">Assumptions and limits of band structure theory</h3>

<p>To start out, it is important to note what has been assumed in order to gain the simplicity of the band theory:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Infinite-size system</em>: For the bands to be continuous, we must consider a large piece of material. The concept of band structure can be extended to systems which are only "large" along reduced dimensions, such as <a href="2DEG" title="wikilink">two-dimensional electron systems</a>.</li>
<li><em>Homogeneous system</em>: The notion of a band structure as an intrinsic property of a material assumes that the material is homogeneous in some way. Practically, this means that band structure describes the bulk inside a uniform piece of material.</li>
<li><em>Non-interactivity</em>: The band structure describes "single electron states". The existence of these states assumes that the electrons travel in a static potential without dynamically interacting with <a href="lattice_vibration" title="wikilink">lattice vibrations</a>, other electrons, <a href="photon" title="wikilink">photons</a>, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>The above assumptions are broken in a number of important practical situations, and the use of band structure requires one to keep a close check on the limitations of band theory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inhomogeneities and interfaces: Near surfaces, junctions, and other inhomogeneities, the bulk band structure is disrupted. Not only are there local small-scale disruptions (e.g., <a href="surface_states" title="wikilink">surface states</a> or <a class="uri" href="dopant" title="wikilink">dopant</a> states inside the band gap), but also local charge imbalances. These charge imbalances have electrostatic effects that extend deeply into semiconductors, insulators, and the vacuum (see <a href="doping_(semiconductor)" title="wikilink">doping</a>, <a href="band_bending" title="wikilink">band bending</a>).</li>
<li>Along the same lines, most electronic effects (<a class="uri" href="capacitance" title="wikilink">capacitance</a>, <a href="electrical_conductance" title="wikilink">electrical conductance</a>, <a href="electric-field_screening" title="wikilink">electric-field screening</a>) involve the physics of electrons passing through surfaces and/or near interfaces. The full description of these effects, in a band structure picture, requires at least a rudimentary model of electron-electron interactions (see <a href="space_charge" title="wikilink">space charge</a>, <a href="band_bending" title="wikilink">band bending</a>).</li>
<li>Small systems: For systems which are small along every dimension (e.g., a small <a class="uri" href="molecule" title="wikilink">molecule</a> or a <a href="quantum_dot" title="wikilink">quantum dot</a>), there is no continuous band structure. The crossover between small and large dimensions is the realm of <a href="mesoscopic_physics" title="wikilink">mesoscopic physics</a>.</li>
<li><a href="Strongly_correlated_material" title="wikilink">Strongly correlated materials</a>: Some materials (<a href="superconductor" title="wikilink">superconductors</a>, <a href="Mott_insulator" title="wikilink">Mott insulators</a>, and more) simply cannot be understood in terms of single-electron states. The electronic band structures of these materials are poorly defined (or at least, not uniquely defined) and may not provide useful information about their physics.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="crystalline-symmetry-and-wavevectors">Crystalline symmetry and wavevectors</h3>

<p> </p>

<p>Band structure calculations take advantage of the periodic nature of a crystal lattice, exploiting its symmetry. The single-electron <a href="Schrödinger_equation" title="wikilink">Schrödinger equation</a> is solved for an electron in a lattice-periodic potential, giving <a href="Bloch_wave" title="wikilink">Bloch waves</a> as solutions:</p>

,</p>

<p>where <strong>k</strong> is called the wavevector. For each value of <strong>k</strong>, there are multiple solutions to the Schrödinger equation labelled by <em>n</em>, the band index, which simply numbers the energy bands. Each of these energy levels evolves smoothly with changes in <strong>k</strong>, forming a smooth band of states. For each band we can define a function <em>E</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>(<strong>k</strong>), which is the <a href="dispersion_relation" title="wikilink">dispersion relation</a> for electrons in that band.</p>

<p>The wavevector takes on any value inside the <a href="Brillouin_zone" title="wikilink">Brillouin zone</a>, which is a polyhedron in wavevector space that is related to the crystal's lattice. Wavevectors outside the Brillouin zone simply correspond to states that are physically identical to those states within the Brillouin zone. Special high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone are assigned labels like Γ, Δ, Λ, Σ.</p>

<p>It is difficult to visualize the shape of a band as a function of wavevector, as it would require a plot in four-dimensional space, <em>E</em> vs. <em>k<sub>x</sub></em>, <em>k<sub>y</sub></em>, <em>k<sub>z</sub></em>. In scientific literature it is common to see <strong>band structure plots</strong> which show the values of <em>E</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>(<strong>k</strong>) for values of <strong>k</strong> along straight lines connecting symmetry points. Another method for visualizing band structure is to plot a constant-energy <a class="uri" href="isosurface" title="wikilink">isosurface</a> in wavevector space, showing all of the states with energy equal to a particular value. The isosurface of states with energy equal to the <a href="Fermi_level" title="wikilink">Fermi level</a> is known as the <a href="Fermi_surface" title="wikilink">Fermi surface</a>.</p>

<p>Energy band gaps can be classified using the wavevectors of the states surrounding the band gap:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Direct_band_gap" title="wikilink">Direct band gap</a>: the lowest-energy state above the band gap has the same <strong>k</strong> as the highest-energy state beneath the band gap.</li>
<li><a href="Indirect_band_gap" title="wikilink">Indirect band gap</a>: the closest states above and beneath the band gap do not have the same <strong>k</strong> value.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="asymmetry-band-structures-in-non-crystalline-solids">Asymmetry: Band structures in non-crystalline solids</h4>

<p>Although electronic band structures are usually associated with <a href="crystal" title="wikilink">crystalline</a> materials, <a href="quasi-crystal" title="wikilink">quasi-crystalline</a> and <a href="amorphous_solid" title="wikilink">amorphous solids</a> may also exhibit band structures. These are somewhat more difficult to study theoretically since they lack the simple symmetry of a crystal, and it is not usually possible to determine a precise dispersion relation. As a result, virtually all of the existing theoretical work on the electronic band structure of solids has focused on crystalline materials.</p>
<h3 id="density-of-states">Density of states</h3>

<p>The density of states function <em>g</em>(<em>E</em>) is defined as the number of electronic states per unit volume, per unit energy, for electron energies near <em>E</em>.</p>

<p>The density of states function is important for calculations of effects based on band theory. It appears in calculations for <a href="optical_absorption" title="wikilink">optical absorption</a> where it provides both the number of excitable electrons and the number of final states for an electron. It appears in calculations of <a href="electrical_conductivity" title="wikilink">electrical conductivity</a> where it provides the number of mobile states, and in computing electron scattering rates where it provides the number of final states after scattering.</p>

<p>For energies inside a band gap, <em>g</em>(<em>E</em>) = 0.</p>
<h3 id="filling-of-bands">Filling of bands</h3>

<p>At <a href="thermodynamic_equilibrium" title="wikilink">thermodynamic equilibrium</a>, the likelihood of a state of energy <em>E</em> being filled with an electron is given by the <a href="Fermi–Dirac_distribution" title="wikilink">Fermi–Dirac distribution</a>, a thermodynamic distribution that takes into account the <a href="Pauli_exclusion_principle" title="wikilink">Pauli exclusion principle</a>:</p>

<p>Although there are an infinite number of bands and thus an infinite number of states, there are only a finite number of electrons to place in these bands. The preferred value for the number of electrons is a consequence of electrostatics: even though the surface of a material can be charged, the internal bulk of a material prefers to be charge neutral. The condition of charge neutrality means that <em>N</em>/<em>V</em> must match the density of protons in the material. For this to occur, the material electrostatically adjusts itself, shifting its band structure up or down in energy (thereby shifting <em>g</em>(<em>E</em>)), until it is at the correct equilibrium with respect to the Fermi level.</p>
<h4 id="names-of-bands-near-the-fermi-level-conduction-band-valence-band">Names of bands near the Fermi level (conduction band, valence band)</h4>

<p>A solid has an infinite number of allowed bands, just as an atom has infinitely many energy levels. However, most of the bands simply have too high energy, and are usually disregarded under ordinary circumstances.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Conversely, there are very low energy bands associated with the core orbitals (such as <a href="1s_electron" title="wikilink">1s electrons</a>). These low-energy <em>core band</em>s are also usually disregarded since they remain filled with electrons at all times, and are therefore inert.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Likewise, materials have several band gaps throughout their band structure.</p>

<p>The most important bands and band gaps—those relevant for electronics and optoelectronics—are those with energies near the Fermi level. The bands and band gaps near the Fermi level are given special names, depending on the material:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a <a class="uri" href="semiconductor" title="wikilink">semiconductor</a> or <a href="band_insulator" title="wikilink">band insulator</a>, the Fermi level is surrounded by a band gap, referred to as <em>the</em> band gap (to distinguish it from the other band gaps in the band structure). The closest band above the band gap is called <em>the <a href="conduction_band" title="wikilink">conduction band</a></em>, and the closest band beneath the band gap is called <em>the <a href="valence_band" title="wikilink">valence band</a></em>. The name "valence band" was coined by analogy to chemistry, since in many semiconductors the valence band is built out of the <a href="valence_orbital" title="wikilink">valence orbitals</a>.</li>
<li>In a metal or <a class="uri" href="semimetal" title="wikilink">semimetal</a>, the Fermi level is inside of one or more allowed bands. In semimetals the bands are usually referred to as "conduction band" or "valence band" depending on whether the charge transport is more electron-like or hole-like, by analogy to semiconductors. In many metals, however, the bands are neither electron-like nor hole-like, and often just called "valence band" as they are made of valence orbitals.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The band gaps in a metal's band structure are not important for low energy physics, since they are too far from the Fermi level.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="nearly-free-electron-approximation">Nearly free electron approximation</h3>

<p>In the nearly free electron approximation, interactions between electrons are completely ignored. This approximation allows use of <a href="Bloch's_Theorem" title="wikilink">Bloch's Theorem</a> which states that electrons in a periodic potential have <a href="wavefunction" title="wikilink">wavefunctions</a> and energies which are periodic in wavevector up to a constant phase shift between neighboring <a href="reciprocal_lattice" title="wikilink">reciprocal lattice</a> vectors. The consequences of periodicity are described mathematically by the Bloch wavefunction:</p>

<p>Here index <em>n</em> refers to the <em>n-th</em> energy band, wavevector <strong>k</strong> is related to the direction of motion of the electron, <strong>r</strong> is the position in the crystal, and <strong>R</strong> is the location of an atomic site.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>The NFE model works particularly well in materials like metals where distances between neighbouring atoms are small. In such materials the overlap of <a href="atomic_orbital" title="wikilink">atomic orbitals</a> and potentials on neighbouring <a href="atom" title="wikilink">atoms</a> is relatively large. In that case the <a href="wave_function" title="wikilink">wave function</a> of the electron can be approximated by a (modified) plane wave.

<p>The TB model works well in materials with limited overlap between <a href="atomic_orbital" title="wikilink">atomic orbitals</a> and potentials on neighbouring atoms. Band structures of materials like <a href="Silicon" title="wikilink">Si</a>, <a class="uri" href="GaAs" title="wikilink">GaAs</a>, SiO<sub>2</sub> and <a class="uri" href="diamond" title="wikilink">diamond</a> for instance are well described by TB-Hamiltonians on the basis of atomic sp<sup>3</sup> orbitals. In <a href="transition_metals" title="wikilink">transition metals</a> a mixed TB-NFE model is used to describe the broad NFE <a href="conduction_band" title="wikilink">conduction band</a> and the narrow embedded TB d-bands. The radial functions of the atomic orbital part of the Wannier functions are most easily calculated by the use of <a class="uri" href="pseudopotential" title="wikilink">pseudopotential</a> methods. NFE, TB or combined NFE-TB band structure calculations,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> sometimes extended with wave function approximations based on pseudopotential methods, are often used as an economic starting point for further calculations.</p>
<h3 id="kkr-model">KKR model</h3>

<p>The simplest form of this approximation centers non-overlapping spheres (referred to as <em>muffin tins</em>) on the atomic positions. Within these regions, the potential experienced by an electron is approximated to be spherically symmetric about the given nucleus. In the remaining interstitial region, the <a href="Screening_effect" title="wikilink">screened potential</a> is approximated as a constant. Continuity of the potential between the atom-centered spheres and interstitial region is enforced.</p>

<p>A variational implementation was suggested by Korringa and by <a href="Walter_Kohn" title="wikilink">Kohn</a> and Rostocker, and is often referred to as the <em><a href="Coherent_Potential_Approximation" title="wikilink">KKR model</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="density-functional-theory">Density-functional theory</h3>

<p>In recent physics literature, a large majority of the electronic structures and band plots are calculated using <a href="density-functional_theory" title="wikilink">density-functional theory</a> (DFT), which is not a model but rather a theory, i.e., a microscopic first-principles theory of <a href="condensed_matter_physics" title="wikilink">condensed matter physics</a> that tries to cope with the electron-electron many-body problem via the introduction of an <a class="uri" href="exchange-correlation" title="wikilink">exchange-correlation</a> term in the functional of the <a href="electronic_density" title="wikilink">electronic density</a>. DFT-calculated bands are in many cases found to be in agreement with experimentally measured bands, for example by <a href="angle-resolved_photoemission_spectroscopy" title="wikilink">angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</a> (ARPES). In particular, the band shape is typically well reproduced by DFT. But there are also systematic errors in DFT bands when compared to experiment results. In particular, DFT seems to systematically underestimate by about 30-40% the band gap in insulators and semiconductors.</p>

<p>It is commonly believed that DFT is a theory to predict <a href="ground_state" title="wikilink">ground state</a> properties of a system only (e.g. the <a href="total_energy" title="wikilink">total energy</a>, the <a href="atomic_structure" title="wikilink">atomic structure</a>, etc.), and that <a href="excited_state" title="wikilink">excited state</a> properties cannot be determined by DFT. This is a misconception. In principle, DFT can determine any property (ground state or excited state) of a system given a functional that maps the ground state density to that property. This is the essence of the Hohenburg–Kohn theorem.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In practice, however, no known functional exists that maps the ground state density to excitation energies of electrons within a material. Thus, what in the literature is quoted as a DFT band plot is a representation of the DFT <a href="Kohn–Sham_equations" title="wikilink">Kohn–Sham energies</a>, i.e., the energies of a fictive non-interacting system, the Kohn–Sham system, which has no physical interpretation at all. The Kohn–Sham electronic structure must not be confused with the real, <a class="uri" href="quasiparticle" title="wikilink">quasiparticle</a> electronic structure of a system, and there is no <a href="Koopman's_theorem" title="wikilink">Koopman's theorem</a> holding for Kohn–Sham energies, as there is for Hartree–Fock energies, which can be truly considered as an approximation for <a href="quasiparticle_energies" title="wikilink">quasiparticle energies</a>. Hence, in principle, Kohn–Sham based DFT is not a band theory, i.e., not a theory suitable for calculating bands and band-plots. In principle <a href="Time-dependent_density_functional_theory" title="wikilink">time-dependent DFT</a> can be used to calculate the true band structure although in practice this is often difficult. A popular approach is the use of <a href="hybrid_functional" title="wikilink">hybrid functionals</a>, which incorporate a portion of Hartree–Fock exact exchange; this produces a substantial improvement in predicted bandgaps of semiconductors, but is less reliable for metals and wide-bandgap materials.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="greens-function-methods-and-the-ab-initio-gw-approximation">Green's function methods and the <em>ab initio</em> GW approximation</h3>

<p>To calculate the bands including electron-electron interaction <a href="Many-body_problem" title="wikilink">many-body effects</a>, one can resort to so-called <a href="Green's_function_(many-body_theory)" title="wikilink">Green's function</a> methods. Indeed, knowledge of the Green's function of a system provides both ground (the total energy) and also excited state observables of the system. The <a class="uri" href="poles" title="wikilink">poles</a> of the Green's function are the quasiparticle energies, the bands of a solid. The Green's function can be calculated by solving the <a href="Dyson_equation" title="wikilink">Dyson equation</a> once the <a class="uri" href="self-energy" title="wikilink">self-energy</a> of the system is known. For real systems like solids, the self-energy is a very complex quantity and usually approximations are needed to solve the problem. One such approximation is the <a href="GW_approximation" title="wikilink">GW approximation</a>, so called from the mathematical form the self-energy takes as the product Σ = <em>GW</em> of the Green's function <em>G</em> and the dynamically screened interaction <em>W</em>. This approach is more pertinent when addressing the calculation of band plots (and also quantities beyond, such as the spectral function) and can also be formulated in a completely <em>ab initio</em> way. The GW approximation seems to provide band gaps of insulators and semiconductors in agreement with experiment, and hence to correct the systematic DFT underestimation.</p>
<h3 id="mott-insulators">Mott insulators</h3>

<p>Although the nearly free electron approximation is able to describe many properties of electron band structures, one consequence of this theory is that it predicts the same number of electrons in each unit cell. If the number of electrons is odd, we would then expect that there is an unpaired electron in each unit cell, and thus that the valence band is not fully occupied, making the material a conductor. However, materials such as <a href="Cobalt(II)_oxide" title="wikilink">CoO</a> that have an odd number of electrons per unit cell are insulators, in direct conflict with this result. This kind of material is known as a <a href="Mott_insulator" title="wikilink">Mott insulator</a>, and requires inclusion of detailed electron-electron interactions (treated only as an averaged effect on the crystal potential in band theory) to explain the discrepancy. The <a href="Hubbard_model" title="wikilink">Hubbard model</a> is an approximate theory that can include these interactions. It can be treated non-perturbatively within the so-called <a href="dynamical_mean_field_theory" title="wikilink">dynamical mean field theory</a>, which bridges the gap between the nearly free electron approximation and the atomic limit.</p>
<h3 id="others">Others</h3>

<p>Calculating band structures is an important topic in theoretical <a href="solid_state_physics" title="wikilink">solid state physics</a>. In addition to the models mentioned above, other models include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Empty_lattice_approximation" title="wikilink">Empty lattice approximation</a>: the "band structure" of a region of free space that has been divided into a lattice.</li>
<li><a href="k·p_perturbation_theory" title="wikilink">k·p perturbation theory</a> is a technique that allows a band structure to be approximately described in terms of just a few parameters. The technique is commonly used for <a class="uri" href="semiconductors" title="wikilink">semiconductors</a>, and the parameters in the model are often determined by experiment.</li>
<li>The <a href="Particle_in_a_one-dimensional_lattice_(periodic_potential)#Kronig–Penney_model" title="wikilink">Kronig-Penney Model</a>, a one-dimensional rectangular well model useful for illustration of band formation. While simple, it predicts many important phenomena, but is not quantitative.</li>
<li><a href="Hubbard_model" title="wikilink">Hubbard model</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The band structure has been generalised to wavevectors that are <a href="complex_number" title="wikilink">complex numbers</a>, resulting in what is called a <em>complex band structure</em>, which is of interest at surfaces and interfaces.</p>

<p>Each model describes some types of solids very well, and others poorly. The nearly free electron model works well for metals, but poorly for non-metals. The tight binding model is extremely accurate for ionic insulators, such as <a href="metal_halide" title="wikilink">metal halide</a> salts (e.g. <a href="Sodium_chloride" title="wikilink">NaCl</a>).</p>
<h2 id="band-diagrams">Band Diagrams</h2>

<p>To understand how band structure changes relative to the Fermi level in real space, a band structure plot is often first simplified in the form of a <a href="band_diagram" title="wikilink">band diagram</a>. In a band diagram the vertical axis is energy while the horizontal axis represents real space. Horizontal lines represent energy levels, while blocks represent energy bands. When the horizontal lines in these diagram are slanted then the energy of the level or band changes with distance. Diagrammatically, this depicts the presence of an electric field within the crystal system. Band diagrams are useful in relating the general band structure properties of different materials to one another when placed in contact with each other.</p>
