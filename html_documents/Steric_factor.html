<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is a term used in collision theory.</p>

<p>It is defined as the ratio between the experimental value of the <a href="rate_constant" title="wikilink">rate constant</a> and the one predicted by collision theory. It can also be defined as the ratio between the <a href="preexponential_factor" title="wikilink">preexponential factor</a> and the <a href="collision_frequency" title="wikilink">collision frequency</a>, and it is most often less than unity. Physically, the steric factor can be interpreted as the ratio of the <a href="Cross_section_(physics)" title="wikilink">cross section</a> for reactive collisions to the total collision cross section.</p>

<p>Usually, the more complex the reactant <a href="molecule" title="wikilink">molecules</a>, the lower the steric factors. Nevertheless, some reactions exhibit steric factors greater than unity: the <a href="harpoon_reaction" title="wikilink">harpoon reactions</a>, which involve atoms that exchange electrons, producing ions. The deviation from unity can have different causes: the molecules are not spherical, so different geometries are possible; not all the <a href="kinetic_energy" title="wikilink">kinetic energy</a> is delivered into the right spot; the presence of a <a class="uri" href="solvent" title="wikilink">solvent</a> (when applied to solutions)...</p>

<p>When collision theory applied to reactions in solution the <a href="solvent_cage" title="wikilink">solvent cage</a> has an effect on the reactant molecules, as several collisions can take place in a single encounter, which leads to predicted preexponential factors being too large. ρ values greater than unity can be attributed to favorable entropic contributions.</p>

<p>Usually there is no simple way to accurately estimate steric factors without performing trajectory or scattering calculations.</p>
