<p>In <a href="planetary_astronomy" title="wikilink">planetary astronomy</a> and <a class="uri" href="astrobiology" title="wikilink">astrobiology</a>, the <strong>Rare Earth Hypothesis</strong> argues that the <a href="origin_of_life" title="wikilink">emergence</a> of complex <a href="multicellular_life" title="wikilink">multicellular life</a> on <a class="uri" href="Earth" title="wikilink">Earth</a> (and, subsequently, <a class="uri" href="intelligence" title="wikilink">intelligence</a>) required an improbable combination of <a href="astrophysics" title="wikilink">astrophysical</a> and <a href="geology" title="wikilink">geological</a> events and circumstances. The hypothesis argues that complex <a href="extraterrestrial_life" title="wikilink">extraterrestrial life</a> is a very improbable phenomenon and likely to be extremely rare. The term "Rare Earth" originates from <em>Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe</em> (2000), a book by <a href="Peter_Ward_(paleontologist)" title="wikilink">Peter Ward</a>, a geologist and paleontologist, and <a href="Donald_E._Brownlee" title="wikilink">Donald E. Brownlee</a>, an astronomer and <a href="astrobiology" title="wikilink">astrobiologist</a>, both faculty members at the University of Washington.</p>

<p>An alternative view point was argued by <a href="Carl_Sagan" title="wikilink">Carl Sagan</a> and <a href="Frank_Drake" title="wikilink">Frank Drake</a>, among others. It holds that Earth is a typical rocky <a class="uri" href="planet" title="wikilink">planet</a> in a typical <a href="planetary_system" title="wikilink">planetary system</a>, located in a non-exceptional region of a common <a href="barred-spiral_galaxy" title="wikilink">barred-spiral galaxy</a>. Given the <a href="principle_of_mediocrity" title="wikilink">principle of mediocrity</a> (also called the <a href="Copernican_principle" title="wikilink">Copernican principle</a>), it is probable that the universe teems with complex life. Ward and Brownlee argue to the contrary: that planets, <a href="planetary_systems" title="wikilink">planetary systems</a>, and galactic regions that are as friendly to complex life as are the Earth, the Solar System, and our region of the <a href="Milky_Way" title="wikilink">Milky Way</a> are very rare.</p>
<h2 id="rare-earths-requirements-for-complex-life">Rare Earth's requirements for complex life</h2>

<p>The Rare Earth hypothesis argues that the emergence of complex life requires a host of fortuitous circumstances. A number of such circumstances are set out below under the following headings: a <a href="galactic_habitable_zone" title="wikilink">galactic habitable zone</a>, a central star and planetary system having the requisite character, the <a href="circumstellar_habitable_zone" title="wikilink">circumstellar habitable zone</a>, a right sized terrestrial planet, the advantage of a gas giant guardian and large satellite, conditions needed to ensure the planet has a <a class="uri" href="magnetosphere" title="wikilink">magnetosphere</a> and <a href="plate_tectonics" title="wikilink">plate tectonics</a>, the chemistry of the <a class="uri" href="lithosphere" title="wikilink">lithosphere</a>, <a class="uri" href="atmosphere" title="wikilink">atmosphere</a>, and oceans, the role of "evolutionary pumps" such as massive <a class="uri" href="glaciation" title="wikilink">glaciation</a> and rare <a href="Meteoroid#Bolide" title="wikilink">bolide</a> impacts, and whatever led to the still mysterious <a href="Cambrian_explosion" title="wikilink">Cambrian explosion</a> of animal <a href="phylum" title="wikilink">phyla</a>. The emergence of <a href="Evolution_of_human_intelligence" title="wikilink">intelligent life</a> may have required yet other rare events.</p>

<p>In order for a small rocky planet to support complex life, Ward and Brownlee argue, the values of several variables must fall within narrow ranges. The <a class="uri" href="universe" title="wikilink">universe</a> is so vast that it could contain many Earth-like planets. But if such planets exist, they are likely to be separated from each other by many thousands of <a href="light_year" title="wikilink">light years</a>. Such distances may preclude communication among any intelligent species evolving on such planets, which would solve the <a href="Fermi_paradox" title="wikilink">Fermi paradox</a>: "If extraterrestrial aliens are common, why aren't they obvious?"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-right-location-in-the-right-kind-of-galaxy">The right location in the right kind of galaxy</h3>

<p> <em>Rare Earth</em> suggests that much of the known universe, including large parts of our galaxy, cannot support complex life; Ward and Brownlee refer to such regions as "dead zones". Those parts of a galaxy where complex life is possible make up the <a href="galactic_habitable_zone" title="wikilink">galactic habitable zone</a>. This zone is primarily a function of distance from the galactic center. As that distance increases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Star <a class="uri" href="metallicity" title="wikilink">metallicity</a> declines. Metals (which in astronomy means all elements other than hydrogen and helium) are necessary to the formation of <a href="terrestrial_planets" title="wikilink">terrestrial planets</a>.</li>
<li>The <a class="uri" href="X-ray" title="wikilink">X-ray</a> and <a href="gamma_ray" title="wikilink">gamma ray</a> radiation from the <a href="Supermassive_black_hole" title="wikilink">black hole</a> at the <a href="galactic_center" title="wikilink">galactic center</a>, and from nearby <a href="neutron_star" title="wikilink">neutron stars</a>, becomes less intense. Radiation of this nature is considered dangerous to complex life, hence the Rare Earth hypothesis predicts that the early universe, and galactic regions where stellar density is high and <a href="supernova" title="wikilink">supernovae</a> are common, will be unfit for the development of complex life.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
<li>Gravitational perturbation of planets and <a class="uri" href="planetesimals" title="wikilink">planetesimals</a> by nearby stars becomes less likely as the density of stars decreases. Hence the further a planet lies from the galactic center or a spiral arm, the less likely it is to be struck by a large <a href="Meteoroid#Bolide" title="wikilink">bolide</a>. A sufficiently large impact may <a href="extinction" title="wikilink">extinguish</a> all complex life on a planet.</li>
</ol>

<p>Item #1 rules out the outer reaches of a galaxy; #2 and #3 rule out galactic inner regions, <a href="globular_cluster" title="wikilink">globular clusters</a>, and the <a href="spiral_arm" title="wikilink">spiral arms</a> of <a href="spiral_galaxy" title="wikilink">spiral galaxies</a>. These "arms" are regions of a galaxy characterized by a higher rate of star formation, moving very slowly through the galaxy in a wave-like manner. As one moves from the center of a galaxy to its furthest extremity, the ability to support life rises then falls. Hence the galactic habitable zone may be ring-shaped, sandwiched between its uninhabitable center and outer reaches.</p>

<p>While a planetary system may enjoy a location favorable to complex life, it must also maintain that location for a span of time sufficiently long for complex life to evolve. Hence a central star with a galactic orbit that steers clear of galactic regions where radiation levels are high, such as the galactic center and the spiral arms, would appear most favourable. If the central star's galactic orbit is <a href="orbital_eccentricity" title="wikilink">eccentric</a> (elliptic or hyperbolic), it will pass through some spiral arms, but if the orbit is a near perfect circle and the orbital velocity equals the "rotational" velocity of the spiral arms, the star will drift into a spiral arm region only gradually—if at all. Therefore, <em>Rare Earth</em> proponents conclude that a life-bearing star must have a galactic orbit that is nearly circular about the center of its galaxy. The required synchronization of the orbital velocity of a central star with the wave velocity of the spiral arms can occur only within a fairly narrow range of distances from the galactic center. This region is termed the "galactic habitable zone". Lineweaver et al.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> calculate that the galactic habitable zone is a ring 7 to 9 <a href="parsec" title="wikilink">kiloparsecs</a> in diameter, that includes no more than 10% of the stars in the <a href="Milky_Way" title="wikilink">Milky Way</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Based on conservative estimates of the total number of stars in the galaxy, this could represent something like 20 to 40 billion stars. Gonzalez, <em>et al.</em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> would halve these numbers; he estimates that at most 5% of stars in the Milky Way fall in the galactic habitable zone.</p>

<p>The orbit of the Sun around the center of the Milky Way is indeed almost perfectly circular, with <a href="Galactic_year" title="wikilink">a period of 226 Ma</a> (1 Ma = 1 million years), one closely matching the rotational period of the galaxy. While the Rare Earth hypothesis predicts that the Sun should rarely, if ever, have passed through a spiral arm since its formation, astronomer Karen Masters has calculated that the orbit of the Sun takes it through a major spiral arm approximately every 100 million years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Some researchers have suggested that several mass extinctions do correspond with previous crossings of the spiral arms.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Andromeda_Galaxy" title="wikilink">Andromeda</a> and the Milky Way have a similar mass, but whereas Andromeda is a typical spiral galaxy the Milky Way is unusually quiet and dim. It appears to have suffered fewer collisions with other galaxies over the last 10 billion years, and its peaceful history may have made it more hospitable to complex life than galaxies which have suffered more collisions, and consequently more supernovae and other disturbances.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The level of activity of the <a href="black_hole" title="wikilink">black hole</a> at the centre of the Milky Way may also be important: too much or too little and the conditions for life may be even rarer. The Milky Way black hole appears to be just right.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="orbiting-at-the-right-distance-from-the-right-type-of-star">Orbiting at the right distance from the right type of star</h3>

<p>The terrestrial example suggests that complex life requires water in the liquid state, and a central star's planet must therefore be at an appropriate distance. This is the core of the notion of the <a href="habitable_zone" title="wikilink">habitable zone</a> or <a href="Goldilocks_Principle" title="wikilink">Goldilocks Principle</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The habitable zone forms a ring around the central star. If a planet orbits its sun too closely or too far away, the surface temperature is incompatible with water being in liquid form.</p>

<p>The habitable zone varies with the type and age of the central star. For advanced life the star must have a high degree of stability. The habitable zone for a main sequence star very gradually moves out over time until the star becomes a white dwarf, at which time the habitable zone vanishes. The habitable zone is closely connected to the <a href="greenhouse_warming" title="wikilink">greenhouse warming</a> afforded by atmospheric water vapor (), carbon dioxide (), and/or other greenhouse gases. Even though the <a href="Atmosphere_of_Earth" title="wikilink">Earth's atmosphere</a> contains a water vapor concentration from 0% (in arid regions) to 4% (in rain forest and ocean regions) and -as of June 2013- only 400 parts per million of , these small amounts suffice to raise the average surface temperature of the Earth by about 40 °C from what it would otherwise be,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> with the dominant contribution being due to water vapor, which together with clouds makes up between 66% and 85% of Earth's greenhouse effect, with  contributing between 9% and 26% of the effect.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>Rocky planets must orbit within the habitable zone for life to form. Although the habitable zone of such hot stars as <a class="uri" href="Sirius" title="wikilink">Sirius</a> or <a class="uri" href="Vega" title="wikilink">Vega</a> is wide:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rocky planets that form too close to the star to lie within the habitable zone cannot sustain life; however, life could arise on a <a href="natural_satellite" title="wikilink">moon</a> of a gas giant. Hot stars also emit much more <a href="ultraviolet_radiation" title="wikilink">ultraviolet radiation</a> that <a href="ionize" title="wikilink">ionizes</a> any planetary <a href="Celestial_body_atmosphere" title="wikilink">atmosphere</a>.</li>
<li>Hot stars, as mentioned above, may become <a href="red_giant" title="wikilink">red giants</a> before advanced life <a href="Evolution" title="wikilink">evolves</a> on their planets.</li>
</ol>

<p>These considerations rule out the massive and powerful stars of type F6 to O (see <a href="stellar_classification" title="wikilink">stellar classification</a>) as homes to evolved metazoan life.</p>

<p>Small <a href="red_dwarf" title="wikilink">red dwarf</a> stars conversely have small <a href="habitable_zone" title="wikilink">habitable zones</a> wherein planets are in <a href="tidal_lock" title="wikilink">tidal lock</a>—one side always faces the star and becomes very hot and the other always faces away and becomes very cold—and are also at increased risk of solar flares (see <a href="Aurelia_and_Blue_Moon#Aurelia" title="wikilink">Aurelia</a>) that would tend to ionize the atmosphere and be otherwise inimical to complex life. <em>Rare Earth</em> proponents argue that life therefore cannot arise in such systems and that only central stars that range from F7 to K1 stars are hospitable. Such stars are rare: G type stars such as the Sun (between the hotter F and cooler K) comprise only 9%<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> of the hydrogen-burning stars in the Milky Way. However, <a href="Planetary_habitability#Red_dwarf_systems" title="wikilink">some exobiologists have suggested</a> that stars outside this range may give rise to life under the right circumstances; this possibility is a central point of contention to the theory because these late-K and M category stars make up about 82% of all hydrogen-burning stars.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>  Such aged stars as <a href="red_giant" title="wikilink">red giants</a> and <a href="white_dwarf" title="wikilink">white dwarfs</a> are also unlikely to support life. Red giants are common in globular clusters and <a href="elliptical_galaxy" title="wikilink">elliptical galaxies</a>. White dwarfs are mostly dying stars that have already completed their red giant phase. Stars that become red giants expand into or overheat the habitable zones of their youth and middle age (though theoretically planets at a much greater distance <a href="Red_giant#Prospects_for_habitability" title="wikilink">may become habitable</a>).</p>

<p>An energy output that varies with the lifetime of the star will very likely prevent life (e.g., as <a href="Cepheid_variable" title="wikilink">Cepheid variables</a>). A sudden decrease, even if brief, may freeze the water of orbiting planets, and a significant increase may evaporate them and cause a <a href="greenhouse_effect" title="wikilink">greenhouse effect</a> that may prevent the oceans from reforming.</p>

<p>Life without complex chemistry is unknown. Such chemistry requires <a href="metallicity" title="wikilink">metals</a>, namely elements other than hydrogen or helium and thereby suggests that a planetary system rich in <a href="metallicity" title="wikilink">metals</a> is a necessity for life. The only known mechanism for creating and dispersing metals is a <a class="uri" href="supernova" title="wikilink">supernova</a> explosion. The <a href="absorption_spectrum" title="wikilink">absorption spectrum</a> of a star reveals the presence of metals within, and studies of stellar spectra reveal that many, perhaps most, stars are poor in metals. Low metallicity characterizes the early universe: globular clusters and other stars that formed when the universe was young, stars in most galaxies other than large <a href="spiral_galaxy" title="wikilink">spirals</a>, and stars in the outer regions of all galaxies. Metal-rich central stars capable of supporting complex life are therefore believed to be most common in the quiet suburbs of the larger spiral galaxies—where radiation also happens to be weak.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="with-the-right-arrangement-of-planets">With the right arrangement of planets</h3>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>According to Rare Earth, without the presence of the massive gas giant Jupiter (fifth <a class="uri" href="planet" title="wikilink">planet</a> from the <a class="uri" href="Sun" title="wikilink">Sun</a> and the <a href="Solar_system_by_size" title="wikilink">largest</a>) complex life on Earth would not have arisen.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Rare Earth proponents argue that a planetary system capable of sustaining complex life must be structured more or less like the Solar System, with small and rocky inner planets and outer gas giants.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>In addition, the arrangement of the Solar System is not only rare but optimal as the large mass and gravitational attraction of the gas giants provide protection for the inner rocky planets from <a href="Small_Solar_System_body" title="wikilink">Small Solar System body</a> impacts and <a class="uri" href="asteroid" title="wikilink">asteroid</a> bombardment.</p>
<h3 id="a-continuously-stable-orbit">A continuously stable orbit</h3>

<p>Rare Earth argues that a gas giant must not be too close to a body upon which life is developing, unless that body is one of its moons. Close placement of gas giant(s) could disrupt the <a class="uri" href="orbit" title="wikilink">orbit</a> of a potential life-bearing planet, either directly or by drifting into the habitable zone.</p>

<p>Newtonian dynamics can produce <a href="n-body_problem#Three-body_problem" title="wikilink">chaotic planetary orbits</a>, especially in a system having <a href="Jovian_planets" title="wikilink">large planets</a> at high <a href="orbital_eccentricity" title="wikilink">orbital eccentricity</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>The need for stable orbits rules out <a href="Extrasolar_planet" title="wikilink">stars with systems of planets</a> that contain large planets with orbits close to the host star (called "<a href="hot_Jupiters" title="wikilink">hot Jupiters</a>"). It is believed that hot Jupiters formed much further from their parent stars than they are now, and have migrated inwards to their current orbits. In the process, they would have catastrophically disrupted the orbits of any planets in the habitable zone.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="a-terrestrial-planet-of-the-right-size">A terrestrial planet of the right size</h3>

<p>It is argued that life requires terrestrial planets like Earth and as gas giants lack such a surface, that complex life cannot arise there.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>A planet that is too small cannot hold much of an atmosphere. Hence the surface temperature becomes more variable and the average temperature drops. Substantial and long-lasting oceans become impossible. A small planet will also tend to have a rough surface, with large mountains and deep canyons. The core will cool faster, and <a href="plate_tectonics" title="wikilink">plate tectonics</a> will either not last as long as they would on a larger planet or may not occur at all. A planet that is too large will retain too much of its atmosphere and will be like Venus. Venus is similar in size and mass to Earth, but has a surface atmosphere pressure that is 92 times that of Earth's. Venus mean surface temperature is 735 K (462 °C; 863 °F) making Venus the hottest planet in the Solar System. Earth had a similar early atmosphere to Venus, but lost it in the giant impact event.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="with-plate-tectonics">With plate tectonics</h3>

<p>Rare Earth proponents argue that <a href="plate_tectonics" title="wikilink">plate tectonics</a> and a large <a href="Earth's_magnetic_field" title="wikilink">magnetic field</a> are essential for the emergence and sustenance of complex life.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Ward &amp; Brownlee assert that biodiversity, global temperature regulation, carbon cycle and the magnetic field of the Earth that make it habitable for complex terrestrial life all depend on plate tectonics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p>Ward &amp; Brownlee contend that the lack of mountain chains elsewhere in the Solar System is direct evidence that Earth is the only body with plate tectonics and as such the only body capable of supporting life.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>Plate tectonics is dependent on chemical composition and a long-lasting source of heat in the form of <a href="radioactive_decay" title="wikilink">radioactive decay</a> occurring deep in the planet's interior. Continents must also be made up of less dense <a class="uri" href="felsic" title="wikilink">felsic</a> rocks that "float" on underlying denser <a class="uri" href="mafic" title="wikilink">mafic</a> rock. Taylor<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> emphasizes that <a class="uri" href="subduction" title="wikilink">subduction</a> zones (an essential part of plate tectonics) require the lubricating action of ample water; on Earth, such zones exist only at the bottom of oceans.</p>

<p>Ward &amp; Brownlee and others such as Tilman Spohn of the German Space Research Centre Institute of Planetary Research<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> argue that plate tectonics provides a means of <a href="Biogeochemical_cycle" title="wikilink">biochemical cycling</a> which promotes complex life on Earth and that water is required to lubricate planetary plates.</p>

<p>Plate tectonics and as a result <a href="continental_drift" title="wikilink">continental drift</a> and the creation of separate land masses would create diversified ecosystems which is thought to have promoted the diversification of species, and that diversity is one of the strongest defenses against extinction.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>An example of species diversification and later competition on Earth's continents is the <a href="Great_American_Interchange" title="wikilink">Great American Interchange</a>. This was the result of the <a href="tectonism" title="wikilink">tectonically</a> induced connection between North &amp; Middle America with the <a href="South_America" title="wikilink">South American</a> continent, at around 3.5 to 3 Ma. The previously undisturbed <a class="uri" href="fauna" title="wikilink">fauna</a> of South America could evolve in their own way for about 30 million years, since <a class="uri" href="Antarctica" title="wikilink">Antarctica</a> separated. Many species were subsequently wiped out in mainly South America by competing Northern American animals.</p>
<h3 id="a-large-moon">A large moon</h3>

<p>The Moon is unusual because the other rocky planets in the Solar System either have no satellites (<a href="Mercury_(planet)" title="wikilink">Mercury</a> and <a class="uri" href="Venus" title="wikilink">Venus</a>), or have tiny satellites that are probably captured asteroids (<a class="uri" href="Mars" title="wikilink">Mars</a>).</p>

<p>The <a href="giant_impact_theory" title="wikilink">giant impact theory</a> hypothesizes that the Moon resulted from the impact of a <a class="uri" href="Mars" title="wikilink">Mars</a>-sized body, <a href="Theia_(planet)" title="wikilink">Theia</a>, with the very young Earth. This giant impact also gave the Earth its <a href="axial_tilt" title="wikilink">axial tilt</a> and velocity of rotation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Rapid rotation reduces the daily variation in temperature and makes <a class="uri" href="photosynthesis" title="wikilink">photosynthesis</a> viable.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The <em>Rare Earth</em> hypothesis further argues that the axial tilt cannot be too large or too small (relative to the <a href="orbital_plane_(astronomy)" title="wikilink">orbital plane</a>). A planet with a large tilt (inclination) will experience extreme seasonal variations in climate, unfriendly to complex life. A planet with little or no tilt will lack the stimulus to evolution that climate variation provides. In this view, the Earth's tilt is "just right". The gravity of a large satellite also stabilizes the planet's tilt; without this effect the <a href="precession" title="wikilink">variation in tilt</a> would be <a href="Chaos_theory" title="wikilink">chaotic</a>, probably making complex life forms on land impossible.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p>If the Earth had no Moon, the ocean <a href="tide" title="wikilink">tides</a> resulting solely from the Sun's gravity would be only half that of the lunar tides. A large satellite gives rise to <a href="tidal_pool" title="wikilink">tidal pools</a>, which may be essential for the formation of <a href="macromolecule" title="wikilink">complex life</a>, though this is far from certain.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p>A large satellite also increases the likelihood of <a href="plate_tectonics" title="wikilink">plate tectonics</a> through the effect of <a href="tidal_force" title="wikilink">tidal forces</a> on the planet's crust. The impact that formed the Moon may also have initiated plate tectonics, without which the <a href="continental_crust" title="wikilink">continental crust</a> would cover the entire planet, leaving no room for <a href="oceanic_crust" title="wikilink">oceanic crust</a>. It is possible that the large scale <a href="mantle_convection" title="wikilink">mantle convection</a> needed to drive plate tectonics could not have emerged in the absence of crustal inhomogeneity.</p>

<p>If a giant impact is the only way for a rocky inner planet to acquire a large satellite, any planet in the circumstellar <a href="habitable_zone" title="wikilink">habitable zone</a> will need to form as a <a href="double_planet" title="wikilink">double planet</a> in order that there be an impacting object sufficiently massive to give rise in due course to a large satellite. An impacting object of this nature is not necessarily improbable.</p>
<h3 id="an-evolutionary-trigger-for-complex-life">An evolutionary trigger for complex life</h3>

<p>Regardless of whether planets with similar physical attributes to the Earth are rare or not, some argue that life usually remains simple bacteria. Biochemist <a href="Nick_Lane" title="wikilink">Nick Lane</a> argues that simple cells (<a href="prokaryote" title="wikilink">prokaryotes</a>) emerged soon after Earth's formation, but almost half the planet's life had passed before they evolved into complex ones (<a href="eukaryote" title="wikilink">eukaryotes</a>) and because all complex life has a common origin, this event can only have happened once. In his view, <a href="prokaryote" title="wikilink">prokaryotes</a> lack the cellular architecture to evolve into eukaryotes because a bacterium expanded up to eukaryotic proportions would have tens of thousands of times less energy available; two billion years ago, one simple cell incorporated itself into another, multiplied, and evolved into <a class="uri" href="mitochondria" title="wikilink">mitochondria</a> that supplied the vast increase in available energy that enabled the evolution of complex life. If this incorporation occurred only once in four billion years or is otherwise unlikely, then life on most planets remains simple.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> An alternative view that mitochondria evolution was environmentally triggered, and that mitochondria containing organisms appear very soon after first traces of oxygen appear in Earth`s atmosphere.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-right-time-in-evolution">The right time in evolution</h3>

<p> While life on Earth is regarded to have spawned relatively early in the planet's history, the evolution to complex organs took around 800 million years<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Civilizations on Earth have existed for ~10,000 years and radio communication with space is not older than 80 years. Relative to the age of our solar system (~4.57 Ga) this is a tiny age span, an age span where extreme climatic variations, super volcanoes or large meteorite impacts were absent. These events would severely harm intelligent life, as well as life in general. For example, the <a href="Permian–Triassic_extinction_event" title="wikilink">Permian-Triassic mass extinction</a>, caused by widespread and continuous volcanic eruptions in an area the size of Western Europe, led to the extinction of 95% of known species around 251.2 <a href="Mega-annum" title="wikilink">Ma</a> ago. About 65 million years ago, the <a href="Chicxulub_crater" title="wikilink">Chicxulub</a> impact at the <a href="Cretaceous–Paleogene_boundary" title="wikilink">Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary</a> (~65.5 Ma) on the <a href="Yucatán_peninsula" title="wikilink">Yucatán peninsula</a> in <a class="uri" href="Mexico" title="wikilink">Mexico</a> led to a mass extinction of the most advanced species at that time.</p>

<p>If intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations did exist and with such an intelligence level that they could make contact with distant Earth, they would have to live in the same time span in evolution. The nearest Earth-like planets are around 11.9 light years away; probable planets as <a href="Tau_Ceti_e" title="wikilink">Tau Ceti e</a> and <a href="Tau_Ceti_f" title="wikilink">f</a> around the star <a href="Tau_Ceti" title="wikilink">Tau Ceti</a> in the constellation of <a href="Cetus_(constellation)" title="wikilink">Cetus</a>, a star considered to be 5.8 <a href="Giga-annum" title="wikilink">Ga</a>; 1.23 billion years older than the Sun.</p>

<p>Under the assumption that both the explosion of life and the development of civilization were to be relative to the planet's age, they would have spawned 723 Ma and 12.691 ka, respectively. The time between the life explosion if that had existed on an exoplanet and the dawn of civilizations is thus very large and the time between civilization and radio signals evenly so.</p>

<p>The risk of intelligent-life destruction is not a <a href="Drake_equation" title="wikilink">Drake equation</a> factor; in the 33 million years since the <a href="Eocene-Oligocene_extinction_event" title="wikilink">Eocene-Oligocene extinction event</a> there have been no major mass extinctions.</p>

<p>The chance of bigger impacts in the time span of evolution to intelligent life depends on the amount of shielding by larger bodies, such as our system's <a href="Jupiter_(planet)" title="wikilink">Jupiter</a> or the <a class="uri" href="Moon" title="wikilink">Moon</a>. The chance of a large impact and resulting <a href="mass_extinction" title="wikilink">mass extinction</a> happening in a multi-planetary "protected" system is, however, impossible to predict.</p>

<h2 id="criticism">Criticism</h2>

<p>Cases against the Rare Earth Hypothesis take various forms.</p>
<h3 id="exoplanets-with-earth-like-properties-are-being-discovered">Exoplanets with Earth-like properties are being discovered</h3>

<p>An increasing number of <a href="extrasolar_planet" title="wikilink">extrasolar planet</a> discoveries are being made with 3,548 candidate planets now known as of August 2013. These discoveries and such tools as the <a href="Kepler_(spacecraft)" title="wikilink">Kepler space telescope</a> aid estimating the frequency of Earth-like planets. Because life has not been found on other planets, and because the Copernican principle states that life should be common on these other Earth-like planets, the more Earth-like planets that are found without life increases the strength of the Rare Earth Hypothesis. In 2013 a study that was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences calculated that about "one in five" of all <a class="uri" href="sun" title="wikilink">sun</a>-like <a href="star" title="wikilink">stars</a> are expected to have earthlike planets "within the <a href="habitable_zone" title="wikilink">habitable zones</a> of their stars"; 8.8 billion of them therefore exist in the Milky Way galaxy alone.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<p><a class="uri" href="NASA" title="wikilink">NASA</a> and the <a href="SETI_Institute" title="wikilink">SETI Institute</a> now categorise Earth like planets with an <a href="Earth_Similarity_Index" title="wikilink">Earth Similarity Index</a> (ESI) of mass, radius and temperature.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p>Current technology limits the testing of important Rare Earth Criteria: surface water, tectonic plates, or a large moon, are currently undetectable, and few of the 146 documented exasolar systems have been found to resemble ours because Earth-sized planets are difficult to detect. However, a large moon and planetary arrangements that resemble that of the solar system are not necessarily important for the development of life in a system (see other reasons below).</p>

<p>On 4 November 2013, astronomers reported, based on <a href="Kepler_(spacecraft)" title="wikilink"><em>Kepler</em> space mission</a> data, that there could be as many as 40 billion <a href="Terrestrial_planet" title="wikilink">Earth-sized</a> <a href="extrasolar_planets" title="wikilink">planets</a> orbiting in the <a href="habitable_zone" title="wikilink">habitable zones</a> of <a href="sun-like" title="wikilink">sun-like stars</a> and <a href="red_dwarf_stars" title="wikilink">red dwarf stars</a> within the <a href="Milky_Way_Galaxy" title="wikilink">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> 11 billion of these estimated planets may be orbiting sun-like stars.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The nearest such planet may be 12 light-years away, according to the scientists,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> with the next closest found at 16 light-years (<a href="Gliese_832_c" title="wikilink">Gliese 832 c</a>).</p>
<h3 id="oxygen-is-not-a-requirement-for-multicellular-life">Oxygen is not a requirement for multicellular life</h3>

<p>Multicellular life, e.g., <a href="Anaerobic_organism" title="wikilink">anaerobic</a> metazoa, can exist without oxygen (despite Ward &amp; Brownlee's now disproven contrary assertion<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> ). Three multicellular species, including <a href="Spinoloricus_nov._sp." title="wikilink">Spinoloricus nov. sp.</a> discovered in the <a class="uri" href="hypersaline" title="wikilink">hypersaline</a> <a href="Anoxic_waters" title="wikilink">anoxic</a> <a href="L'Atalante_basin" title="wikilink">L'Atalante basin</a> at the bottom of the <a href="Mediterranean_Sea" title="wikilink">Mediterranean Sea</a> in 2010, appear to metabolise with hydrogen instead of oxygen, lacking <a class="uri" href="mitochondria" title="wikilink">mitochondria</a> and instead using <a class="uri" href="hydrogenosomes" title="wikilink">hydrogenosomes</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="anthropic-reasoning">Anthropic reasoning</h3>

<p>The hypothesis concludes, more or less, that complex life is rare because it can evolve only on the surface of an Earth-like planet or on a suitable satellite of a planet. Some biologists, such as <a href="Jack_Cohen_(scientist)" title="wikilink">Jack Cohen</a>, believe this assumption too restrictive and unimaginative; they see it as a form of <a href="begging_the_question" title="wikilink">circular reasoning</a>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="David_Darling_(astronomer)" title="wikilink">David Darling</a>, the Rare Earth hypothesis is neither <a class="uri" href="hypothesis" title="wikilink">hypothesis</a> nor <a class="uri" href="prediction" title="wikilink">prediction</a>, but merely a description of how life arose on Earth.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> In his view Ward and Brownlee have done nothing more than select the factors that best suit their case.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>What matters is not whether there's anything unusual about the Earth; there's going to be something <a class="uri" href="idiosyncratic" title="wikilink">idiosyncratic</a> about every planet in space. What matters is whether any of Earth's circumstances are not only unusual but also essential for complex life. So far we've seen nothing to suggest there is.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Critics also argue that there is a link between the Rare Earth Hypothesis and the creationist ideas of intelligent design.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="alternative-habitats-for-complex-life">Alternative habitats for complex Life</h3>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>Complex life may exist elsewhere in environments similar to those found around <a href="black_smoker" title="wikilink">black smokers</a> on Earth.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Rare Earth proponents argue that simple life may be common, though complex life requires specific environmental conditions to arise. Some argue that complex life may exist in such diverse habitats as those beyond the Solar System's habitable zone and on non-planetary bodies where both water and an active energy source may exist. For example, sub-surface water habitats that are warmed by <a href="tidal_heating" title="wikilink">tidal heating</a> may exist on <a href="Europa_(moon)" title="wikilink">Europa</a> and <a href="Enceladus_(moon)" title="wikilink">Enceladus</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Some theories on the origin of life on Earth indicate that complex life evolved in such environments before arising on the surface.</p>
<h3 id="uncertainty-over-jupiters-role">Uncertainty over Jupiter's role</h3>

<p>The assertion that Jupiter's mass guards the terrestrial planets from impacts has been challenged. Since Rare Earth, the 2005 <a href="Nice_model" title="wikilink">Nice model</a> and 2007 <a href="Nice_2_model" title="wikilink">Nice 2 model</a> have provided computer modelling of planetary formation. A study by Horner &amp; Jones (2008) using computer simulation found that while the total effect on all orbital bodies within the Solar System is unclear, Jupiter has caused more impacts on Earth than it has prevented.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="necessity-of-tectonics">Necessity of tectonics</h3>

<p>Ward &amp; Brownlee argue that <a class="uri" href="tectonics" title="wikilink">tectonics</a> is necessary to support <a href="biogeochemical_cycles" title="wikilink">biogeochemical cycles</a> required for intelligent life and that such geological features are unique to Earth and that such processes do not occur elsewhere citing the lack of any observable <a class="uri" href="orogenic" title="wikilink">orogenic</a> evidence. However recent evidence points to similar activity either having occurred or continuing to occur on other terrestrial objects including Mars,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Venus,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Titan,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Europa,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Enceladus<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> and the Moon.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Several more natural satellites exhibit similar processes, though these may have different mechanisms.</p>

<p>Many Rare Earth proponents argue that the Earth's plate tectonics would probably not exist if not for the tidal forces of the moon. However the hypothesis that the moon's tidal influence initiated Earth's plate tectonics remains unproven. Additionally, strong evidence suggests that plate tectonics existed on <a class="uri" href="Mars" title="wikilink">Mars</a>, which does not currently have a large companion.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>

<p>NASA scientists Hartman and McKay argue that plate tectonics may in fact slow the rise of oxygenation (and thus stymie complex life rather than promote it).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Computer modelling by Tilman Spohn in 2014 found that plate tectonics on Earth may have arisen from the effects of complex life's emergence, rather than the other way around as the Rare Earth might suggest. The action of lichens on rock may have contributed to the formation of subduction zones in the presence of water.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="giant-impacts-may-not-be-rare-nor-necessary-for-rotational-speed">Giant impacts may not be rare nor necessary for rotational speed</h3>

<p>Recent work by <a href="Edward_Belbruno" title="wikilink">Edward Belbruno</a> and <a href="J._Richard_Gott" title="wikilink">J. Richard Gott</a> of Princeton University suggests that giant impacts such as those that may have formed the Moon can indeed form in planetary <a href="trojan_points" title="wikilink">trojan points</a> ( or  <a href="Lagrangian_point" title="wikilink">Lagrangian point</a>) which means that similar circumstances may occur in other planetary systems.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>

<p>Although the <a href="giant_impact_theory" title="wikilink">giant impact theory</a> posits that the impact forming the Moon increased Earth's rotational speed to make a day about 5 hours long, the Moon has slowly "<a href="Tidal_deceleration#Tidal_deceleration" title="wikilink">stolen</a>" much of this speed to reduce Earth's solar day since then to about 24 hours and continues to do so: in 100 million years Earth's solar day will be roughly 24 hours 38 minutes, in 1 billion 30 hours 23 minutes. Larger secondary bodies would exert proportionally larger tidal forces that would in turn decelerate their primaries faster and potentially increase the solar day of a planet in all other respects like earth to over 120 hours within a few billion years. This long solar day would make effective heat dissipation for organisms in the tropics and subtropics extremely difficult in a similar manner to tidal locking to a red dwarf star. Short days (high rotation speed) causes high wind speeds at ground level. Long days (slow rotation speed) causes the day/night temperatures to be too extreme.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
