<h1>Drake equation</h1>
<hr/>

<p> The <strong>Drake equation</strong> is a <a href="probability_theory" title="wikilink">probabilistic argument</a> used to arrive at an estimate of the number of active, communicative <a href="extraterrestrial_life" title="wikilink">extraterrestrial civilizations</a> in the <a href="Milky_Way" title="wikilink">Milky Way</a> <a class="uri" href="galaxy" title="wikilink">galaxy</a>. The equations sets this number of civilizations, <em>N</em>, in our galaxy for which radio-communication might be possible equal to the mathematical product of (i) the average rate of star formation, <em>R<sub>*</sub></em>, in our galaxy, (ii) the fraction of formed stars, <em>f<sub>p</sub></em>, that have planets, (iii) the average number of planets per star that has planets, <em>n<sub>e</sub></em>, that can potentially support life, (iv) the fraction of those planets, <em>f<sub>l</sub></em>, that actually develop life, (v) the fraction of planets bearing life on which intelligent, civilized life, <em>f<sub>i</sub></em>, has developed, (vi) the fraction of these civilizations that have developed communications, <em>f<sub>c</sub></em>, i.e., technologies that release detectable signs into space, and (vii) the length of time, <em>L</em>, over which such civilizations release detectable signals, for a combined expression of:</p>

 The equation was written in 1961 by <a href="Frank_Drake" title="wikilink">Frank Drake</a> not for purposes of quantifying the number of civilizations,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> but as a way to stimulate scientific dialogue at a meeting on the <a href="search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence" title="wikilink">search for extraterrestrial intelligence</a> (SETI). The equation summarizes the main concepts which scientists must contemplate when considering the question of other radio-communicative life.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Criticism of the Drake equation follows from the fact that several of its terms are conjectural, the net result being that the error associated with any derived value is very large such that the equation cannot be used to draw firm conclusions. A consistent reply to these critiques is that the formalism was intended to stimulate dialogue, indeed, that this was Drake's original intent (and the evidence is clear that it has done so).</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>In September 1959, physicists <a href="Giuseppe_Cocconi" title="wikilink">Giuseppe Cocconi</a> and <a href="Philip_Morrison" title="wikilink">Philip Morrison</a> published an article in the journal <em><a href="Nature_(journal)" title="wikilink">Nature</a></em> with the provocative title "Searching for Interstellar Communications."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Cocconi and Morrison argued that <a href="radio_telescope" title="wikilink">radio telescopes</a> had become sensitive enough to pick up transmissions that might be broadcast into space by civilizations orbiting other stars. Such messages, they suggested, might be transmitted at a <a class="uri" href="wavelength" title="wikilink">wavelength</a> of 21 centimeters (1,420.4 <a href="Hertz" title="wikilink">megahertz</a>). This is the wavelength of radio emission by neutral <a class="uri" href="hydrogen" title="wikilink">hydrogen</a>, the most common element in the universe, and they reasoned that other intelligences might see this as a logical landmark in the <a href="radio_spectrum" title="wikilink">radio spectrum</a>.</p>

<p>Seven months later, radio astronomer Frank Drake made the first systematic search for signals from extraterrestrial intelligent beings. Using the 25 meter dish of the <a href="National_Radio_Astronomy_Observatory" title="wikilink">National Radio Astronomy Observatory</a> in <a href="Green_Bank,_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">Green Bank, West Virginia</a>, Drake monitored two nearby Sun-like stars: <a href="Epsilon_Eridani" title="wikilink">Epsilon Eridani</a> and <a href="Tau_Ceti" title="wikilink">Tau Ceti</a>. In this project, which he called <a href="Project_Ozma" title="wikilink">Project Ozma</a>, he slowly scanned frequencies close to the 21 cm wavelength for six hours a day from April to July 1960.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The project was well designed, inexpensive, and simple by today's standards. It was also unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Soon thereafter, Drake hosted a "<a href="search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence" title="wikilink">search for extraterrestrial intelligence</a>" meeting on detecting their radio signals. The meeting was held at the Green Bank facility in 1961. The equation that bears Drake's name arose out of his preparations for the meeting.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>

<p>As I planned the meeting, I realized a few day[s] ahead of time we needed an agenda. And so I wrote down all the things you needed to know to predict how hard it's going to be to detect extraterrestrial life. And looking at them it became pretty evident that if you multiplied all these together, you got a number, N, which is the number of detectable civilizations in our galaxy. This was aimed at the radio search, and not to search for primordial or primitive life forms. —Frank Drake.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ten attendees were conference organizer J. Peter Pearman, Frank Drake, <a href="Philip_Morrison" title="wikilink">Philip Morrison</a>, businessman and radio amateur Dana Atchley, chemist <a href="Melvin_Calvin" title="wikilink">Melvin Calvin</a>, astronomer <a href="Su-Shu_Huang" title="wikilink">Su-Shu Huang</a>, neuroscientist <a href="John_C._Lilly" title="wikilink">John C. Lilly</a>, inventor <a href="Barney_Oliver" title="wikilink">Barney Oliver</a>, astronomer <a href="Carl_Sagan" title="wikilink">Carl Sagan</a> and radio-astronomer <a href="Otto_Struve" title="wikilink">Otto Struve</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> These participants dubbed themselves "The Order of the Dolphin" (because of Lilly's work on dolphin communication), and commemorated their first meeting with a plaque at the observatory hall.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

, are not known and are very hard to estimate, with values ranging over many orders of magnitude (see <a href="#Criticism" title="wikilink">criticism</a>). Therefore, the usefulness of the Drake equation is not in the solving, but rather in the contemplation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The equation is quite useful for its intended application, which is to summarize all the various concepts which scientists must contemplate when considering the question of life elsewhere,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and gives the question of life elsewhere a basis for <a href="Scientific_method" title="wikilink">scientific analysis</a>. The Drake equation is a statement that stimulates intellectual curiosity about the <a class="uri" href="universe" title="wikilink">universe</a> around us, for helping us to understand that <a class="uri" href="life" title="wikilink">life</a> as we know it is the end product of a natural, cosmic evolution, and for helping us realize how much we are a part of that universe.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> What the equation and the search for life has done is focus science on some of the other questions about life in the universe, specifically <a class="uri" href="abiogenesis" title="wikilink">abiogenesis</a>, the development of multi-cellular life and the development of <a class="uri" href="intelligence" title="wikilink">intelligence</a> itself.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>Within the limits of our existing technology, any practical search for distant intelligent life must necessarily be a search for some manifestation of a distant technology. After about 50 years, the Drake equation is still of seminal importance because it is a 'road map' of what we need to learn in order to solve this fundamental existential question.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> It also formed the backbone of <a class="uri" href="astrobiology" title="wikilink">astrobiology</a> as a science; although speculation is entertained to give context, astrobiology concerns itself primarily with <a class="uri" href="hypotheses" title="wikilink">hypotheses</a> that fit firmly into existing <a href="Theory#Science" title="wikilink">scientific theories</a>. Some 50 years of SETI have failed to find anything, even though radio telescopes, receiver techniques, and computational abilities have improved enormously since the early 1960s, but it has been discovered, at least, that our galaxy is not teeming with very powerful alien transmitters continuously broadcasting near the 21 cm hydrogen frequency. No one could say this in 1961.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="modifications">Modifications</h2>

<p>As many observers have pointed out, the Drake equation is a very simple model that does not include potentially relevant parameters,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> and many changes and modifications to the equation have been proposed. One line of modification, for example, attempts to account for the uncertainty inherent in many of the terms.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p>Others note that the Drake equation ignores many concepts that might be relevant to the odds of contacting other civilizations. For example, <a href="David_Brin" title="wikilink">David Brin</a> states: "The Drake equation merely speaks of the number of sites at which ETIs spontaneously arise. The equation says nothing directly about the contact cross-section between an ETIS and contemporary human society".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Because it is the contact cross-section that is of interest to the SETI community, many additional factors and modifications of the Drake equation have been proposed.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Colonization</dt>
</dl>

<p>It has been proposed to generalize the Drake equation to include additional effects of alien civilizations colonizing other <a href="star_system" title="wikilink">star systems</a>. Each original site expands with an expansion velocity <em>v</em>, and establishes additional sites that survive for a lifetime <em>L</em>. The result is a more complex set of 3 equations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<dl>
<dt>Reappearance factor</dt>
</dl>

<p>The Drake equation may furthermore be multiplied by <em>how many times</em> an intelligent civilization may occur on planets where it has happened once. Even if an intelligent civilization reaches the end of its lifetime after, for example, 10,000 years, life may still prevail on the planet for billions of years, permitting the next <a href="Sociocultural_evolution" title="wikilink">civilization to evolve</a>. Thus, several civilizations may come and go during the lifespan of one and the same planet. Thus, if <em>n</em><sub><em>r</em></sub> is the average number of times a new civilization <em>re</em>appears on the same planet where a previous civilization once has appeared and ended, then the total number of civilizations on such a planet would be (1+<em>n</em><sub><em>r</em></sub>), which is the actual <em>reappearance factor</em> added to the equation.</p>

<p>The factor depends on what generally is the cause of <a href="civilization_extinction" title="wikilink">civilization extinction</a>. If it is generally by temporary uninhabitability, for example a <a href="nuclear_winter" title="wikilink">nuclear winter</a>, then <em>n</em><sub><em>r</em></sub> may be relatively high. On the other hand, if it is generally by permanent uninhabitability, such as <a href="stellar_evolution" title="wikilink">stellar evolution</a>, then <em>n</em><sub><em>r</em></sub> may be almost zero. In the case of total life extinction, a similar factor may be applicable for <em>f</em><sub>ℓ</sub>, that is, <em>how many times</em> life may appear on a planet where it has appeared once.</p>
<dl>
<dt>METI factor</dt>
</dl>

<p><a href="Aleksandr_Leonidovich_Zaitsev" title="wikilink">Alexander Zaitsev</a> said that to be in a communicative phase and emit dedicated messages are not the same. For example, humans, although being in a communicative phase, are not a communicative civilization; we do not practise such activities as the purposeful and regular transmission of interstellar messages. For this reason, he suggested introducing the METI factor (Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) to the classical Drake equation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> He defined the factor as "the fraction of communicative civilizations with clear and non-paranoid planetary consciousness", or alternatively expressed, the fraction of communicative civilizations that actually engage in deliberate interstellar transmission.</p>

<p>The METI factor is somewhat misleading since active, purposeful transmission of messages by a civilization is not required for them to receive a broadcast sent by another that is seeking first contact. It is merely required they have capable and compatible receiver systems operational; however, this is a variable humans cannot accurately estimate.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Biogenic gases</dt>
</dl>

<p>Astronomer <a href="Sara_Seager" title="wikilink">Sara Seager</a> proposed a revised equation that focuses on the search for planets with biosignature gases. These gases are produced by living organisms that can accumulate in a planet atmosphere to levels that can be detected with remote space telescopes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="estimates">Estimates</h2>
<h3 id="original-estimates">Original estimates</h3>

<p>There is considerable disagreement on the values of these parameters, but the 'educated guesses' used by Drake and his colleagues in 1961 were:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><em>R</em><sub>*</sub> = 1/year (1 star formed per year, on the average over the life of the galaxy; this was regarded as conservative)</li>
<li><em>f</em><sub>p</sub> = 0.2-0.5 (one fifth to one half of all stars formed will have planets)</li>
<li><em>n</em><sub>e</sub> = 1-5 (stars with planets will have between 1 and 5 planets capable of developing life)</li>
<li><em>f</em><sub>l</sub> = 1 (100% of these planets will develop life)</li>
<li><em>f</em><sub>i</sub> = 1 (100% of which will develop intelligent life)</li>
<li><em>f</em><sub>c</sub> = 0.1-0.2 (10-20% of which will be able to communicate)</li>
<li><em>L</em> = 1000-100,000,000 years (which will last somewhere between 1000 and 100,000,000 years)</li>
</ul>

<p>Inserting the above minimum numbers into the equation gives a minimum N of 20. Inserting the maximum numbers gives a maximum of 50,000,000. Drake states that given the uncertainties, the original meeting concluded that <em>N ≈ L</em>, and there were probably between 1000 and 100,000,000 civilizations in the <a href="Milky_Way" title="wikilink">Milky Way</a> galaxy.</p>

<dd>The discovery of numerous <a href="gas_giant" title="wikilink">gas giants</a> in close orbit with their stars has introduced doubt that life-supporting planets commonly survive the formation of their stellar systems. So-called <a href="hot_Jupiter" title="wikilink">hot Jupiters</a> may migrate from distant orbits to near orbits, in the process disrupting the orbits of habitable planets.

<dd>In addition, most stars in our galaxy are <a href="red_dwarf" title="wikilink">red dwarfs</a>, which flare violently, mostly in <a href="X-ray" title="wikilink">X-rays</a>, a property not conducive to life as we know it. Simulations also suggest that these bursts erode planetary atmosphere.

<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, the variety of <a href="star_system" title="wikilink">star systems</a> that might have habitable zones is not just limited to solar-type stars and Earth-sized planets; it is now estimated that even tidally locked planets close to <a href="habitability_of_red_dwarf_systems" title="wikilink">red dwarfs might have habitable zones</a>.<ref>

<dl>
<dd>Geological evidence from the Earth suggests that <em>f</em><sub>l</sub> may be high; life on Earth appears to have begun around the same time as favorable conditions arose, suggesting that <a class="uri" href="abiogenesis" title="wikilink">abiogenesis</a> may be relatively common once conditions are right. However, this evidence only looks at the Earth (a single model planet), and contains <a href="anthropic_bias" title="wikilink">anthropic bias</a>, as the planet of study was not chosen randomly, but by the living organisms that already inhabit it (ourselves). From a classical <a href="hypothesis_testing" title="wikilink">hypothesis testing</a> standpoint, there are zero <a href="degrees_of_freedom_(statistics)" title="wikilink">degrees of freedom</a>, permitting no valid estimates to be made. If life were to be found on <a href="life_on_Mars" title="wikilink">Mars</a> that developed independently from life on Earth it would imply a value for <em>f</em><sub>l</sub> close to one. While this would improve the degrees of freedom from zero to one, there would remain a great deal of uncertainty on any estimate due to the small sample size, and the chance they are not really independent.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Countering this argument is that there is no evidence for abiogenesis occurring more than once on the Earth — that is, all terrestrial life stems from a common origin. If abiogenesis were more common it would be speculated to have occurred more than once on the Earth. Scientists have searched for this by looking for <a class="uri" href="bacteria" title="wikilink">bacteria</a> that are unrelated to other life on Earth, but none have been found yet.<ref>
</ref></dd>
</dl>

<p> It is also possible that life arose more than once, but that other branches were out-competed, or died in mass extinctions, or were lost in other ways. Biochemists <a href="Francis_Crick" title="wikilink">Francis Crick</a> and <a href="Leslie_Orgel" title="wikilink">Leslie Orgel</a> laid special emphasis on this uncertainty: "At the moment we have no means at all of knowing" whether we are "likely to be alone in the galaxy (Universe)" or whether "the galaxy may be pullulating with life of many different forms."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> As an alternative to abiogenesis on Earth, they proposed the hypothesis of <a href="directed_panspermia" title="wikilink">directed panspermia</a>, which states that Earth life began with "microorganisms sent here deliberately by a technological society on another planet, by means of a special long-range unmanned spaceship" (Crick and Orgel, <em>op.cit.</em>).</p>
<h4 id="fraction-of-the-above-that-develops-intelligent-life-fi">Fraction of the above that develops intelligent life, <em>f<sub>i</sub></em></h4>
<dl>
<dd>This value remains particularly controversial. Those who favor a low value, such as the biologist <a href="Ernst_Mayr" title="wikilink">Ernst Mayr</a>, point out that of the billions of species that have existed on Earth, only one has become intelligent and from this, infer a tiny value for <em>f</em><sub>i</sub>.<ref name="Ernst Mayr on SETI">

<dl>
<dd>In addition, while it appears that life developed soon after the formation of Earth, the <a href="Cambrian_explosion" title="wikilink">Cambrian explosion</a>, in which a large variety of multicellular life forms came into being, occurred a considerable amount of time after the formation of Earth, which suggests the possibility that special conditions were necessary. Some scenarios such as the <a href="Snowball_Earth" title="wikilink">Snowball Earth</a> or research into the <a href="extinction_events" title="wikilink">extinction events</a> have raised the possibility that life on Earth is relatively fragile. Research on any past <a href="life_on_Mars" title="wikilink">life on Mars</a> is relevant since a discovery that life did form on Mars but ceased to exist might raise our estimate of f<sub>l</sub> but would indicate that in half the known cases, intelligent life did not develop.

<p> Using 28 civilizations more recent than the Roman Empire, he calculates a figure of 304 years for "modern" civilizations. It could also be argued from Michael Shermer's results that the fall of most of these civilizations was followed by later civilizations that carried on the technologies, so it is doubtful that they are separate civilizations in the context of the Drake equation. In the expanded version, including <em>reappearance number</em>, this lack of specificity in defining single civilizations does not matter for the end result, since such a civilization turnover could be described as an increase in the <em>reappearance number</em> rather than increase in <em>L</em>, stating that a civilization reappears in the form of the succeeding cultures.

<dd>The astronomer <a href="Carl_Sagan" title="wikilink">Carl Sagan</a> speculated that all of the terms, except for the lifetime of a civilization, are relatively high and the determining factor in whether there are large or small numbers of civilizations in the universe is the civilization lifetime, or in other words, the ability of technological civilizations to avoid self-destruction.

<dd>Inserting these current estimates into the original equation, using a value of 0.1 wherever the text says someone has proposed an unspecified "low value," results in the range of N being from a low of 2 to a high of 280,000,000.

<h3 id="range-of-results">Range of results</h3>

<p>As many skeptics have pointed out, the Drake equation can give a very wide range of values, depending on the assumptions. One point of wide agreement is that the presence of humanity implies a probability of intelligence arising of greater than nil (zero).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Beyond this, however, the values one may attribute to each factor in this equation tell more about a person's beliefs than about scientific facts.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>Using lowest values in the above estimates, and assuming the <a href="rare_Earth_hypothesis" title="wikilink">rare Earth hypothesis</a> implies <em>n</em><sub>e</sub>*<em>f</em><sub>l</sub> = 10<sup>−11</sup>, one can calculate <em>N</em>:</p>

<h2 id="criticism">Criticism</h2>

<p>Criticism of the Drake equation follows mostly from the observation that several terms in the equation are largely or entirely based on conjecture. Star formation rates are well-known, and the incidence of planets has a sound theoretical and observational basis, but the other terms in the equation become very speculative. The uncertainties revolve around our understanding of the evolution of life, intelligence, and civilization, not physics. No statistical estimates are possible for some of the parameters, where only one example is known. The net result is that the equation cannot be used to draw firm conclusions of any kind, and the resulting margin of error is huge, far beyond what some consider acceptable or meaningful.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<p>One reply to such criticisms<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> is that even though the Drake equation currently involves speculation about unmeasured parameters, it was intended as a way to stimulate dialogue on these topics. Then the focus becomes how to proceed experimentally. Indeed, Drake originally formulated the equation merely as an agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="fermi-paradox">Fermi paradox</h3>

<p>The pessimists' most telling argument in the SETI debate stems not from theory or conjecture but from an actual observation: the presumed lack of extraterrestrial contact.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> A civilization lasting for tens of millions of years would have plenty of time to travel anywhere in the galaxy, even at the slow speeds <a href="100_Year_Starship" title="wikilink">foreseeable with our own kind of technology</a>. Furthermore, no confirmed signs of intelligence elsewhere have been spotted, either in our galaxy or the more than 80 billion other galaxies of the <a href="observable_universe" title="wikilink">observable universe</a>. According to this line of thinking, the tendency to fill up all available territory seems to be a universal trait of living things, so the Earth should have already been colonized, or at least visited, but no evidence of this exists. Hence Fermi's question "Where is everybody?".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>

<p>A large number of explanations have been proposed to explain this lack of contact; a recent book elaborated on 50 different explanations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> In terms of the Drake Equation, the explanations can be divided into three classes:</p>
