<p><a href="File:BNSF_GE_Dash-9_C44-9W_Kennewick_-_Wishram_WA.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|right|upright=1.2|Four </a><a class="uri" href="BNSF" title="wikilink">BNSF</a> <a href="GE_C44-9W" title="wikilink">GE C44-9W</a> diesel locomotives hauling a mixed freight train along the banks of the <a href="Columbia_River" title="wikilink">Columbia River</a>, between <a href="Kennewick,_Washington" title="wikilink">Kennewick</a> and <a href="Wishram,_Washington" title="wikilink">Wishram</a>, <a href="Washington_(state)" title="wikilink">Washington State</a>, <a href="United_States_of_America" title="wikilink">USA</a> <strong>Rail transport</strong> is a means of <a href="transport" title="wikilink">conveyance of passengers and goods</a>, by way of wheeled vehicles running on <a href="Track_(rail_transport)" title="wikilink">rails</a>. It is also commonly referred to as train transport. In contrast to <a href="road_transport" title="wikilink">road transport</a>, where vehicles run on a prepared flat surface, rail vehicles are also directionally guided by the tracks on which they run. Track usually consists of <a class="uri" href="steel" title="wikilink">steel</a> rails, installed on <a href="Railroad_tie" title="wikilink">ties</a> (sleepers) and <a href="track_ballast" title="wikilink">ballast</a>, on which the <a href="rolling_stock" title="wikilink">rolling stock</a>, usually fitted with metal <a href="wheel" title="wikilink">wheels</a>, moves. However, other variations are also possible, such as slab track where the rails are fastened to a concrete foundation resting on a prepared subsurface.</p>

<p>Rolling stock in railway transport systems generally has lower frictional resistance when compared with <a class="uri" href="highway" title="wikilink">highway</a> vehicles and the passenger and freight cars (carriages and wagons) can be coupled into longer <a class="uri" href="trains" title="wikilink">trains</a>. The <a href="rail_transport_operations" title="wikilink">operation</a> is carried out by a <a href="railway_company" title="wikilink">railway company</a>, providing transport between <a href="train_station" title="wikilink">train stations</a> or freight customer facilities. Power is provided by <a href="locomotive" title="wikilink">locomotives</a> which either draw <a href="electrical_power" title="wikilink">electrical power</a> from a <a href="railway_electrification_system" title="wikilink">railway electrification system</a> or produce their own power, usually by <a href="diesel_engine" title="wikilink">diesel engines</a>. Most tracks are accompanied by a <a href="railroad_signaling" title="wikilink">signalling system</a>. Railways are a safe land transport system when compared to other forms of transport.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Railway transport is capable of high levels of passenger and cargo utilization and energy efficiency, but is often less flexible and more <a href="capital_(economics)" title="wikilink">capital</a>-intensive than <a class="uri" href="highway" title="wikilink">highway</a> transport is, when lower traffic levels are considered.</p>

<p>The oldest, man-hauled railways date back to the 6th century B.C, with <a class="uri" href="Periander" title="wikilink">Periander</a>, one of the <a href="Seven_Sages_of_Greece" title="wikilink">Seven Sages of Greece</a>, credited with its invention. Rail transport blossomed after the British development of the <a href="steam_locomotive" title="wikilink">steam locomotive</a> as a viable source of the power in the 18th and 19th centuries. With steam engines, it was possible to construct mainline railways, which were a key component of the <a href="industrial_revolution" title="wikilink">industrial revolution</a>. Also, railways reduced the costs of <a class="uri" href="shipping" title="wikilink">shipping</a>, and allowed for fewer lost goods, compared with shipping, which faced occasional sinking of ships. The change from canals to railways allowed for "national markets" in which prices varied very little from city to city. Studies have shown that the invention and development of the railway in Europe was one of the most important technological inventions of the late 19th century for the United States, without which, GDP would have been lower by 7.0% in 1890.</p>

<p>In the 1880s, <a href="electricity" title="wikilink">electrified</a> trains were introduced, and also the first tramways and rapid transit systems came into being. Starting during the 1940s, the non-electrified railways in most countries had their steam <a href="locomotive" title="wikilink">locomotives</a> replaced by <a href="diesel_fuel" title="wikilink">diesel</a>-electric locomotives, with the process being almost complete by 2000. During the 1960s, electrified <a href="high-speed_rail" title="wikilink">high-speed railway systems</a> were introduced in <a class="uri" href="Japan" title="wikilink">Japan</a> and later in some other countries. Other forms of guided ground transport outside the traditional railway definitions, such as <a class="uri" href="monorail" title="wikilink">monorail</a> or <a href="Maglev_(transport)" title="wikilink">maglev</a>, have been tried but have seen limited use.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The history of the growth, decline and restoration to use of rail transport can be divided up into several discrete periods defined by the principal means of motive power used.</p>
<h3 id="pre-steam">Pre-steam</h3>

<p> The earliest evidence of a railway was a  <a class="uri" href="Diolkos" title="wikilink">Diolkos</a> <a class="uri" href="wagonway" title="wikilink">wagonway</a>, which transported boats across the <a class="uri" href="Corinth" title="wikilink">Corinth</a> isthmus in Greece during the 6th century BC. Trucks pushed by slaves ran in grooves in limestone, which provided the track element. The Diolkos operated for over 600 years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Railways began reappearing in Europe after the <a href="Dark_Ages_(historiography)" title="wikilink">Dark Ages</a>. The earliest known record of a railway in Europe from this period is a stained-glass window in the <a href="Freiburg_Minster" title="wikilink">Minster of Freiburg im Breisgau</a> in Germany, dating from around 1350.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In 1515, <a href="Matthäus_Lang" title="wikilink">Cardinal Matthäus Lang</a> wrote a description of the <a class="uri" href="Reisszug" title="wikilink">Reisszug</a>, a <a href="funicular" title="wikilink">funicular railway</a> at the <a href="Hohensalzburg_Castle" title="wikilink">Hohensalzburg Castle</a> in <a class="uri" href="Austria" title="wikilink">Austria</a>. The line originally used wooden rails and a <a class="uri" href="hemp" title="wikilink">hemp</a> haulage rope, and was operated by human or animal power. The line still exists, albeit in updated form, and is one of the oldest railways still to operate.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>By 1550, <a href="narrow_gauge_railways" title="wikilink">narrow gauge railways</a> with wooden rails were common in mines in Europe.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> By the early 17th century, wooden wagonways were common in England and Wales for transporting coal from mines to canal wharfs for <a class="uri" href="transshipment" title="wikilink">transshipment</a> to boats. The world's oldest working railway, built in 1758, is the <a href="Middleton_Railway" title="wikilink">Middleton Railway</a> in <a class="uri" href="Leeds" title="wikilink">Leeds</a>. In 1764, the first <a href="gravity_railroad" title="wikilink">gravity railroad</a> in the United States was built in <a href="Lewiston,_New_York" title="wikilink">Lewiston, New York</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The first permanent tramway was the <a href="Leiper_Railroad" title="wikilink">Leiper Railroad</a> in 1810.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>The first iron plate railway, made with <a href="wrought_iron" title="wikilink">wrought iron</a> plates on top of wooden rails, came into use in 1768.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> This allowed a variation of <a href="rail_gauge" title="wikilink">gauge</a> to be used. At first only <a href="balloon_loop" title="wikilink">balloon loops</a> could be used for turning, but later, movable points were taken into use that allowed for switching.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> From the 1790s, iron edge rails began to appear in Great Britain.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In 1803, <a href="William_Jessop" title="wikilink">William Jessop</a> opened the <a href="Surrey_Iron_Railway" title="wikilink">Surrey Iron Railway</a> in south London, arguably the world's first horse-drawn public railway.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The invention of the <a href="wrought_iron" title="wikilink">wrought iron</a> rail by <a href="John_Birkinshaw" title="wikilink">John Birkinshaw</a> in 1820 allowed the short, brittle, and often uneven, cast iron rails to be extended to  lengths.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> These were succeeded by <a class="uri" href="steel" title="wikilink">steel</a> in 1857.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="age-of-steam">Age of steam</h3>

<p>The development of the <a href="steam_engine" title="wikilink">steam engine</a> during the <a href="Industrial_Revolution" title="wikilink">Industrial Revolution</a> in Great Britain, initially for pumping water, spurred ideas for mobile <a href="steam_locomotive" title="wikilink">steam locomotives</a> that could haul heavy weights on tracks. <a href="James_Watt" title="wikilink">James Watt</a>'s patented steam engines of 1769 (patent revised in 1782) were heavy low-pressure engines which were not suitable for use in locomotives. However, in 1804, using high-pressure steam, <a href="Richard_Trevithick" title="wikilink">Richard Trevithick</a> demonstrated the first <a class="uri" href="locomotive" title="wikilink">locomotive</a>-hauled train at <a href="Merthyr_Tydfil" title="wikilink">Merthyr Tydfil</a>, in <a href="South_Wales" title="wikilink">South Wales</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Accompanied with <a href="Andrew_Vivian" title="wikilink">Andrew Vivian</a>, it ran with mixed success,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> breaking some of the brittle cast-iron plates.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Two years later, the first passenger <a href="horse-drawn_railway" title="wikilink">horse-drawn railway</a> was opened nearby between <a class="uri" href="Swansea" title="wikilink">Swansea</a> and <a class="uri" href="Mumbles" title="wikilink">Mumbles</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="earliest-british-steam-railways">Earliest British steam railways</h4>

<p>In 1811, <a href="John_Blenkinsop" title="wikilink">John Blenkinsop</a> designed the first successful and practical railway locomotive<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a>—a <a href="rack_railway" title="wikilink">rack railway</a> worked by a steam locomotive between Middleton Colliery and <a class="uri" href="Leeds" title="wikilink">Leeds</a> on the <a href="Middleton_Railway" title="wikilink">Middleton Railway</a>. His first locomotive, called <em><a href="Salamanca_(locomotive)" title="wikilink">Salamanca</a></em>, was built the following year.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In 1825, <a href="George_Stephenson" title="wikilink">George Stephenson</a> built the <em><a href="Locomotion_No_1" title="wikilink">Locomotion</a></em> for the <a href="Stockton_and_Darlington_Railway" title="wikilink">Stockton and Darlington Railway</a>, north east England, which was the first public steam railway in the world. In 1829, he built the <em><a href="Stephenson's_Rocket" title="wikilink">Rocket</a></em>, which was entered in and won the <a href="Rainhill_Trials" title="wikilink">Rainhill Trials</a>. This success led to Stephenson establishing his company as the pre-eminent builder of steam locomotives for Railways in Great Britain and Ireland, the United States, and much of Europe.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1830, the first <a href="intercity_rail" title="wikilink">intercity</a> route, the <a href="Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway" title="wikilink">Liverpool and Manchester Railway</a>, was opened. The gauge was that used for the early wagon-ways, which had been adopted for the Stockton and Darlington Railway,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> with a  width which became known as the international <a href="standard_gauge" title="wikilink">standard gauge</a>, still used by about 60% of the world's railways. This spurred the spread of rail transport outside the British Isles.</p>

<p>By the early 1850s, Great Britain had over  of railway, a stunning achievement given that only twenty years had elapsed since the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="early-railroads-in-the-us">Early railroads in the US</h4>

<p>Railroads (as they are known in the US) were built on a far larger scale than those in Continental Europe, both in terms of the distances covered, and also in the <a href="loading_gauge" title="wikilink">loading gauge</a> adopted, which allowed for heavier locomotives and double-deck trains. The railroad era in the United States began in 1830 when Peter Cooper's locomotive, <a href="Tom_Thumb_(locomotive)" title="wikilink"><em>Tom Thumb</em></a>, first steamed along  of <a href="Baltimore_and_Ohio_Railroad" title="wikilink">Baltimore and Ohio railroad</a> track.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In 1833, the nation's second railroad ran  from Charleston to Hamburg in South Carolina.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Not until the 1850s, though, did railroads offer long distance service at reasonable rates. A journey from Philadelphia to Charleston involved eight different gauges, which meant that passengers and freight had to change trains seven times. Only at places like Bowling Green, Kentucky, were the railroads connected to one another.</p>

<p>The <a href="Baltimore_and_Ohio_Railroad" title="wikilink">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</a> that opened in 1830 was the first to evolve from a single line to a network in the United States.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> By 1831, a steam railway connected Albany and Schenectady, New York, a distance of , which was covered in 40 minutes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p>The years between 1850 and 1890 saw phenomenal growth in the US railroad system, which at its peak constituted one third of the world's total mileage.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Although the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a> placed a temporary halt to major new developments, the conflict did demonstrate the enormous strategic importance of railways at times of war. After the war, major developments include the first elevated railway built in New York in 1867 as well as the symbolically important <a href="First_Transcontinental_Railroad" title="wikilink">first transcontinental railroad</a> completed in 1869.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="electrification-and-dieselisation">Electrification and dieselisation</h3>

<p>  Experiments with electrical railways were started by <a href="Robert_Davidson_(inventor)" title="wikilink">Robert Davidson</a> in 1838. He completed a battery-powered carriage capable of . The <a href="Gross-Lichterfelde_Tramway" title="wikilink">Gross-Lichterfelde Tramway</a> was the first to use electricity fed to the trains en route, when it opened in 1881. <a href="Overhead_wire" title="wikilink">Overhead wires</a> were taken into use in the <a href="Mödling_and_Hinterbrühl_Tram" title="wikilink">Mödling and Hinterbrühl Tram</a> in Austria in October 1883. At first, this was taken into use on <a href="tram" title="wikilink">tramways</a> that, until then, had been horse-drawn <a href="tram" title="wikilink">tramcars</a>. The first conventional completely electrified railway mainline was the 106 km <a class="uri" href="Valtellina" title="wikilink">Valtellina</a> line in Italy that was opened on 4 September 1902.</p>

<p>During the 1890s, many large cities, such as <a href="London_Underground" title="wikilink">London</a>, <a href="Paris_Métro" title="wikilink">Paris</a> and <a href="New_York_City_Subway" title="wikilink">New York City</a> used the new technology to build <a href="rapid_transit" title="wikilink">rapid transit</a> for urban commuting. In smaller cities, tramways became common and were often the only mode of <a href="public_transport" title="wikilink">public transport</a> until the introduction of buses in the 1920s. In North America, <a href="interurban" title="wikilink">interurbans</a> became a common mode to reach suburban areas. At first, all electric railways used <a href="direct_current" title="wikilink">direct current</a> but, in 1904, the <a href="Stubaitalbahn" title="wikilink">Stubaital Line</a> in Austria opened with <a href="alternating_current" title="wikilink">alternating current</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p>Steam locomotives require large pools of labour to clean, load, maintain and run. After <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, dramatically increased labour costs in developed countries made steam an increasingly costly form of motive power. At the same time, the war had forced improvements in internal combustion engine technology that made diesel locomotives cheaper and more powerful. This caused many <a href="railway_companies" title="wikilink">railway companies</a> to initiate programmes to convert all unelectrified sections from steam to <a href="diesel_locomotive" title="wikilink">diesel locomotion</a>.</p>

<p>Following the large-scale construction of motorways after the war, rail transport became less popular for commuting and air transport started taking large market shares from long-haul passenger trains. Most tramways were either replaced by rapid transit or buses, while high transshipment costs caused short-haul freight trains to become uncompetitive. The <a href="1973_oil_crisis" title="wikilink">1973 oil crisis</a> led to a change of mind set and most tram systems that had survived into the 1970s remain today. At the same time, <a class="uri" href="containerization" title="wikilink">containerization</a> allowed freight trains to become more competitive and participate in <a href="intermodal_freight_transport" title="wikilink">intermodal freight transport</a>. With the 1964 introduction of the <a class="uri" href="Shinkansen" title="wikilink">Shinkansen</a> <a href="high-speed_rail" title="wikilink">high-speed rail</a> in Japan, trains could again have a dominant position on intercity travel. During the 1970s, the introduction of automated rapid transit systems allowed cheaper operation. The 1990s saw an increased focus on <a class="uri" href="accessibility" title="wikilink">accessibility</a> and low-floor trains. Many tramways have been upgraded to <a href="light_rail" title="wikilink">light rail</a> and many cities that closed their old tramways have reopened new light railway systems.</p>
<h3 id="innovations">Innovations</h3>

<p>Many benchmarks in equipment and infrastructure led to the growing use of railways. Some innovative features taking place in the 19th and 20th centuries included wood cars replaced with all-steel cars, which provided better safety and maintenance; <a class="uri" href="iron" title="wikilink">iron</a> rails replaced with <a class="uri" href="steel" title="wikilink">steel</a> rails, which provided higher speed and capacity with lower weight and cost; stove-heated cars to steam-heating cars, piped from locomotive; <a href="gas_lighting" title="wikilink">gas lighting</a> to <a href="electric_lighting" title="wikilink">electric lighting</a>, with use of <a href="Battery_(electricity)" title="wikilink">battery</a>/<a class="uri" href="alternator" title="wikilink">alternator</a> unit beneath the car; development of <a class="uri" href="air-conditioning" title="wikilink">air-conditioning</a> with additional underbody equipment and ice compartment. Some innovative rolling stock included the lightweight, diesel-powered <a class="uri" href="streamliner" title="wikilink">streamliner</a>, which was a modernistic, aerodynamically styled train with flowing contours; then came the ultra-lightweight car with <a href="internal_combustion_engine" title="wikilink">internal combustion engine</a> in each train's power car; others included the dome car, turbined-powered trains, bi-level rolling stock, and the high-tech/high-speed electric trains.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p>Even more, in the first half of the 20th century, infrastructure elements adopted technological changes including the continuously welded rail that was  long; concrete tie usage; double tracking major lines; <a href="Intermodal_freight_transport" title="wikilink">intermodal</a> terminal and handling technology; advances in diesel-electric propulsion to include <a href="AC_motor" title="wikilink">AC</a> traction systems and propulsion braking systems; and <a href="just-in-time_(business)" title="wikilink">just-in-time</a> inventory control. Beyond technology, even management of systems saw improvements with the adoption of <a href="environmental_impact" title="wikilink">environmental impact</a> concerns; heightened concern of employee and <a href="public_safety" title="wikilink">public safety</a>; introduction of <a href="urban_area" title="wikilink">urban area</a> rail networks and public agencies to manage them; and downsizing of industry employment with greater use of <a class="uri" href="contractors" title="wikilink">contractors</a> and <a class="uri" href="consultants" title="wikilink">consultants</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="trains">Trains</h2>

<p>A train is a connected series of rail vehicles that move along the track. Propulsion for the train is provided by a separate locomotive or from individual motors in self-propelled multiple units. Most trains carry a revenue load, although non-revenue cars exist for the railway's own use, such as for <a class="uri" href="maintenance-of-way" title="wikilink">maintenance-of-way</a> purposes. The <a href="railroad_engineer" title="wikilink">engine driver</a> (engineer in North America) controls the locomotive or other power cars, although <a href="people_mover" title="wikilink">people movers</a> and some rapid transits are under automatic control.</p>
<h3 id="haulage">Haulage</h3>

<p> Traditionally, trains are pulled using a locomotive. This involves one or more powered vehicles being located at the front of the train, providing sufficient <a href="tractive_force" title="wikilink">tractive force</a> to haul the weight of the full train. This arrangement remains dominant for freight trains and is often used for passenger trains. A <a href="push-pull_train" title="wikilink">push-pull train</a> has the end passenger car equipped with a driver's cab so that the engine driver can remotely control the locomotive. This allows one of the locomotive-hauled train's drawbacks to be removed, since the locomotive need not be moved to the front of the train each time the train changes direction. A <a href="railroad_car" title="wikilink">railroad car</a> is a vehicle used for the haulage of either passengers or freight.</p>

<p>A multiple unit has powered wheels throughout the whole train. These are used for rapid transit and tram systems, as well as many both short- and long-haul passenger trains. A <a class="uri" href="railcar" title="wikilink">railcar</a> is a single, self-powered car, and may be electrically-propelled or powered by a <a href="diesel_engine" title="wikilink">diesel engine</a>. Multiple units have a driver's cab at each end of the unit, and were developed following the ability to build <a href="electric_motor" title="wikilink">electric motors</a> and <a href="engine" title="wikilink">engines</a> small enough to fit under the coach. There are only a few freight multiple units, most of which are high-speed post trains.</p>
<h3 id="motive-power">Motive power</h3>

<p> <a href="Steam_locomotive" title="wikilink">Steam locomotives</a> are locomotives with a <a href="steam_engine" title="wikilink">steam engine</a> that provides adhesion. <a class="uri" href="Coal" title="wikilink">Coal</a>, <a class="uri" href="petroleum" title="wikilink">petroleum</a>, or <a class="uri" href="wood" title="wikilink">wood</a> is burned in a <a href="firebox_(steam_engine)" title="wikilink">firebox</a>, boiling water in the <a href="fire-tube_boiler" title="wikilink">boiler</a> to create pressurized steam. The steam travels through the <a class="uri" href="smokebox" title="wikilink">smokebox</a> before leaving via the chimney or smoke stack. In the process, it powers a <a class="uri" href="piston" title="wikilink">piston</a> that transmits power directly through a <a href="connecting_rod" title="wikilink">connecting rod</a> (US: main rod) and a <a class="uri" href="crankpin" title="wikilink">crankpin</a> (US: wristpin) on the <a href="driving_wheel" title="wikilink">driving wheel</a> (US main driver) or to a <a href="crankshaft" title="wikilink">crank</a> on a driving axle. Steam locomotives have been phased out in most parts of the world for economical and safety reasons, although many are preserved in working order by <a href="heritage_railway" title="wikilink">heritage railways</a>.</p>

<p><a href="Electric_locomotive" title="wikilink">Electric locomotives</a> draw power from a stationary source via an <a href="Overhead_lines" title="wikilink">overhead wire</a> or <a href="third_rail" title="wikilink">third rail</a>.

In locomotives that are powered by high voltage <a href="alternating_current" title="wikilink">alternating current</a>, a <a class="uri" href="transformer" title="wikilink">transformer</a> in the locomotive converts the high voltage, low current power to low voltage, high current used in the <a href="electric_motor" title="wikilink">traction motors</a> that power the wheels. Modern locomotives may use <a href="Electric_motor#Three-phase_AC_induction_motors" title="wikilink">three-phase AC induction motors</a> or <a href="direct_current" title="wikilink">direct current</a> motors. Under certain conditions, electric locomotives are the most powerful traction. They are also the cheapest to run and provide less noise and no local air pollution. However, they require high capital investments both for the <a href="overhead_lines" title="wikilink">overhead lines</a> and the supporting infrastructure, as well as the generating station that is needed to produce electricity. Accordingly, electric traction is used on urban systems, lines with high traffic and for high-speed rail.</p>

<h3 id="passenger-trains">Passenger trains</h3>

<p>A passenger train travels between stations where passengers may embark and disembark. The oversight of the train is the duty of a <a href="conductor_(transportation)" title="wikilink">guard/train manager/conductor</a>. Passenger trains are part of public transport and often make up the stem of the service, with buses feeding to stations. Passenger trains provide long-distance intercity travel, daily commuter trips, or local urban transit services. They even include a diversity of vehicles, operating speeds, right-of-way requirements, and service frequency. Passenger trains usually can be divided into two operations: intercity railway and intracity transit. Whereas as intercity railway involve higher speeds, longer routes, and lower frequency (usually scheduled), intracity transit involves lower speeds, shorter routes, and higher frequency (especially during peak hours).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Inter-city_rail" title="wikilink">Intercity trains</a> are long-haul trains that operate with few stops between cities. Trains typically have amenities such as a <a href="dining_car" title="wikilink">dining car</a>. Some lines also provide over-night services with <a href="sleeping_car" title="wikilink">sleeping cars</a>. Some long-haul trains have been given a <a href="lists_of_named_passenger_trains" title="wikilink">specific name</a>. <a href="Regional_rail" title="wikilink">Regional trains</a> are medium distance trains that connect cities with outlying, surrounding areas, or provide a regional service, making more stops and having lower speeds. <a href="Commuter_rail" title="wikilink">Commuter trains</a> serve suburbs of urban areas, providing a daily <a class="uri" href="commuting" title="wikilink">commuting</a> service. <a href="Airport_rail_link" title="wikilink">Airport rail links</a> provide quick access from city centres to <a href="airport" title="wikilink">airports</a>.</p>

<p><a href="High-speed_rail" title="wikilink">High-speed rail</a> are special inter-city trains that operate at much higher speeds than conventional railways, the limit being regarded at . High-speed trains are used mostly for long-haul service and most systems are in Western Europe and East Asia. The <a href="land_speed_record_for_railed_vehicles" title="wikilink">speed record</a> is , set by a modified French <a class="uri" href="TGV" title="wikilink">TGV</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> <a href="Maglev_(transport)" title="wikilink">Magnetic levitation</a> trains such as the Shanghai airport train use under-riding magnets which attract themselves upward towards the underside of a guideway and this line has achieved somewhat higher peak speeds in day-to-day operation than conventional high-speed railways, although only over short distances. Due to their heightened speeds, route alignments for high-speed rail tend to have shallower grades and broader curves than conventional railways.</p>

<p>Their high kinetic energy translates to higher horsepower-to-ton ratios (e.g. ); this allows trains to accelerate and maintain higher speeds and negotiate steep grades as momentum builds up and recovered in downgrades (reducing cut, fill, and tunneling requirements). Since lateral forces act on curves, curvatures are designed with the highest possible radius. All these features are dramatically different from freight operations, thus justifying exclusive high-speed rail lines if it is economically feasible.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> </p>

<p><a href="Higher-speed_rail" title="wikilink">Higher-speed rail</a> services are intercity rail services that have top speeds higher than conventional intercity trains but the speeds are not as high as those in the high-speed rail services. These services are provided after improvements to the conventional rail infrastructure in order to support trains that can operate safely at higher speeds.</p>

<p>High speed railway (High Speed Railroad/Railway &amp; Railroad/Railway high speed) commonly referred to as the High-speed Rail (abbre:HR[hairei]), is a kind of operating speed of at least eighty percent more than in the whole operation process of distance over . As of 2014, the operating speed of High-speed Rail systems in the world are running about all set at , a few systems have relatively high speed. For High-speed Rail speed can be considered:</p>

<p><a href="Rapid_transit" title="wikilink">Rapid transit</a> is an intracity system built in large cities and has the highest capacity of any passenger transport system. It is usually grade-separated and commonly built underground or elevated. At street level, smaller <a href="tram" title="wikilink">trams</a> can be used. <a href="Light_rail" title="wikilink">Light rails</a> are upgraded trams that have step-free access, their own right-of-way and sometimes sections underground. <a class="uri" href="Monorail" title="wikilink">Monorail</a> systems are elevated, medium-capacity systems. A <a href="people_mover" title="wikilink">people mover</a> is a driverless, grade-separated train that serves only a few stations, as a shuttle. Due to the lack of uniformity of rapid transit systems, route alignment varies, with diverse rights-of-way (private land, side of road, street median) and <a href="track_geometry" title="wikilink">geometric characteristics</a> (sharp or broad curves, steep or gentle grades). For instance, the <a href="Chicago_'L'" title="wikilink">Chicago 'L'</a> trains are designed with extremely short cars to negotiate the sharp curves in the <a href="The_Loop_(CTA)" title="wikilink">Loop</a>. New Jersey's <a href="Port_Authority_Trans-Hudson" title="wikilink">PATH</a> has similar-sized cars to accommodate curves in the trans-Hudson tunnels. San Francisco's <a class="uri" href="BART" title="wikilink">BART</a> operates large cars on its well-engineered routes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="freight-train">Freight train</h3>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>Bulk cargo of minerals</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A freight train hauls <a class="uri" href="cargo" title="wikilink">cargo</a> using <a href="goods_wagon" title="wikilink">freight cars</a> specialized for the type of goods. Freight trains are very efficient, with economy of scale and high energy efficiency. However, their use can be reduced by lack of flexibility, if there is need of transshipment at both ends of the trip due to lack of tracks to the points of pick-up and delivery. Authorities often encourage the use of cargo rail transport due to its environmental profile.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Containerization" title="wikilink">Container trains</a> have become the dominant type in the US for non-bulk haulage. Containers can easily be transshipped to other modes, such as ships and trucks, using cranes. This has succeeded the <a class="uri" href="boxcar" title="wikilink">boxcar</a> (wagon-load), where the cargo had to be loaded and unloaded into the train manually. The intermodal <a class="uri" href="containerization" title="wikilink">containerization</a> of cargo has revolutionized the <a href="supply_chain" title="wikilink">supply chain</a> <a class="uri" href="logistics" title="wikilink">logistics</a> industry, reducing ship costs significantly. In Europe, the <a href="Goods_van#Sliding_wall_wagons" title="wikilink">sliding wall wagon</a> has largely superseded the <a href="Goods_van" title="wikilink">ordinary covered wagons</a>. Other types of cars include <a href="refrigerator_car" title="wikilink">refrigerator cars</a>, <a href="stock_car_(rail)" title="wikilink">stock cars</a> for livestock and <a href="autorack" title="wikilink">autoracks</a> for road vehicles. When rail is combined with road transport, a <a class="uri" href="roadrailer" title="wikilink">roadrailer</a> will allow <a href="semi-trailer" title="wikilink">trailers</a> to be driven onto the train, allowing for easy transition between road and rail.</p>

<p><a href="Bulk_material_handling" title="wikilink">Bulk handling</a> represents a key advantage for rail transport. Low or even zero transshipment costs combined with energy efficiency and low inventory costs allow trains to handle <a href="bulk_cargo" title="wikilink">bulk</a> much cheaper than by road. Typical bulk cargo includes coal, ore, grains and liquids. Bulk is transported in <a href="gondola_(rail)" title="wikilink">open-topped cars</a>, <a href="hopper_car" title="wikilink">hopper cars</a> and <a href="tank_car" title="wikilink">tank cars</a>.</p>
<h2 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h2>
<h3 id="right-of-way">Right of way</h3>

<p>Railway tracks are laid upon land owned or leased by the railway company. Owing to the desirability of maintaining modest grades, rails will often be laid in circuitous routes in hilly or mountainous terrain. Route length and grade requirements can be reduced by the use of alternating <a href="cutting_(transportation)" title="wikilink">cuttings</a>, bridges and tunnels—all of which can greatly increase the capital expenditures required to develop a right of way, while significantly reducing operating costs and allowing higher speeds on longer radius curves. In densely urbanized areas, railways are sometimes laid in tunnels to minimize the effects on existing properties..</p>
<h3 id="trackage">Trackage</h3>

<p>  Track consists of two parallel steel rails, anchored <a class="uri" href="perpendicular" title="wikilink">perpendicular</a> to members called <a href="railroad_tie" title="wikilink">ties</a> (sleepers) of timber, concrete, steel, or plastic to maintain a consistent distance apart, or <a href="rail_gauge" title="wikilink">rail gauge</a>. Rail gauges are usually categorised as <a href="Standard_gauge" title="wikilink">Standard gauge</a> () used on approximately 60% of the world's existing railway lines, <a href="Broad_gauge" title="wikilink">Broad gauge</a> and <a href="Narrow_gauge" title="wikilink">Narrow gauge</a>. In addition to the rail gauge, the tracks will be laid to conform with a <a href="Loading_gauge" title="wikilink">Loading gauge</a> which defines the maximum height and width for railway vehicles and their loads to ensure safe passage through bridges, tunnels and other structures.</p>

<p>The track guides the conical, flanged wheels, keeping the cars on the track without active steering and therefore allowing trains to be much longer than road vehicles. The rails and ties are usually placed on a foundation made of compressed earth on top of which is placed a bed of <a href="track_ballast" title="wikilink">ballast</a> to distribute the load from the ties and to prevent the track from <a class="uri" href="buckling" title="wikilink">buckling</a> as the ground settles over time under the weight of the vehicles passing above.</p>

<p>The ballast also serves as a means of drainage. Some more modern track in special areas is attached by <a href="direct_fixation" title="wikilink">direct fixation</a> without ballast. Track may be prefabricated or assembled in place. By <a href="Thermite_welding" title="wikilink">welding</a> rails together to form lengths of <a href="continuous_welded_rail" title="wikilink">continuous welded rail</a>, additional wear and tear on rolling stock caused by the small surface gap at the joints between rails can be counteracted; this also makes for a quieter ride (passenger trains).</p>

<p>On curves the outer rail may be at a higher level than the inner rail. This is called superelevation or <a href="cant_(road/rail)" title="wikilink">cant</a>. This reduces the forces tending to displace the track and makes for a more comfortable ride for standing livestock and standing or seated passengers. A given amount of superelevation will be the most effective over a limited range of speeds.</p>

<p><a href="Railroad_switch" title="wikilink">Turnouts</a>, also known as points and switches, are the means of directing a train onto a diverging section of track. Laid similar to normal track, a point typically consists of a <a href="Switch_frog" title="wikilink">frog</a> (common crossing), check rails and two switch rails. The switch rails may be moved left or right, under the control of the signalling system, to determine which path the train will follow.</p>

<p>Spikes in wooden ties can loosen over time, but split and rotten ties may be individually replaced with new wooden ties or concrete substitutes. Concrete ties can also develop cracks or splits, and can also be replaced individually. Should the rails settle due to soil subsidence, they can be lifted by specialized machinery and additional ballast tamped under the ties to level the rails.</p>

<p>Periodically, ballast must be removed and replaced with clean ballast to ensure adequate drainage. Culverts and other passages for water must be kept clear lest water is impounded by the trackbed, causing landslips. Where trackbeds are placed along rivers, additional protection is usually placed to prevent streambank erosion during times of high water. Bridges require inspection and maintenance, since they are subject to large surges of stress in a short period of time when a heavy train crosses.</p>
<h3 id="train-inspection-systems">Train inspection systems</h3>

<p>The inspection of railway equipment is essential for the safe movement of trains. Many types of <a href="defect_detector" title="wikilink">defect detectors</a> are in use on the world's railroads. These devices utilize technologies that vary from a simplistic paddle and switch to <a class="uri" href="infrared" title="wikilink">infrared</a> and laser scanning, and even <a href="Ultrasonic_testing" title="wikilink">ultrasonic audio analysis</a>. Their use has avoided many rail accidents over the 70 years they have been used.</p>
<h3 id="signalling">Signalling</h3>

<p> Railway signalling is a system used to control railway traffic safely to prevent trains from colliding. Being guided by fixed <a href="Track_(rail_transport)" title="wikilink">rails</a> with low friction, trains are uniquely susceptible to collision since they frequently operate at speeds that do not enable them to stop quickly or within the driver's sighting distance. Most forms of train control involve movement authority being passed from those responsible for each section of a rail network to the train crew. Not all methods require the use of signals, and some systems are specific to <a href="single_track_(rail)" title="wikilink">single track</a> railways.</p>

<p>The signalling process is traditionally carried out in a <a href="signal_box" title="wikilink">signal box</a>, a small building that houses the <a href="lever_frame" title="wikilink">lever frame</a> required for the signalman to operate switches and signal equipment. These are placed at various intervals along the route of a railway, controlling specified sections of track. More recent technological developments have made such operational doctrine superfluous, with the centralization of signalling operations to regional control rooms. This has been facilitated by the increased use of computers, allowing vast sections of track to be monitored from a single location. The common method of <a href="Railway_signalling#Blocks" title="wikilink">block signalling</a> divides the track into zones guarded by combinations of block signals, operating rules, and automatic-control devices so that only one train may be in a block at any time.</p>
<h3 id="electrification">Electrification</h3>

<p>The electrification system provides electrical energy to the trains, so they can operate without a prime mover on board. This allows lower operating costs, but requires large capital investments along the lines. Mainline and tram systems normally have overhead wires, which hang from poles along the line. Grade-separated rapid transit sometimes use a ground <a href="third_rail" title="wikilink">third rail</a>.</p>

<p>Power may be fed as <a href="direct_current" title="wikilink">direct</a> or <a href="alternating_current" title="wikilink">alternating current</a>. The most common DC voltages are 600 and 750 V for tram and rapid transit systems, and 1,500  and 3,000 V for mainlines. The two dominant AC systems are <a href="15_kV_AC_railway_electrification" title="wikilink">15 kV AC</a> and <a href="25_kV_AC_railway_electrification" title="wikilink">25 kV AC</a>.</p>
<h3 id="stations">Stations</h3>

<p> A <a href="railway_station" title="wikilink">railway station</a> serves as an area where passengers can board and alight from trains. A <a href="goods_station" title="wikilink">goods station</a> is a yard which is exclusively used for loading and unloading cargo. Large passenger stations have at least one building providing conveniences for passengers, such as purchasing tickets and food. Smaller stations typically only consist of a <a href="railway_platform" title="wikilink">platform</a>. Early stations were sometimes built with both passenger and goods facilities.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>Platforms are used to allow easy access to the trains, and are connected to each other via <a href="underpass" title="wikilink">underpasses</a>, <a href="footbridge" title="wikilink">footbridges</a> and level crossings. Some large stations are built as <a href="cul-de-sac" title="wikilink">culs-de-sac</a>, with trains only operating out from one direction. Smaller stations normally serve local residential areas, and may have connection to feeder bus services. Large stations, in particular <a href="central_station" title="wikilink">central stations</a>, serve as the main <a href="transport_hub" title="wikilink">public transport hub</a> for the city, and have transfer available between rail services, and to rapid transit, tram or bus services.</p>
<h2 id="operations">Operations</h2>
<h3 id="ownership">Ownership</h3>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>In the United States, railroads such as the <a href="Union_Pacific" title="wikilink">Union Pacific</a> traditionally own and operate both their rolling stock and infrastructure, with the company itself typically being privately owned.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Since the 1980s, there has been an increasing trend to split up railway companies, with companies owning the rolling stock separated from those owning the infrastructure. This is particularly true in Europe, where this arrangement is required by the European Union. This has allowed open access by any train operator to any portion of the European railway network. This is different in the UK however, where the railway track is state owned, with a public controlled body (<a href="Network_Rail" title="wikilink">Network Rail</a>) running, maintaining and developing the track.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p>In the U.S., virtually all rail networks and infrastructure outside the <a href="Northeast_corridor" title="wikilink">Northeast Corridor</a> are privately owned by freight lines. Passenger lines, primarily <a class="uri" href="Amtrak" title="wikilink">Amtrak</a>, operate as tenants on the freight lines. Consequently, operations must be closely synchronized and coordinated between freight and passenger railroads, with passenger trains often being dispatched by the host freight railroad. Due to this shared system, both are regulated by the <a href="Federal_Railroad_Administration" title="wikilink">Federal Railroad Administration</a> (FRA) and may follow the <a href="American_Railway_Engineering_and_Maintenance-of-Way_Association" title="wikilink">AREMA</a> recommended practices for track work and <a href="Association_of_American_Railroads" title="wikilink">AAR</a> standards for vehicles.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="financing">Financing</h3>

<p>The main source of income for railway companies is from <a href="train_ticket" title="wikilink">ticket</a> revenue (for passenger transport) and shipment fees for cargo. Discounts and monthly passes are sometimes available for frequent travellers (e.g. <a href="season_ticket" title="wikilink">season ticket</a> and <a href="rail_pass" title="wikilink">rail pass</a>). Freight revenue may be sold per container slot or for a whole train. Sometimes, the shipper owns the cars and only rents the haulage. For passenger transport, <a class="uri" href="advertisement" title="wikilink">advertisement</a> income can be significant.</p>

<p>Governments may choose to give subsidies to rail operation, since rail transport has fewer <a class="uri" href="externalities" title="wikilink">externalities</a> than other dominant modes of transport. If the railway company is state-owned, the state may simply provide direct subsidies in exchange for increased production. If operations have been privatized, several options are available. Some countries have a system where the infrastructure is owned by a government agency or company—with open access to the tracks for any company that meets safety requirements. In such cases, the state may choose to provide the tracks free of charge, or for a fee that does not cover all costs. This is seen as analogous to the government providing free access to roads. For passenger operations, a direct subsidy may be paid to a public-owned operator, or <a href="public_service_obligation" title="wikilink">public service obligation</a> tender may be helt, and a time-limited contract awarded to the lowest bidder.</p>

<p><a class="uri" href="Amtrak" title="wikilink">Amtrak</a>, the US passenger rail service, and Canada's <a href="Via_Rail" title="wikilink">Via Rail</a> are private railroad companies chartered by their respective national governments. As private passenger services declined because of competition from automobiles and airlines, they became <a href="shareholder" title="wikilink">shareholders</a> of Amtrak either with a cash entrance fee or relinquishing their locomotives and rolling stock. The government subsidizes Amtrak by supplying start-up <a href="capital_(economics)" title="wikilink">capital</a> and making up for losses at the end of the <a href="fiscal_year" title="wikilink">fiscal year</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="safety">Safety</h3>

<p> Trains can travel at very high speed, but they are heavy, are unable to deviate from the track and require a great distance to stop. Possible accidents include <a class="uri" href="derailment" title="wikilink">derailment</a> (jumping the track), a collision with another train or collision with automobiles, other vehicles or pedestrians at <a href="level_crossing" title="wikilink">level crossings</a>. The last accounts for the majority of rail accidents and casualties. The most important safety measures to prevent accidents are strict operating rules, e.g. <a href="railway_signalling" title="wikilink">railway signalling</a> and gates or <a href="grade_separation" title="wikilink">grade separation</a> at crossings. <a href="Train_whistle" title="wikilink">Train whistles</a>, bells or horns warn of the presence of a train, while trackside signals maintain the distances between trains.</p>

<p>An important element in the safety of many high-speed inter-city networks such as Japan's <a class="uri" href="Shinkansen" title="wikilink">Shinkansen</a> is the fact that trains only run on dedicated railway lines, without level crossings. This effectively eliminates the potential for collision with automobiles, other vehicles or pedestrians, vastly reduces the likelihood of collision with other trains and helps ensure services remain timely.</p>
<h3 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h3>

<p>As in any <a class="uri" href="infrastructure" title="wikilink">infrastructure</a> asset, railways must keep up with periodic inspection and maintenance in order to minimize effect of infrastructure failures that can disrupt freight revenue operations and passenger services. Because passengers are considered the most <em>crucial cargo</em> and usually operate at higher speeds, steeper grades, and higher capacity/frequency, their lines are especially important. Inspection practices include <a href="track_geometry_car" title="wikilink">track geometry cars</a> or walking inspection. Curve maintenance especially for transit services includes gauging, fastener tightening, and rail replacement.</p>

<p>Rail corrugation is a common issue with transit systems due to the high number of light-axle, wheel passages which result in grinding of the wheel/rail interface. Since maintenance may overlap with operations, maintenance windows (nighttime hours, <a class="uri" href="off-peak" title="wikilink">off-peak</a> hours, altering train schedules or routes) must be closely followed. In addition, passenger safety during maintenance work (inter-track fencing, proper storage of materials, track work notices, hazards of equipment near states) must be regarded at all times. At times, maintenance access problems can emerge due to tunnels, elevated structures, and congested cityscapes. Here, specialized equipment or smaller versions of conventional maintenance gear are used.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>Unlike <a class="uri" href="highways" title="wikilink">highways</a> or <a href="road_network" title="wikilink">road networks</a> where capacity is disaggregated into unlinked trips over individual route segments, railway capacity is fundamentally considered a network system. As a result, many components are causes and effects of system disruptions. Maintenance must acknowledge the vast array of a route's performance (type of train service, origination/destination, seasonal impacts), line's capacity (length, terrain, number of tracks, types of train control), trains throughput (max speeds, acceleration/deceleration rates), and service features with shared passenger-freight tracks (sidings, terminal capacities, switching routes, and design type).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<p>where:</p>
<dl>
<dd><em>R</em> denotes total resistance
</dd>
<dd><em>a</em> denotes initial constant resistance
</dd>
<dd><em>b</em> denotes velocity-related constant
</dd>
<dd><em>c</em> denotes constant that is function of shape, frontal area, and sides of vehicle
</dd>
<dd><em>v</em> denotes velocity
</dd>
<dd><em>v</em><sup>2</sup> denotes velocity, squared<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Essentially, resistance differs between vehicle's contact point and surface of roadway. Metal wheels on metal rails have a significant advantage of overcoming resistance compared to rubber-tired wheels on any road surface (railway – 0.001g at  and 0.024g at ; truck – 0.009g at  and 0.090 at ). In terms of cargo capacity combining speed and size being moved in a day:</p>
<ul>
<li>human – can carry  for  per day, or 1 <a href="Units_of_transportation_measurement#Payload-Distance" title="wikilink">tmi</a>/day (1.5 <a href="Units_of_transportation_measurement#Payload-Distance" title="wikilink">tkm</a>/day)</li>
<li>horse and wheelbarrow – can carry 4 tmi/day (5.8 tkm/day)</li>
<li>horse cart on good pavement – can carry 10 tmi/day (14 tkm/day)</li>
<li>fully utility truck – can carry 20,000 tmi/day (29,000 tkm/day) </li>
<li>long-haul train – can carry 500,000 tmi/day (730,000 tkm/day)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Most trains take 250–400 trucks off the road, thus making the road more safe.</li>
</ul>

<p>In terms of the horsepower to weight ratio, a slow-moving barge requires , a railway and pipeline requires , and truck requires . However, at higher speeds, a railway overcomes the barge and proves most economical.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>

<p>As an example, a typical modern wagon can hold up to  of freight on two four-wheel <a href="bogie" title="wikilink">bogies</a>. The track distributes the weight of the train evenly, allowing significantly greater loads per <a class="uri" href="axle" title="wikilink">axle</a> and wheel than in road transport, leading to less wear and tear on the permanent way. This can save energy compared with other forms of transport, such as road transport, which depends on the friction between rubber tires and the road. Trains have a small frontal area in relation to the load they are carrying, which reduces <a href="air_resistance" title="wikilink">air resistance</a> and thus energy usage.</p>

<p>In addition, the presence of track guiding the wheels allows for very long trains to be pulled by one or a few engines and driven by a single operator, even around curves, which allows for <a href="economies_of_scale" title="wikilink">economies of scale</a> in both manpower and energy use; by contrast, in road transport, more than two <a href="Articulated_vehicle" title="wikilink">articulations</a> causes <a class="uri" href="fishtailing" title="wikilink">fishtailing</a> and makes the vehicle unsafe.</p>
<h4 id="energy-efficiency">Energy efficiency</h4>

<p>Considering only the energy spent to move the means of transport, and using the example of the urban area of <a class="uri" href="Lisbon" title="wikilink">Lisbon</a>, trains seem to be on average 20 times more efficient than automobiles for transportation of passengers, if we consider energy spent per passenger-distance with similar occupation ratios.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Considering an automobile with a consumption of around  of gasoline, the average car in Europe has an occupancy of around 1.2 passengers per automobile (occupation ratio around 24%) and that <a href="Fuel_efficiency" title="wikilink">one litre of gasoline</a> amounts to about , equating to an average of  per passenger-km. This compares to a modern train with an average occupancy of 20% and a consumption of about , equating to  per passenger-km, 20 times less than the automobile.</p>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>

<p>Due to these benefits, rail transport is a major form of passenger and freight transport in many countries. It is ubiquitous in Europe, with an integrated network covering virtually the whole continent. In India, China, South Korea and Japan, many millions use trains as regular transport. In North America, freight rail transport is widespread and heavily used, but intercity passenger rail transport is relatively scarce outside the <a href="Northeast_Corridor" title="wikilink">Northeast Corridor</a>, due to increased preference of other modes, particularly automobiles and airplanes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a>   South Africa, northern Africa and Argentina have extensive rail networks, but some railways elsewhere in Africa and South America are isolated lines. Australia has a generally sparse network befitting its population density but has some areas with significant networks, especially in the southeast. In addition to the previously existing east-west transcontinental line in Australia, a line from north to south has been constructed. The highest railway in the world is the <a href="Qingzang_railway" title="wikilink">line to Lhasa</a>, in Tibet,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> partly running over permafrost territory. Western Europe has the highest railway density in the world and many individual trains there operate through several countries despite technical and organizational differences in each national network.</p>
<h3 id="social-and-economic-benefits">Social and economic benefits</h3>

<p> Railways are central to the formation of modernity and ideas of progress.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Railways contribute to social vibrancy and economic competitiveness by transporting multitudes of customers and workers to <a href="city_centre" title="wikilink">city centres</a> and <a href="inner_suburbs" title="wikilink">inner suburbs</a>. <a href="Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Hong Kong</a> has recognized rail as "the backbone of the <a href="public_transit_system" title="wikilink">public transit system</a>" and as such developed their franchised bus system and road infrastructure in comprehensive alignment with their rail services.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> China's large cities such as <a class="uri" href="Beijing" title="wikilink">Beijing</a>, <a class="uri" href="Shanghai" title="wikilink">Shanghai</a>, and <a class="uri" href="Guangzhou" title="wikilink">Guangzhou</a> recognize rail transit lines as the framework and bus lines as the main body to their metropolitan transportation systems.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The Japanese <a class="uri" href="Shinkansen" title="wikilink">Shinkansen</a> was built to meet the growing traffic demand in the "heart of Japan's industry and economy" situated on the <a class="uri" href="Tokyo" title="wikilink">Tokyo</a>-<a class="uri" href="Kobe" title="wikilink">Kobe</a> line.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>

<p> During much of the 20th Century, rail was an invaluable element of military <a class="uri" href="mobilization" title="wikilink">mobilization</a>, allowing for the quick and efficient transport of large numbers of reservists to their mustering-points, and infantry soldiers to the front lines. However, by the 21st Century, rail transport - limited to locations on the same continent, and vulnerable to air attack - had largely been displaced by the adoption of <a href="Airlift" title="wikilink">aerial transport</a>.</p>

<p>Railways channel growth toward dense city <a class="uri" href="agglomerations" title="wikilink">agglomerations</a> and along their arteries, as opposed to <a class="uri" href="highway" title="wikilink">highway</a> expansion, indicative of the U.S. transportation policy, which incents development of <a class="uri" href="suburbs" title="wikilink">suburbs</a> at the periphery, contributing to increased <a href="vehicle_miles_traveled" title="wikilink">vehicle miles traveled</a>, <a href="carbon_emissions" title="wikilink">carbon emissions</a>, development of <a href="greenfield_land" title="wikilink">greenfield</a> spaces, and depletion of <a href="natural_reserve" title="wikilink">natural reserves</a>. These arrangements revalue city spaces, local <a class="uri" href="taxes" title="wikilink">taxes</a>, <a href="house" title="wikilink">housing</a> values, and promotion of <a href="mixed_use_development" title="wikilink">mixed use development</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="modern-rail-as-economic-development-indicator">Modern rail as economic development indicator</h3>

<p>European <a href="development_economist" title="wikilink">development economists</a> have argued that the existence of modern rail infrastructure is a significant indicator of a country's economic advancement: this perspective is illustrated notably through the <a href="Basic_Rail_Transportation_Infrastructure_Index" title="wikilink">Basic Rail Transportation Infrastructure Index</a> (known as BRTI Index)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
