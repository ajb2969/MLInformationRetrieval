<h1>Brams–Taylor–Zwicker procedure</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>Brams–Taylor–Zwicker procedure</strong> is a protocol for <a href="envy-free_division" title="wikilink">envy-free division</a> of a cake between 4 people.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The procedure uses a variation of <a href="Austin_moving-knife_procedure#Two_partners_and_general_fractions" title="wikilink">Austin's procedure for two partners and general fractions</a>. That procedure allows two partners to divide an entire cake to

 pieces, each of which is worth exactly

 for both of them.</p>

<p>The main procedure works as follows.</p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> Use Austin's procedure with 

<math display="inline" id="Brams–Taylor–Zwicker_procedure:2">
 <semantics>
  <mrow>
   <mi>k</mi>
   <mo>=</mo>
   <mn>4</mn>

 and partners #1 and #2. So we have 4 pieces that the first two partners believe to be of exactly identical value of 1/4.</p>

<p><strong>B.</strong> Partner #3 trims one piece to create a two-way tie for the largest; the partners now choose pieces in reverse order (#4, #3, #2, #1). Either #4 or #3 must take the trimmed piece. This creates an envy-free division for the entire cake less the trimmings (This is similar to the <a href="Selfridge–Conway_discrete_procedure" title="wikilink">Selfridge–Conway discrete procedure</a>).</p>

<p><strong>C.</strong> Now the trimmings are divided. Assume w.l.o.g. that #3 took the trimmed piece. We use Austin's procedure again with the trimmings and partners #4 and #1, to create 4 pieces each of which equals exactly 1/4 for both of them. Since partners #1 and #2 have an irrevocable advantage over whoever partner that took the trimmed piece, we can let #3 be the first to select a piece from the trimming, then #2, then #4 and #1.</p>
<h2 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h2>

<p>The run-time of the procedure is, technically, infinite, since Austin's procedure involves two knives moving continuously, and this procedure cannot be discretized.</p>

<p>The number of cuts is bounded, though. Austin's procedure requires 2 cuts to divide a cake between 2 people with an exact value of 1/2; each of these pieces should be divided with 2 more cuts to generate the 4 pieces with exact value of 1/4. So in total, 6 cuts are needed for step A. A single cut is done in step B and 6 more cuts in step C, for a total of 13 cuts.</p>

<p>An advanced variant of the Brams–Taylor–Zwicker procedure uses only 11 cuts.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
