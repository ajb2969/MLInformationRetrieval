It was founded (at the same time as the <a href="Savilian_Professor_of_Astronomy" title="wikilink">Savilian Professorship of Astronomy</a>) by <a href="Henry_Savile_(Bible_translator)" title="wikilink">Sir Henry Savile</a>, a mathematician and <a href="classics" title="wikilink">classical scholar</a> who was <a href="Warden_of_Merton_College,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Warden of Merton College, Oxford</a>, and <a href="Provost_of_Eton_College" title="wikilink">Provost of Eton College</a>, reacting to what has been described by one 20th-century mathematician as "the wretched state of mathematical studies in England" at that time.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> He appointed <a href="Henry_Briggs_(mathematician)" title="wikilink">Henry Briggs</a> as the first professor. <a href="Edward_Charles_Titchmarsh" title="wikilink">Edward Titchmarsh</a> (professor 1931–63) said when applying that he was not prepared to lecture on geometry, and the requirement was removed from the duties of the post to enable his appointment, although the title of the chair was not changed. The two Savilian chairs have been linked with professorial <a href="Oxbridge_Fellow" title="wikilink">fellowships</a> at <a href="New_College,_Oxford" title="wikilink">New College, Oxford</a> since the late 19th century.

<p>There have been 19 professors; <a href="Nigel_Hitchin" title="wikilink">Nigel Hitchin</a>, the current holder of the chair (), was appointed in 1997.

<h2 id="appointment">Appointment</h2>

<p>Savile's first choice for the professorship of geometry was <a href="Edmund_Gunter" title="wikilink">Edmund Gunter</a>, <a href="Gresham_Professor_of_Astronomy" title="wikilink">Professor of Astronomy</a> at <a href="Gresham_College" title="wikilink">Gresham College</a>, London. It was reported that Gunter demonstrated the use of his <a href="sector_(instrument)" title="wikilink">sector</a> and <a href="quadrant_(instrument)" title="wikilink">quadrant</a>, but Savile regarded this as "showing of tricks" rather than geometry, and instead appointed <a href="Henry_Briggs_(mathematician)" title="wikilink">Henry Briggs</a>, the <a href="Gresham_Professor_of_Geometry" title="wikilink">Gresham Professor of Geometry</a>, in 1619.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Briggs took up the chair in 1620 at an annual salary of £150<mtpl>{{#tag:ref|In 2013 terms (the last year for which updating figures are available ), £150 in 1620 would be equivalent to about £27,290 updated for inflation using the <a href="Retail_Price_Index" title="wikilink">Retail Price Index</a> or about £5,345,000 updated to represent an equivalent share of <a href="gross_domestic_product" title="wikilink">gross domestic product</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>|group="n"}}</mtpl> and thus became the first person to hold the first two mathematical chairs established in Britain.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>Savile reserved to himself the right to appoint the professors during his lifetime. After his death, he provided that vacancies should be filled by a majority of a group of "most distinguished persons":<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> the <a href="Archbishop_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, the <a href="Lord_Chancellor" title="wikilink">Lord Chancellor</a>, the <a href="Chancellor_of_the_University_of_Oxford" title="wikilink">Chancellor</a> of the university, the <a href="Bishop_of_London" title="wikilink">Bishop of London</a>, the <a href="Secretary_of_State_(England)" title="wikilink">Secretary of State</a>, the <a href="Chief_Justice_of_the_Common_Pleas" title="wikilink">Chief Justice of the Common Pleas</a>, the <a href="Chief_Justice_of_the_King's_Bench" title="wikilink">Chief Justice of the King's Bench</a>, the <a href="Chief_Baron_of_the_Exchequer" title="wikilink">Chief Baron of the Exchequer</a> and the <a href="Dean_of_Arches" title="wikilink">Dean of the Court of Arches</a>. The <a href="Vice-Chancellor_of_the_University_of_Oxford" title="wikilink">Vice-Chancellor</a> of the university was to inform the electors of any vacancy, and could be summoned to advise them. The appointment could either be made straight away, or delayed for some months to see whether "any eminent mathematician can be allured" from abroad.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>As part of reforms of the university in the 19th century, the University of Oxford commissioners laid down new statutes for the chair in 1881. The professor was to "lecture and give instruction in pure and analytical Geometry", and was to be a <a href="Oxbridge_Fellow" title="wikilink">Fellow</a> of <a href="New_College,_Oxford" title="wikilink">New College</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The electors for the professorship were to be the Warden of New College (or a person nominated by the college in his place), the <a href="Chancellor_of_the_University_of_Oxford" title="wikilink">Chancellor of the University of Oxford</a>, the President of the <a href="Royal_Society" title="wikilink">Royal Society</a>, the <a href="Sedleian_Professor_of_Natural_Philosophy" title="wikilink">Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy</a> at Oxford, the <a href="Sadleirian_Professor_of_Pure_Mathematics" title="wikilink">Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathematics</a> at the <a href="University_of_Cambridge" title="wikilink">University of Cambridge</a>, a person nominated by the university council and one other nominated by New College.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> <a href="Edward_Charles_Titchmarsh" title="wikilink">Edward Titchmarsh</a> (professor from 1931 to 1963) said when applying that he was not prepared to lecture on geometry, and the requirement was removed from the duties of the professor to enable his appointment, although the title of the chair was not changed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Changes to the university's internal legislation in the 20th and early 21st centuries abolished specific statutes for the duties of, and rules for appointment to, individual chairs such as the Savilian professorships. The University Council is now empowered to make appropriate arrangements for appointments and conditions of service, with the college to which any professorship is allocated (New College in the case of the Savilian chairs) to have two representatives on the board of electors.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="professors-house">Professors' house</h2>

<p> <a href="John_Wallis" title="wikilink">John Wallis</a> (professor 1649–1703) rented a house from New College on <a href="New_College_Lane" title="wikilink">New College Lane</a> from 1672 until his death in 1703; at some point, it was divided into two houses. Towards the end of his life, <a href="David_Gregory_(mathematician)" title="wikilink">David Gregory</a> (the Savilian Professor of Astronomy) lived in the eastern part of the premises: although no lease between Wallis and Gregory survives (if one was ever made between the two friends), Gregory's name appears for the first time in the parish rate-book of 1701. Wallis's son gave the unexpired portion of the lease to the university in 1704 in honour of his father's long tenure of the chair, to provide official residences for the two Savilian professors. New College renewed the lease at a low rent from 1716 and thereafter at intervals until the last renewal in 1814. Records of who lived in each house are not available throughout the period, but surviving documentation shows that the professors often sub-let the houses and for about twenty years in the early 18th century the premises were being used as a lodging house. <a href="Stephen_Peter_Rigaud" title="wikilink">Stephen Rigaud</a> lived there from 1810 until he became the astronomy professor in 1827; thereafter, <a href="Baden_Powell_(mathematician)" title="wikilink">Baden Powell</a> lived there with his family. The geometry professors were associated with the houses for longer than the astronomy professors: when the <a href="Radcliffe_Observatory" title="wikilink">Radcliffe Observatory</a> was built in the 1770s, the post of Radcliffe Observer was coupled to the astronomy professorship, and they were provided with a house in that role; thereafter, the university sublet the astronomy professor's house itself. In the early 19th century, New College decided that it wished to use the properties for itself and the lease expired in 1854.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> </p>

<p>Briggs was a lecturer in mathematics and in physic (medicine) at Cambridge, also becoming the first professor of geometry at <a href="Gresham_College" title="wikilink">Gresham College</a>, London, in 1597. He had become acquainted with the principles of <a href="Napier's_logarithm" title="wikilink">Napier's logarithm</a> by 1615: logarithms aided the calculations of astronomy and navigation that were carried out at Gresham since they allowed multiplication of multi-digit numbers to be carried out through the addition of their logarithms. The innovation that Briggs suggested to Napier was to use steps of 10 (the <a href="common_logarithm" title="wikilink">common logarithm</a>). After two visits by Briggs to <a href="John_Napier" title="wikilink">John Napier</a> in Edinburgh, they agreed a redefinition of the logarithm process, but Napier wrote in 1617 that the calculations would have to be carried out by others, including Briggs, because of his own ill health. Briggs is regarded as having created "one of the most useful systems for mathematics".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In 1624, his main work, <em>Arithmetica logarithmica</em>, was published with calculations of the logarithms of 1 to 20,000 and 90,001 to 100,000 to fourteen decimal places. He died in Merton in 1631 and was buried in the choir of <a href="Merton_College_Chapel" title="wikilink">Merton College chapel</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p></td>
