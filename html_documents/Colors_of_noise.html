<h1>Colors of noise</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a href="audio_engineering" title="wikilink">audio engineering</a>, <a class="uri" href="electronics" title="wikilink">electronics</a>, <a class="uri" href="physics" title="wikilink">physics</a>, and many other fields, the <strong>color</strong> of a <a href="noise_(signal_processing)" title="wikilink">noise signal</a> (a signal produced by a <a href="stochastic_process" title="wikilink">stochastic process</a>) is generally understood to be some broad characteristic of its <a href="power_spectrum" title="wikilink">power spectrum</a>. Different colors of noise have significantly different properties: for example, as <a href="audio_signal" title="wikilink">audio signals</a> they will sound differently to <a href="hearing_(sense)" title="wikilink">human ears</a>, and as <a href="digital_image" title="wikilink">images</a> they will have a visibly different <a href="texture_(visual_arts)" title="wikilink">texture</a>. Therefore, each application typically requires noise of a specific color. This sense of 'color' for noise signals is similar to the concept of <a class="uri" href="timbre" title="wikilink">timbre</a> in <a class="uri" href="music" title="wikilink">music</a> (which is also called "tone color"); however the latter is almost always used for <a class="uri" href="sound" title="wikilink">sound</a>, and may consider very detailed features of the <a class="uri" href="spectrum" title="wikilink">spectrum</a>.</p>

<p>The practice of naming kinds of noise after colors started with <a href="white_noise" title="wikilink">white noise</a>, a signal whose spectrum has equal <a href="power_(physics)" title="wikilink">power</a> within any equal interval of frequencies. That name was given by analogy with white light, which was (incorrectly) assumed to have such a flat power spectrum over the visible range. Other color names, like <em>pink</em>, <em>red</em>, and <em>blue</em> were then given to noise with other spectral profiles, often (but not always) in reference to the color of light with similar spectra. Some of those names have standard definitions in certain disciplines, while others are very informal and poorly defined. Many of these definitions assume a signal with components at all frequencies, with a power spectral density per unit of bandwidth proportional to 1/<em>f</em> <sup><em>β</em></sup> and hence they are examples of <em>power-law noise</em>. For instance, the spectral density of <a href="white_noise" title="wikilink">white noise</a> is flat (<em>β</em> = 0), while <a href="flicker_noise" title="wikilink">flicker</a> or <a href="pink_noise" title="wikilink">pink noise</a> has <em>β</em> = 1, and <a href="brown_noise" title="wikilink">brown noise</a> has <em>β</em> = 2.</p>

<p>:</p>
<h2 id="technical-definitions">Technical definitions</h2>

<p>Various noise models are employed in analysis, many of which fall under the above categories. <a href="AR_noise" title="wikilink">AR noise</a> or "autoregressive noise" is such a model, and generates simple examples of the above noise types, and more. The <a href="Federal_Standard_1037C" title="wikilink">Federal Standard 1037C</a> Telecommunications Glossary defines white, pink, blue, and black.</p>

<p>The color names for these different types of sounds are derived from a loose analogy between the spectrum of frequencies of sound wave present in the sound (as shown in the blue diagrams) and the equivalent spectrum of light wave frequencies. That is, if the sound wave pattern of "blue noise" were translated into light waves, the resulting light would be blue, and so on.</p>

<p><a href="White_noise" title="wikilink">White noise</a> is a <a href="Signal_(electrical_engineering)" title="wikilink">signal</a> (or process), named by analogy to <a href="Electromagnetic_spectrum#Visible_radiation_.28light.29" title="wikilink">white light</a>, with a flat <a href="frequency_spectrum" title="wikilink">frequency spectrum</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> when plotted as a linear function of frequency (e.g., in Hz). In other words, the signal has equal <a href="power_(physics)" title="wikilink">power</a> in any band of a given <a href="Bandwidth_(signal_processing)" title="wikilink">bandwidth</a> (<a href="power_spectral_density" title="wikilink">power spectral density</a>) when the bandwidth is measured in <a href="hertz" title="wikilink">Hz</a>. For example, with a white noise audio signal, the range of frequencies between 40 <a href="hertz" title="wikilink">Hz</a> and 60 Hz contains the same amount of sound power as the range between 400 Hz and 420 Hz, since both intervals are 20 Hz wide. Note that spectra are often plotted with a logarithmic frequency axis rather than a linear one, in which case equal physical widths on the printed or displayed plot do not all have the same bandwidth, with the same physical width covering more Hz at higher frequencies than at lower frequencies. In this case a white noise spectrum that is equally sampled in the logarithm of frequency (i.e., equally sampled on the X axis) will slope upwards at higher frequencies rather than being flat. However it is not unusual in practice for spectra to be calculated using linearly-spaced frequency samples but plotted on a logarithmic frequency axis, potentially leading to misunderstandings and confusion if the distinction between equally spaced linear frequency samples and equally spaced logarithmic frequency samples is not kept in mind.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> </p>
<h3 id="pink-noise">Pink noise</h3>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>Pink noise spectrum. Power density falls off at 10 dB/decade (−3 dB/octave).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The frequency spectrum of <a href="pink_noise" title="wikilink">pink noise</a> is linear in <a href="logarithmic_scale" title="wikilink">logarithmic space</a>; it has equal power in bands that are proportionally wide.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> This means that pink noise would have equal power in the frequency range from 40 to 60 Hz as in the band from 4000 to 6000 Hz. Since humans hear in such a proportional space, where a doubling of frequency (an octave) is perceived the same regardless of actual frequency (40–60 Hz is heard as the same interval and distance as 4000–6000 Hz), every octave contains the same amount of energy and thus pink noise is often used as a reference signal in <a href="audio_engineering" title="wikilink">audio engineering</a>. The <a href="spectral_power_density" title="wikilink">spectral power density</a>, compared with white noise, decreases by 3 <a href="decibel" title="wikilink">dB</a> per <a class="uri" href="octave" title="wikilink">octave</a> (density proportional to 1/<em>f</em> ). For this reason, pink noise is often called "1/<em>f</em> noise".</p>

<p>Since there are an infinite number of logarithmic bands at both the low frequency (DC) and high frequency ends of the spectrum, any finite energy spectrum must have less energy than pink noise at both ends. Pink noise is the only power-law spectral density that has this property: all steeper power-law spectra are finite if integrated to the high-frequency end, and all flatter power-law spectra are finite if integrated to the DC, low-frequency limit.  </p>
<h3 id="brownian-noise">Brown(ian) noise</h3>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>Brown spectrum (−6 dB/octave)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In fields that adopt precise definitions, the terminology "red noise", also called Brown noise or <a href="Brownian_noise" title="wikilink">Brownian noise</a>, will usually refer to a power density which decreases 6 dB per octave with increasing frequency (density proportional to 1/<em>f</em> <sup>2</sup>)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> over a frequency range which does not include <a href="direct_current" title="wikilink">DC</a> (in a general sense, does not include a constant component, or value at zero frequency). In areas where terminology is used loosely, "red noise" may refer to any system where power density decreases with increasing frequency.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>The first definition can be generated by an algorithm which simulates <a href="Brownian_motion" title="wikilink">Brownian motion</a> or by <a href="Integral" title="wikilink">integrating</a> white noise. "Brown" noise is not named for a power spectrum that suggests the colour brown; rather, the name is a corruption of Brownian motion. "Red noise" describes the shape of the power spectrum, with pink being between red and white. Also known as "random walk" or "drunkard's walk" noise.</p>
<h3 id="blue-noise">Blue noise</h3>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>Blue spectrum (+3 dB/octave)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Blue noise is also called azure noise. Blue noise's power density increases 3 dB per octave with increasing frequency (density proportional to <em>f</em> ) over a finite frequency range.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In computer graphics, the term "blue noise" is sometimes used more loosely as any noise with minimal low frequency components and no concentrated spikes in energy. This can be good noise for <a href="dither" title="wikilink">dithering</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> <a href="Retina" title="wikilink">Retinal</a> cells are arranged in a blue-noise-like pattern which yields good visual resolution.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Cherenkov_radiation" title="wikilink">Cherenkov radiation</a> is a naturally occurring example of almost perfect blue noise, with the power density growing linearly with frequency over spectrum regions where the permeability of index of refraction of the medium are approximately constant. The exact density spectrum is given by the <a href="Frank-Tamm_formula" title="wikilink">Frank-Tamm formula</a>. In this case, the finiteness of the frequency range comes from the finiteness of the range over which a material can have a refractive index greater than unity. Cherenkov radiation also appears as a bright blue color, for these reasons.</p>
<h3 id="violet-noise">Violet noise</h3>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>Violet spectrum (+6 dB/octave)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Violet noise is also called purple noise. Violet noise's power density increases 6 dB per octave with increasing frequency<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> (density proportional to <em>f</em> <sup>2</sup>) over a finite frequency range. It is also known as <a href="Derivative" title="wikilink">differentiated</a> white noise, due to its being the result of the differentiation of a white noise signal.</p>

<p>Acoustic thermal noise of water has a violet spectrum, causing it to dominate <a class="uri" href="hydrophone" title="wikilink">hydrophone</a> measurements at high frequencies.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> </p>
<h3 id="grey-noise">Grey noise</h3>

<p> <a href="Grey_noise" title="wikilink">Grey noise</a> is random white noise subjected to a psychoacoustic equal loudness curve (such as an inverted <a href="A-weighting_curve" title="wikilink">A-weighting curve</a>) over a given range of frequencies, giving the listener the perception that it is equally loud at all frequencies. This is in contrast to standard white noise which has equal strength over a linear scale of frequencies but is not perceived as being equally loud due to biases in the human <a href="equal-loudness_contour" title="wikilink">equal-loudness contour</a>.</p>
<h2 id="informal-definitions">Informal definitions</h2>

<p>There are also many colors used without precise definitions (or as synonyms for formally defined colors), sometimes with multiple definitions.</p>

<li>Joseph S. Wisniewski wrote that "green noise", as marketed by producers of ambient sound effects recordings, is "supposedly the background noise of the world." It is noise that simulates the spectra of natural settings, without man-made noises. It is similar to pink noise but it has more energy in the area of 500 Hz.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="black-noise">Black noise</h3>

<p>Black noise is also called silent noise.</p>
<ol>
<li><a class="uri" href="Silence" title="wikilink">Silence</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></li>
<li>Noise with a 1/f<sup>β</sup> spectrum, where β &gt; 2. This formula is used to model the frequency of natural disasters.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></li>
<li>Noise that has a frequency spectrum of predominantly zero power level over all frequencies except for a few narrow bands or spikes. <em>Note:</em> An example of black noise in a facsimile transmission system is the spectrum that might be obtained when scanning a black area in which there are a few random white spots. Thus, in the time domain, a few random pulses occur while scanning.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></li>
<li>Noise with a spectrum corresponding to the <a class="uri" href="blackbody" title="wikilink">blackbody</a> radiation (thermal noise). For temperatures higher than about  the <a href="Black-body_radiation#Wien's_displacement_law" title="wikilink">peak of the blackbody spectrum</a> is above the upper limit to human <a href="Hearing_range" title="wikilink">Hearing range</a>. In those situations, for the purposes of what is heard, black noise is well approximated as <a href="violet_noise" title="wikilink">violet noise</a>. At the same time, <a href="Hawking_radiation" title="wikilink">Hawking radiation</a> of <a href="black_hole" title="wikilink">black holes</a> may have a peak in hearing range, so the radiation of a typical <a href="stellar_black_hole" title="wikilink">stellar black hole</a> with a mass equal to 6 solar masses will have a maximum at a frequency of 604.5 Hz, this noise is similar to green one.
