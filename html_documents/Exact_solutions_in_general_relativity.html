<h1>Exact solutions in general relativity</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a href="general_relativity" title="wikilink">general relativity</a>, an <strong>exact solution</strong> is a <a href="Lorentzian_manifold" title="wikilink">Lorentzian manifold</a> equipped with certain <a href="tensor" title="wikilink">tensor fields</a> which are taken to model states of ordinary matter, such as a <a class="uri" href="fluid" title="wikilink">fluid</a>, or classical <a href="classical_field_theory" title="wikilink">nongravitational fields</a> such as the <a href="electromagnetic_field" title="wikilink">electromagnetic field</a>. These tensor fields should obey any relevant physical laws (for example, any electromagnetic field must satisfy <a href="Maxwell's_equations" title="wikilink">Maxwell's equations</a>). Following a standard recipe which is widely used in <a href="mathematical_physics" title="wikilink">mathematical physics</a>, these tensor fields should also give rise to specific contributions to the <a href="stress–energy_tensor" title="wikilink">stress–energy tensor</a>

Moreover, taking <a href="covariant_derivative" title="wikilink">covariant derivatives</a> of the field equations and applying the <a href="Bianchi_identities" title="wikilink">Bianchi identities</a>, it is found that a suitably varying amount/motion of nongravitational energy–momentum can cause ripples in curvature to propagate as <a href="gravitational_radiation" title="wikilink">gravitational radiation</a>, even across <em><a href="Einstein_field_equations#Vacuum_field_equations" title="wikilink">vacuum regions</a></em>, which contain no matter or nongravitational fields.</p>

. Thus <em>any</em> Lorentzian manifold is a solution of the <a href="Einstein_field_equation" title="wikilink">Einstein field equation</a> with <em>some</em> right hand side. Which of course doesn't make <a href="general_relativity" title="wikilink">general relativity</a> useless, but only shows that there are two complementary ways to use it. One can fix the form of the stress–energy tensor (from some physical reasons, say) and study the solutions of the Einstein equations with such right hand side (for example, if the stress–energy tensor is chosen to be that of the perfect fluid, a spherically symmetric solution can serve as a <a href="Static_spherically_symmetric_perfect_fluid" title="wikilink">stellar model</a>). Alternatively, one can fix some <em>geometrical</em> properties of a spacetime and look for a matter source that could provide these properties. This is what cosmologists have done for the last 5–10 years: they assume that the Universe is homogeneous, isotropic, and accelerating and try to realize what matter (called <a href="dark_energy" title="wikilink">dark energy</a>) can support such a structure.</p>

<p>Within the first approach the alleged stress–energy tensor must arise in the standard way from a "reasonable" matter distribution or nongravitational field. In practice, this notion is pretty clear, especially if you restrict the admissible nongravitational fields to the only one known in 1916, the <a href="electromagnetic_field" title="wikilink">electromagnetic field</a>. But ideally we would like to have some <em>mathematical characterization</em> that states some purely mathematical test which we can apply to any putative "stress–energy tensor", which passes everything which might arise from a "reasonable" physical scenario, and rejects everything else. Unfortunately, no such characterization is known. Instead, we have crude tests known as the <a href="energy_conditions" title="wikilink">energy conditions</a>, which are similar to placing restrictions on the <a class="uri" href="eigenvalues" title="wikilink">eigenvalues</a> and <a class="uri" href="eigenvectors" title="wikilink">eigenvectors</a> of a <a href="linear_operator" title="wikilink">linear operator</a>. But these conditions, it seems, can satisfy no-one. On the one hand, they are far too permissive: they would admit "solutions" which almost no-one believes are physically reasonable. On the other, they may be far too restrictive: the most popular energy conditions are apparently violated by the <a href="Casimir_effect" title="wikilink">Casimir effect</a>.</p>

<p>Einstein also recognized another element of the definition of an exact solution: it should be a Lorentzian manifold (meeting additional criteria), i.e. a <a href="smooth_manifold" title="wikilink">smooth manifold</a>. But in working with general relativity, it turns out to be very useful to admit solutions which are not everywhere smooth; examples include many solutions created by matching a perfect fluid interior solution to a vacuum exterior solution, and <a href="impulsive_plane_waves" title="wikilink">impulsive plane waves</a>. Once again, the creative tension between elegance and convenience, respectively, has proven difficult to resolve satisfactorily.</p>

<p>In addition to such <a href="local_spacetime_structure" title="wikilink">local</a> objections, we have the far more challenging problem that there are very many exact solutions which are locally unobjectionable, but <a href="global_spacetime_structure" title="wikilink">globally</a> exhibit causally suspect features such as <a href="closed_timelike_curve" title="wikilink">closed timelike curves</a> or structures with points of separation ("trouser worlds"). Some of the best known exact solutions, in fact, have globally a strange character.</p>

<h2 id="constructing-solutions">Constructing solutions</h2>

<p>The Einstein field equation, when fully written out as a system of partial differential equations, takes the form of a rather complicated system of coupled, <a class="uri" href="nonlinear" title="wikilink">nonlinear</a> partial differential equations. As such, in general, it is very hard to solve.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, several effective techniques for obtaining exact solutions are available.</p>

<p>The simplest involves imposing symmetry conditions on the <a href="metric_tensor_(general_relativity)" title="wikilink">metric tensor</a>, such as <a href="stationary_spacetime" title="wikilink">stationarity</a> (symmetry under <a href="time_translation" title="wikilink">time translation</a>) or axisymmetry (symmetry under rotation about some <a href="axis_of_rotation" title="wikilink">symmetry axis</a>). With sufficiently clever assumptions of this sort, it is often possible to reduce the Einstein field equation to a much simpler system of equations, even a single <a href="partial_differential_equation" title="wikilink">partial differential equation</a> (as happens in the case of <strong><em>stationary axisymmetric vacuum solutions</em></strong>, which are characterized by the <a href="Ernst_equation" title="wikilink">Ernst equation</a>) or a system of <em>ordinary</em> differential equations (as happens in the case of the <a href="Deriving_the_Schwarzschild_solution" title="wikilink">Schwarzschild vacuum</a>).</p>

<p>This naive approach usually works best if one uses a <a href="frame_fields_in_general_relativity" title="wikilink">frame field</a> rather than a <strong><em>coordinate basis</em></strong>.</p>

<p>A related idea involves imposing <strong><em>algebraic symmetry conditions</em></strong> on the <a href="Weyl_tensor" title="wikilink">Weyl tensor</a>, <a href="Ricci_tensor" title="wikilink">Ricci tensor</a>, or <a href="Riemann_tensor" title="wikilink">Riemann tensor</a>. These are often stated in terms of the <a href="Petrov_classification" title="wikilink">Petrov classification</a> of the possible symmetries of the Weyl tensor, or the <a href="Segre_classification" title="wikilink">Segre classification</a> of the possible symmetries of the Ricci tensor. As will be apparent from the discussion above, such <em>Ansätze</em> often do have some physical content, although this might not be apparent from their mathematical form.</p>

<p>This second kind of symmetry approach has often been used with the <a href="Newman–Penrose_formalism" title="wikilink">Newman–Penrose formalism</a>, which uses spinorial quantities for more efficient bookkeeping.</p>

<p>Even after such <strong><em>symmetry reductions</em></strong>, the reduced system of equations is often difficult to solve. For example, the Ernst equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation somewhat resembling the <a href="nonlinear_Schrödinger_equation" title="wikilink">nonlinear Schrödinger equation</a> (NLS).</p>

<p>But recall that the <a href="conformal_group" title="wikilink">conformal group</a> on <a href="Minkowski_spacetime" title="wikilink">Minkowski spacetime</a> is the symmetry group of the <a href="Maxwell_equations" title="wikilink">Maxwell equations</a>. Recall too that solutions of the <a href="heat_equation" title="wikilink">heat equation</a> can be found by assuming a scaling <em>Ansatz</em>. These notions are merely special cases of <a href="Sophus_Lie" title="wikilink">Sophus Lie</a>'s notion of the <a href="point_symmetry" title="wikilink">point symmetry</a> of a differential equation (or system of equations), and as Lie showed, this can provide an avenue of attack upon any differential equation which has a nontrivial symmetry group. Indeed, both the Ernst equation and the NLS have nontrivial symmetry groups, and some solutions can be found by taking advantage of their symmetries. These symmetry groups are often infinite dimensional, but this is not always a useful feature.</p>

<p><a href="Emmy_Noether" title="wikilink">Emmy Noether</a> showed that a slight but profound generalization of Lie's notion of symmetry can result in an even more powerful method of attack. This turns out to be closely related to the discovery that some equations, which are said to be <a href="completely_integrable" title="wikilink">completely integrable</a>, enjoy an <em>infinite sequence of conservation laws</em>. Quite remarkably, both the Ernst equation (which arises several ways in the studies of exact solutions) and the NLS turn out to be completely integrable. They are therefore susceptible to solution by techniques resembling the <a href="inverse_scattering_transform" title="wikilink">inverse scattering transform</a> which was originally developed to solve the <a href="Korteweg–de_Vries_equation" title="wikilink">Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation</a>, a nonlinear partial differential equation which arises in the theory of <a class="uri" href="solitons" title="wikilink">solitons</a>, and which is also completely integrable. Unfortunately, the solutions obtained by these methods are often not as nice as one would like. For example, in a manner analogous to the way that one obtains a multiple soliton solution of the KdV from the single soliton solution (which can be found from Lie's notion of point symmetry), one can obtain a multiple Kerr object solution, but unfortunately, this has some features which make it physically implausible.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>There are also various transformations (see <a href="Belinski-Zakharov_transform" title="wikilink">Belinski-Zakharov transform</a>) which can transform (for example) a vacuum solution found by other means into a new vacuum solution, or into an electrovacuum solution, or a fluid solution. These are analogous to the <a href="Bäcklund_transformation" title="wikilink">Bäcklund transformations</a> known from the theory of certain <a href="partial_differential_equation" title="wikilink">partial differential equations</a>, including some famous examples of <a class="uri" href="soliton" title="wikilink">soliton</a> equations. This is no coincidence, since this phenomenon is also related to the notions of Noether and Lie regarding symmetry. Unfortunately, even when applied to a "well understood", globally admissible solution, these transformations often yield a solution which is poorly understood and their general interpretation is still unknown.</p>
<h2 id="existence-of-solutions">Existence of solutions</h2>

<p>Given the difficulty of constructing explicit small families of solutions, much less presenting something like a "general" solution to the Einstein field equation, or even a "general" solution to the <em>vacuum</em> field equation, a very reasonable approach is to try to find qualitative properties which hold for all solutions, or at least for all <em>vacuum</em> solutions. One of the most basic questions one can ask is: do solutions exist, and if so, <em>how many</em>?</p>

<p>To get started, we should adopt a suitable <a href="initial_value_problem_in_general_relativity" title="wikilink">initial value formulation</a> of the field equation, which gives two new systems of equations, one giving a <em>constraint</em> on the <em>initial data</em>, and the other giving a procedure for <em>evolving</em> this initial data into a solution. Then, one can prove that solutions exist at least <em>locally</em>, using ideas not terribly dissimilar from those encountered in studying other differential equations.</p>

<p>To get some idea of "how many" solutions we might optimistically expect, we can appeal to Einstein's <a href="constraint_counting" title="wikilink">constraint counting</a> method. A typical conclusion from this style of argument is that a <em>generic vacuum solution</em> to the Einstein field equation can be specified by giving four arbitrary functions of three variables and six arbitrary functions of two variables. These functions specify <strong>initial data</strong>, from which a unique vacuum solution can be <em>evolved</em>. (In contrast, the Ernst vacuums, the family of all stationary axisymmetric vacuum solutions, are specified by giving just two functions of two variables, which are not even arbitrary, but must satisfy a system of two coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. This may give some idea of how just tiny a typical "large" family of exact solutions really is, in the grand scheme of things.)</p>

<p>However, this crude analysis falls far short of the much more difficult question of <em>global existence</em> of solutions. The global existence results which are known so far turn out to involve another idea.</p>
<h2 id="global-stability-theorems">Global stability theorems</h2>

<p>We can imagine "disturbing" the gravitational field outside some isolated massive object by "sending in some radiation from infinity". We can ask: what happens as the incoming radiation interacts with the ambient field? In the approach of classical <a href="perturbation_theory" title="wikilink">perturbation theory</a>, we can start with Minkowksi vacuum (or another very simple solution, such as the de Sitter lambdavacuum), introduce very small metric perturbations, and retain only terms up to some <strong>order</strong> in a suitable <strong>perturbation</strong> expansion—somewhat like evaluating a kind of Taylor series for the geometry of our spacetime. This approach is essentially the idea behind the <a href="post-Newtonian_approximation" title="wikilink">post-Newtonian approximations</a> used in constructing models of a gravitating system such as a <a href="binary_pulsar" title="wikilink">binary pulsar</a>. However, perturbation expansions are generally not reliable for questions of long-term existence and stability, in the case of nonlinear equations.</p>

<p>The full field equation is highly nonlinear, so we really want to prove that the Minkowski vacuum is <strong>stable</strong> under small perturbations which are treated <em>using the fully nonlinear field equation</em>. This requires the introduction of many new ideas. The desired result, sometimes expressed by the slogan that <strong>the Minkowski vacuum is nonlinearly stable</strong>, was finally proven by <a href="Demetrios_Christodoulou" title="wikilink">Demetrios Christodoulou</a> and <a href="Sergiu_Klainerman" title="wikilink">Sergiu Klainerman</a> only in 1993. Analogous results are known for lambdavac perturbations of the de Sitter lambdavacuum (<a href="Helmut_Friedrich" title="wikilink">Helmut Friedrich</a>) and for electrovacuum perturbations of the Minkowski vacuum (<a href="Nina_Zipser" title="wikilink">Nina Zipser</a>).</p>
<h2 id="the-positive-energy-theorem">The positive energy theorem</h2>

<p>Another issue we might worry about is whether the net mass-energy of an <em>isolated concentration</em> of positive mass-energy density (and momentum) always yields a well-defined (and non-negative) net mass. This result, known as the <a href="positive_energy_theorem" title="wikilink">positive energy theorem</a> was finally proven by <a href="Richard_Schoen" title="wikilink">Richard Schoen</a> and <a href="Shing-Tung_Yau" title="wikilink">Shing-Tung Yau</a> in 1979, who made an additional technical assumption about the nature of the stress–energy tensor. The original proof is very difficult; <a href="Edward_Witten" title="wikilink">Edward Witten</a> soon presented a much shorter "physicist's proof", which has been justified by mathematicians—using further very difficult arguments. <a href="Roger_Penrose" title="wikilink">Roger Penrose</a> and others have also offered alternative arguments for variants of the original positive energy theorem.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Noteworthy examples of vacuum solutions, electrovacuum solutions, and so forth, are listed in specialized articles (see below). These solutions contain at most one contribution to the <a href="energy–momentum_tensor" title="wikilink">energy–momentum tensor</a>, due to a specific kind of matter or field. However, there are some notable exact solutions which contain two or three contributions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="NUT-Kerr–Newman–de_Sitter_solution" title="wikilink">NUT-Kerr–Newman–de Sitter solution</a> contains contributions from an electromagnetic field and a positive vacuum energy, as well as a kind of vacuum perturbation of the Kerr vacuum which is specified by the so-called NUT parameter,</li>
<li><a href="Gödel_metric" title="wikilink">Gödel dust</a> contains contributions from a pressureless perfect fluid (dust) and from a positive vacuum energy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some hypothetical possibilities which don't fit into our rough classification are:</p>
<ul>
<li>certain <a href="wormhole_metrics" title="wikilink">wormhole metrics</a> (which can serve as a speculative <a href="toy_model" title="wikilink">toy model</a> of a <a class="uri" href="stargate" title="wikilink">stargate</a> held open by a hypothetical kind of <a href="exotic_matter" title="wikilink">exotic matter</a>, as in <a href="2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(novel)" title="wikilink">2001: A Space Odyssey</a>; also a toy model of hypothetical <a href="time_travel" title="wikilink">time machine</a>, see below),</li>
<li><a href="Alcubierre_metric" title="wikilink">Alcubierre metric</a> (which has been used as a speculative toy model of effectively <a class="uri" href="superluminal" title="wikilink">superluminal</a> space travel, as in the <a href="warp_drive_(Star_Trek)" title="wikilink">warp drive</a> from <a href="Star_Trek" title="wikilink">Star Trek</a>).</li>
<li>"Time machines", i.e. initially nice spacetimes in which at some stage of evolution closed causal curves appear.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some doubt has been cast upon whether sufficient quantity of exotic matter needed for wormholes and Alcubierre bubbles can exist.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Later, however, these doubts were shown<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> to be mostly groundless. The third of these examples, in particular, is an instructive example of the procedure mentioned above for turning any Lorentzian manifold into a "solution". It is along this way that Hawking succeeded in proving<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> that time machines of a certain type (those with a "compactly generated Cauchy horizon") cannot appear without exotic matter. Such spacetimes are also a good illustration of the fact that unless a spacetime is especially nice ("globally hyperbolic") the Einstein equations do not determine its evolution <em>uniquely</em>. Any spacetime <em>may</em> evolve into a time machine, but it <em>never has to</em> do so.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
