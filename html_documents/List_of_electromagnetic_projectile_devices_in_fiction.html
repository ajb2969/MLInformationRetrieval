<h1>List of electromagnetic projectile devices in fiction</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Electromagnetic projectile devices</strong> often appear in <a class="uri" href="fiction" title="wikilink">fiction</a>, especially <a href="science_fiction" title="wikilink">science fiction</a> where they are described as <strong><a href="Kinetic_energy_weapon" title="wikilink">Kinetic energy weaponry</a></strong>, <strong><a href="gauss_gun" title="wikilink">gauss guns</a></strong>, <strong><a href="mass_driver" title="wikilink">mass drivers</a></strong> or <strong><a href="railgun" title="wikilink">railguns</a></strong>. However, their fictional behavior rarely matches that of real-life projectile devices, which are typically much less powerful and far more bulky.</p>
<h2 id="realism-of-depictions">Realism of depictions</h2>

<p>Some fictional sources describe the projectile as moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, implying an unrealistically high amount of energy given current human capabilities.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The coordinate mass (mass accounting for effects of <a href="special_relativity" title="wikilink">special relativity</a> based on velocity) of a projectile is

, where m is the coordinate mass, and v is the velocity. As the velocity of the projectile increases, the total mass increases quickly, making it immensely hard for velocities of such magnitude to be attained. To date only microscopic particles have been induced to go so fast through human technology.</p>

<p>In fiction they can depicted as firing inert projectiles from orbit directly at planetary surface targets (EG: Babylon 5, series 2 – the Centauri invade the Narn home world after an attack using "Mass Drivers") as if the target and the shooter are not moving relative to each other, and do not have a gravity well nearby to effect the projectiles' trajectory. They point the gun at the target, and shoot, and hit the target, from orbit. In reality, at least if the muzzle velocity is not much greater than the orbital velocity, they would not be aiming at the surface, but firing behind their orbit, so that the projectiles would lose their orbital velocity and free-fall to the surface.</p>
<h2 id="literature">Literature</h2>
<ul>
<li>In the 1955 novel <em><a class="uri" href="Earthlight" title="wikilink">Earthlight</a></em> by Arthur C. Clarke, an electromagnetically propelled piece of molten metal is fired from a fortress at an advanced warship, astounding a nearby observer who sees a beam of light (on the airless Moon) stabbing the warship and destroying it. Later it was shown that molten metal cannot be accelerated by a magnetic field as metal loses its magnetic properties in a molten state, and Clarke admitted his error gracefully.</li>
<li>In Harry Harrison's book <em><a href="The_Stainless_Steel_Rat" title="wikilink">The Stainless Steel Rat</a>'s Revenge</em> gauss rifles are the standard armament of Cliaand soldiers.</li>
<li>The first mass driver known in print was called the "electric gun", a method of launching vehicles into outer space from the Earth's surface, in the 1897 science fiction novel <em>A Trip to Venus</em> by John Munro, published by Jarrold &amp; Sons, London.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Munro describes multiple coils fired in timed sequence by solenoids to achieve acceleration without excessive G-forces that would be harmful to the passengers.

Other <em>Rifts</em> character classes, specifically robots and cyborgs, have access to railguns.</li>
<li>In the world of <em><a href="Warhammer_40,000" title="wikilink">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>, the <a href="Tau_(Warhammer_40,000)" title="wikilink">Tau</a> railgun is one of the most powerful guns in the game available as a personal weapon.

XV-88 Broadside Battlesuits carry high-power twin-linked shoulder railguns. The <a class="uri" href="Necrons" title="wikilink">Necrons</a> also use several forms of Gauss weaponry, however this is a misnomer, as their weapons break inter-molecular bonds, and have no projectile.</li>

However despite the reference to coilguns, the description of their operation indicates that they are <a href="railgun" title="wikilink">railguns</a>.</li>
<li>In <em><a class="uri" href="Thing-Thing" title="wikilink">Thing-Thing</a></em>, the player may acquire a railgun.</li>
<li>In the classic role-playing game <a href="Space_Master" title="wikilink">Space Master</a>, railguns are a common projectile weapon in 10th-millennium combat. In the context of the game world, they are called Magnetic Linear Accelerators, abbreviated as MLAs.</li>
<li>In the anime <a href="Metal_Armor_Dragonar" title="wikilink">Dragonar</a>, the Giganos Empire uses a giant mass driver on the moon to attack Earth although it was originally used for transporting large rocks. Before dying, the Giganos leader, Giltorre, orders Meio Platt to destroy it.</li>
<li>In the <em><a href="Starfire_(board_wargame)" title="wikilink">Starfire</a></em> series add-on <em>Alkelda Dawn</em>, the interstellar race known as the "Umbra of Vestrii" use kinetic weapons.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="computer-and-video-games">Computer and video games</h2>

<p>Some computer games feature railguns as weapons. The most popular type of ammunition for these railguns are <a href="depleted_uranium" title="wikilink">depleted uranium</a> slugs. A common trait shared by many railguns in different games is the ability for a slug (or other ammo type) to hit and pass though multiple enemies with one shot as well as allowing one to see, one shot kill, and/or shoot though solid matter by use of some type of x-ray or even a thermal aiming device (mainly in first-person shooters). This is conspicuously similar to the behavior of the railguns in the aforementioned movie "Eraser", which was released during the first person shooter boom.</p>

<p>Other traits can include these weapons being able to do electricity- or <a href="Electromagnetic_pulse" title="wikilink">EMP</a>-based damage because most railguns in video games use <a class="uri" href="electromagnets" title="wikilink">electromagnets</a> as a main power source.</p>

In the penultimate level of <em>Halo: Reach</em>, a bus-sized mass driver coilgun is used to destroy hostile dropships and a battlecruiser until the player's allies, in the cruiser <em>Pillar of Autumn</em>, can be launched. <em>Halo 4</em> introduces a hand-held single-shot railgun.</li>

Within the game, the fictional Element Zero can be used to increase or decrease the mass of the slug via dark energy, allowing to accelerate it to phenomenal (usually <a href="Relativistic_speed" title="wikilink">relativistic</a>) speeds with little recoil, hence "mass accelerator weaponry". The projectile used is at the size of a grain of sand (in case of firearms), and is sheared off a large piece of metal - which lasts for thousands of shots - by the internal systems. However, the thermal energy produced by the weaponry is enormous, managed by passive cooling in the first game and by ejecting single-use "thermal clips" in the second. The rail-gun nature of this weapon is confirmed by the upgrade options "Extended Rails" and "SCRAM Rails".
<ul>
<li>Similar weapons have been in use by <a href="Races_of_the_Mass_Effect_universe#Reapers" title="wikilink">the Reapers</a> and the species they exterminated for at least 37 million years. One such weapon left a mark at the size of <a href="Valles_Marineris" title="wikilink">Valles Marineris</a> by a glancing blow on a planet, located in a star system hundreds of light-years away from the intended target. An <a href="Non-player_character" title="wikilink">NPC</a> can be heard warning a few recruits about the unlimited range of space-borne mass accelerators and inevitable collateral damage: "...you are ruining someone's day - somewhere, sometime!"</li>
<li>The series' Reapers features a "magnetohydrodynamic" weapon that, like Arthur C. Clarke's weapon from <em><a class="uri" href="Earthlight" title="wikilink">Earthlight</a></em>, uses molten metal suspended and ejected by an electromagnetic field, along with the mass effect technology to accelerate it at a fraction of the speed of light. This gives it the appearance of an energy weapon. Also like Arthur C. Clarke's <em><a class="uri" href="Earthlight" title="wikilink">Earthlight</a></em>, it has the same fatal error; molten metal cannot be accelerated by a magnetic field, as metal loses its magnetic properties in a molten state.</li>
