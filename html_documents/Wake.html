<p>A <strong>wake</strong> is the region of recirculating flow immediately behind a moving or stationary solid body, caused by the flow of surrounding fluid around the body.</p>
<h2 id="fluid-dynamics">Fluid dynamics</h2>

<p>In <a href="fluid_dynamics" title="wikilink">fluid dynamics</a>, a <strong>wake</strong> is the region of disturbed flow (usually <a class="uri" href="turbulent" title="wikilink">turbulent</a>) downstream of a solid body moving through a fluid, caused by the flow of the <a class="uri" href="fluid" title="wikilink">fluid</a> around the body. In incompressible fluids (liquids) such as water, a <a href="Bow_wave" title="wikilink">bow</a> wake is created when a watercraft moves through the medium; as the medium cannot be compressed, it must be displaced instead, resulting in a wave. As with all <a href="wave_form" title="wikilink">wave forms</a>, it spreads outward from the source until its <a class="uri" href="energy" title="wikilink">energy</a> is overcome or lost, usually by <a class="uri" href="friction" title="wikilink">friction</a> or <a href="dispersion_(water_waves)" title="wikilink">dispersion</a>.</p>

<p>The formation of these waves in liquids is analogous to the generation of shockwaves in compressible flow, such as those generated by rockets and aircraft traveling supersonic through air (see also <a href="Lighthill_equation" title="wikilink">Lighthill equation</a>). The non-dimensional parameter of interest is the <a href="Froude_number" title="wikilink">Froude number</a>.</p>

<p>For a blunt body in <a href="subsonic_flight" title="wikilink">subsonic</a> external flow, for example the <a href="Apollo_program" title="wikilink">Apollo</a> or <a href="Orion_Multi-Purpose_Crew_Vehicle" title="wikilink">Orion</a> capsules during descent and landing, the wake is massively <a href="flow_separation" title="wikilink">separated</a> and behind the body is a reverse flow region where the flow is moving toward the body. This phenomenon is often observed in <a href="wind_tunnel" title="wikilink">wind tunnel</a> testing of aircraft, and is especially important when <a class="uri" href="parachute" title="wikilink">parachute</a> systems are involved, because unless the parachute lines extend the canopy beyond the reverse flow region, the chute can fail to inflate and thus collapse. Parachutes deployed into wakes suffer <a href="dynamic_pressure" title="wikilink">dynamic pressure</a> deficits which reduce their expected <a href="drag_(physics)" title="wikilink">drag</a> forces. High-fidelity <a href="computational_fluid_dynamics" title="wikilink">computational fluid dynamics</a> simulations are often undertaken to model wake flows, although such modeling has uncertainties associated with <a href="turbulence_modeling" title="wikilink">turbulence modeling</a> (for example <a href="Reynolds-averaged_Navier–Stokes_equations" title="wikilink">RANS</a> versus <a href="Large_eddy_simulation" title="wikilink">LES</a> implementations), in addition to unsteady flow effects. Example applications include rocket stage separation and aircraft store separation.</p>
<h2 id="wake-patterns-in-water">Wake patterns in water</h2>

<p>Waterfowl and boats moving across the surface of water produce a wake pattern, first explained mathematically by <a href="Lord_Kelvin" title="wikilink">Lord Kelvin</a> and known today as the Kelvin wake pattern.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> This pattern consists of two wake lines that form the arms of a V, with the source of the wake at the vertex of the V. Each wake line is offset from the path of the wake source by around 19.47° and is made up of feathery wavelets angled at roughly 53° to the path. The inside of the V is filled with transverse curved waves, each of which is an arc of a circle centered at a point lying on the path at a distance twice that of the arc to the wake source. This pattern is independent of the speed and size of the wake source over a significant range of values. The pattern changes only at high speeds; viz, above a hull <a href="Froude_number" title="wikilink">Froude number</a> of approximately 0.5. Then, as the source's speed increases, the transverse waves diminish and the points of maximum amplitude on the wavelets form a second V within the wake pattern, which grows narrower with the increased speed of the source.<ref>The "hull Froude number" (Fr) of a ship is

<p>The angles in this pattern are not intrinsic properties of water; Any <a class="uri" href="isentropic" title="wikilink">isentropic</a> and incompressible liquid with low viscosity will exhibit the same phenomenon. This phenomenon has nothing to do with turbulence. Everything discussed here is based on the linear theory of an ideal fluid.</p>

<p>Parts of the pattern may be obscured by the effects of propeller wash, and tail eddies behind the boat's stern, and by the boat being a large object and not a point source. The water need not be stationary, but may be moving as in a large river, and the important consideration then is the velocity of the water relative to a boat or other object causing a wake.</p>

<p>This pattern follows from the <a href="Airy_wave_theory#Dispersion_relation" title="wikilink">dispersion relation of deep water waves</a>, which is often written as,</p>

<h2 id="other-effects">Other effects</h2>

<p>The above describes an ideal wake, where the body's means of propulsion has no other effect on the water. In practice the wave pattern between the V-shaped wavefronts is usually mixed with the effects of propeller backwash and eddying behind the boat's (usually square-ended) stern.</p>

<p>"No wake zones" may prohibit wakes in <a class="uri" href="marinas" title="wikilink">marinas</a>, near moorings and within some distance of shore<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> in order to facilitate recreation by other boats and reduce the damage wakes cause. Powered <a href="narrowboat" title="wikilink">narrowboats</a> on British canals are not permitted to create a breaking wash (a wake large enough to create a breaking wave) along the banks, as this erodes them. This rule normally restricts these vessels to 4 statute miles per hour or less.</p>

<p>Wakes are occasionally used recreationally. Swimmers, people riding personal watercraft, and aquatic mammals such as dolphins can ride the leading edge of a wake. In the sport of wakeboarding the wake is used as a jump. The wake is also used to propel a surfer in the sport of wakesurfing. In the sport of <a href="water_polo" title="wikilink">water polo</a>, the ball carrier can swim while advancing the ball, propelled ahead with the wake created by alternating armstrokes in <a href="crawl_stroke" title="wikilink">crawl stroke</a>, a technique known as <a class="uri" href="dribbling" title="wikilink">dribbling</a>.</p>
