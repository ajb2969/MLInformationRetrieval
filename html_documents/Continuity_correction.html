<h1>Continuity correction</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a href="probability_theory" title="wikilink">probability theory</a>, a <strong>continuity correction</strong> is an adjustment that is made when a discrete <a href="Probability_distribution" title="wikilink">distribution</a> is approximated by a continuous distribution.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<h3 id="binomial">Binomial</h3>

<p>If a <a href="random_variable" title="wikilink">random variable</a> <em>X</em> has a <a href="binomial_distribution" title="wikilink">binomial distribution</a> with parameters <em>n</em> and <em>p</em>, i.e., <em>X</em> is distributed as the number of "successes" in <em>n</em> independent <a href="Bernoulli_trial" title="wikilink">Bernoulli trials</a> with probability <em>p</em> of success on each trial, then</p>

<p><span class="LaTeX">$$P(X\leq x) = P(X<x+1)< math="">

for any ''x'' ∈ {0, 1, 2, ... ''n''}.  If ''np'' and ''np''(1 − ''p'') are large (sometimes taken to mean ≥ 5), then the probability above is fairly well approximated by

:<math>P(Y\leq x+1/2)$$</math></x+1)<></span></p>

<p>where <em>Y</em> is a <a href="normal_distribution" title="wikilink">normally distributed</a> random variable with the same <a href="expected_value" title="wikilink">expected value</a> and the same <a class="uri" href="variance" title="wikilink">variance</a> as <em>X</em>, i.e., E(<em>Y</em>) = <em>np</em> and var(<em>Y</em>) = <em>np</em>(1 − <em>p</em>). This addition of 1/2 to <em>x</em> is a continuity correction.</p>
<h3 id="poisson">Poisson</h3>

<p>A continuity correction can also be applied when other discrete distributions supported on the integers are approximated by the normal distribution. For example, if <em>X</em> has a <a href="Poisson_distribution" title="wikilink">Poisson distribution</a> with expected value λ then the variance of <em>X</em> is also λ, and</p>

<p><span class="LaTeX">$$P(X\leq x)=P(X<x+1)\approx 2)<="" math="" p(y\leq="" x+1="">

if ''Y'' is normally distributed with expectation and variance both λ.

==Applications==
Before the ready availability of [[statistical software]] having the ability to evaluate probability distribution functions accurately, continuity corrections played an important role in the practical application of [[statistical hypothesis test|statistical tests]] in which the test statistic has a discrete distribution: it was a special importance for manual calculations. A particular example of this is the [[binomial test]], involving the [[binomial distribution]], as in [[checking whether a coin is fair]]. Where extreme accuracy is not necessary, computer calculations for some ranges of parameters may still rely on using continuity corrections to improve accuracy while retaining simplicity.
