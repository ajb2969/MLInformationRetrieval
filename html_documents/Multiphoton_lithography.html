<h1>Multiphoton lithography</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Multiphoton lithography</strong> (also known as <a href="direct_laser_lithography" title="wikilink">direct laser lithography</a> or <a href="direct_laser_writing" title="wikilink">direct laser writing</a>) of <a class="uri" href="polymer" title="wikilink">polymer</a> templates has been known for years by the <a href="photonic_crystal" title="wikilink">photonic crystal</a> community. Similar to standard <a class="uri" href="photolithography" title="wikilink">photolithography</a> techniques, structuring is accomplished by illuminating negative-tone or positive-tone <a href="photoresist" title="wikilink">photoresists</a> via light of a well-defined wavelength. The fundamental difference is, however, the avoidance of reticles. Instead, <a href="two-photon_absorption" title="wikilink">two-photon absorption</a> is utilized to induce a dramatic change in the solubility of the resist for appropriate developers.</p>

<p>Hence, multiphoton lithography is a technique for creating small features in a <a class="uri" href="photosensitive" title="wikilink">photosensitive</a> material, without the use of complex <a href="optics" title="wikilink">optical</a> systems or <a href="photomask" title="wikilink">photomasks</a>. This method relies on a multi-photon absorption process in a material that is transparent at the wavelength of the <a class="uri" href="laser" title="wikilink">laser</a> used for creating the pattern. By scanning and properly modulating the laser, a chemical change (usually <a class="uri" href="polymerization" title="wikilink">polymerization</a>) occurs at the focal spot of the laser and can be controlled to create an arbitrary three-dimensional periodic or non-periodic pattern. This method has been used for <a href="rapid_prototyping" title="wikilink">rapid prototyping</a> of structures with fine features.</p>

<p><a href="Two-photon_absorption" title="wikilink">Two-photon absorption</a> is a third-order with respect to the <a href="Nonlinear_optics" title="wikilink">third-order optical susceptibility</a>

 and a <a href="Two-photon_absorption" title="wikilink">second-order process with respect to light intensity</a>. For this reason it is a non-linear process several orders of magnitude weaker than linear absorption, thus very high light intensities are required to increase the number of such rare events. For example, tightly-focused laser beams provide the needed intensities. Here, pulsed laser sources are preferred as they deliver high-intensity pulses while depositing a relatively low average energy. To enable 3D structuring, the light source must be adequately adapted to the photoresist in that single-photon absorption is highly suppressed while two-photon absorption is favoured. This condition is met if and only if the resist is highly transparent for the laser light's output wavelength λ and, simultaneously, absorbing at λ/2. As a result, a given sample relative to the focused laser beam can be scanned while changing the resist's solubility only in a confined volume. The geometry of the latter mainly depends on the iso-intensity surfaces of the focus. Concretely, those regions of the laser beam which exceed a given exposure threshold of the photosensitive medium define the basic building block, the so-called <em><a class="uri" href="voxel" title="wikilink">voxel</a></em>. Other parameters which influence the actual shape of the voxel are the laser mode and the refractive-index mismatch between the resist and the immersion system leading to spherical aberration.</p>
