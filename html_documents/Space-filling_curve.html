<h1>Space-filling curve</h1>
<hr/>
<p> In <a href="mathematical_analysis" title="wikilink">mathematical analysis</a>, a <strong>space-filling curve</strong> is a <a class="uri" href="curve" title="wikilink">curve</a> whose <a href="Range_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">range</a> contains the entire 2-dimensional <a href="unit_square" title="wikilink">unit square</a> (or more generally an <em>n</em>-dimensional <a class="uri" href="hypercube" title="wikilink">hypercube</a>). Because <a href="Giuseppe_Peano" title="wikilink">Giuseppe Peano</a> (1858–1932) was the first to discover one, space-filling curves in the <a href="plane_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">2-dimensional plane</a> are sometimes called <em>Peano curves</em>, but that phrase also refers to the <a href="Peano_curve" title="wikilink">Peano curve</a>, the specific example of a space-filling curve found by Peano.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>Intuitively, a continuous curve in 2 or 3 (or higher) dimensions can be thought of as the path of a continuously moving point. To eliminate the inherent vagueness of this notion, <a href="Camille_Jordan" title="wikilink">Jordan</a> in 1887 introduced the following rigorous definition, which has since been adopted as the precise description of the notion of a <em>continuous curve</em>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>A curve (with endpoints) is a <a href="continuous_function" title="wikilink">continuous function</a> whose domain is the <a href="unit_interval" title="wikilink">unit interval</a> [0, 1].
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the most general form, the range of such a function may lie in an arbitrary <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topological space</a>, but in the most commonly studied cases, the range will lie in a <a href="Euclidean_space" title="wikilink">Euclidean space</a> such as the 2-dimensional plane (a <em>planar curve</em>) or the 3-dimensional space (<em>space curve</em>).</p>
<p>Sometimes, the curve is identified with the range or image of the function (the set of all possible values of the function), instead of the function itself. It is also possible to define curves without endpoints to be a continuous function on the real line (or on the open unit interval (0, 1)).</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>In 1890, <a class="uri" href="Peano" title="wikilink">Peano</a> discovered a continuous curve, now called the <a href="Peano_curve" title="wikilink">Peano curve</a>, that passes through every point of the unit square. () His purpose was to construct a <a href="continuous_mapping" title="wikilink">continuous mapping</a> from the <a href="unit_interval" title="wikilink">unit interval</a> onto the <a href="unit_square" title="wikilink">unit square</a>. Peano was motivated by <a href="Georg_Cantor" title="wikilink">Georg Cantor</a>'s earlier counterintuitive result that the infinite number of points in a unit interval is the same <a class="uri" href="cardinality" title="wikilink">cardinality</a> as the infinite number of points in any finite-dimensional <a class="uri" href="manifold" title="wikilink">manifold</a>, such as the unit square. The problem Peano solved was whether such a mapping could be continuous; i.e., a curve that fills a space. Peano's solution does not set up a continuous <a href="one-to-one_correspondence" title="wikilink">one-to-one correspondence</a> between the unit interval and the unit square, and indeed such a correspondence does not exist (see below).</p>

</figure>
<p>It was common to associate the vague notions of <em>thinness</em> and 1-dimensionality to curves; all normally encountered curves were <a class="uri" href="piecewise" title="wikilink">piecewise</a> differentiable (that is, have piecewise continuous derivatives), and such curves cannot fill up the entire unit square. Therefore, Peano's space-filling curve was found to be highly counterintuitive.</p>
<p>From Peano's example, it was easy to deduce continuous curves whose ranges contained the <em>n</em>-dimensional <a class="uri" href="hypercube" title="wikilink">hypercube</a> (for any positive integer <em>n</em>). It was also easy to extend Peano's example to continuous curves without endpoints, which filled the entire <em>n</em>-dimensional Euclidean space (where <em>n</em> is 2, 3, or any other positive integer).</p>
<p>Most well-known space-filling curves are constructed iteratively as the limit of a sequence of <a href="piecewise_linear_function" title="wikilink">piecewise linear</a> continuous curves, each one more closely approximating the space-filling limit.</p>
<p>Peano's ground-breaking article contained no illustrations of his construction, which is defined in terms of <a href="ternary_expansion" title="wikilink">ternary expansions</a> and a <a href="mirroring_operator" title="wikilink">mirroring operator</a>. But the graphical construction was perfectly clear to him—he made an ornamental tiling showing a picture of the curve in his home in Turin. Peano's article also ends by observing that the technique can be obviously extended to other odd bases besides base 3. His choice to avoid any appeal to <a href="proof_without_words" title="wikilink">graphical visualization</a> was, no doubt, motivated by a desire for a well-founded, completely rigorous proof owing nothing to pictures. At that time (the beginning of the foundation of general topology), graphical arguments were still included in proofs, yet were becoming a hindrance to understanding often counterintuitive results.</p>
<p>A year later, <a href="David_Hilbert" title="wikilink">David Hilbert</a> published in the same journal a variation of Peano's construction. () Hilbert's article was the first to include a picture helping to visualize the construction technique, essentially the same as illustrated here. The analytic form of the <a href="Hilbert_curve" title="wikilink">Hilbert curve</a>, however, is more complicated than Peano's.</p>
<h2 id="outline-of-the-construction-of-a-space-filling-curve">Outline of the construction of a space-filling curve</h2>
<p>Let <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle \mathcal{C}$</span> denote the <a href="Cantor_space" title="wikilink">Cantor space</a> <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle \mathbf{2}^\mathbb{N}$</span>.</p>
<p>We start with a continuous function <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle h$</span> from the Cantor space <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle \mathcal{C}$</span> onto the entire unit interval <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle [0,\, 1]$</span>. (The restriction of the <a href="Cantor_function" title="wikilink">Cantor function</a> to the <a href="Cantor_set" title="wikilink">Cantor set</a> is an example of such a function.) From it, we get a continuous function <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle H$</span> from the topological product <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle \mathcal{C} \;\times\; \mathcal{C}$</span> onto the entire unit square <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle [0,\, 1] \;\times\; [0,\, 1]$</span> by setting</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$H(x,y) = (h(x), h(y)). \,$$</span></p>
<p>Since the Cantor set is <a class="uri" href="homeomorphic" title="wikilink">homeomorphic</a> to the product <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle \mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{C}$</span>, there is a continuous bijection <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle g$</span> from the Cantor set onto <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle \mathcal{C} \;\times\; \mathcal{C}$</span>. The composition <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle f$</span> of <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle H$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle g$</span> is a continuous function mapping the Cantor set onto the entire unit square. (Alternatively, we could use the theorem that every <a href="compact_set" title="wikilink">compact</a> metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set to get the function <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle f$</span>.)</p>
<p>Finally, one can extend <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle f$</span> to a continuous function <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle F$</span> whose domain is the entire unit interval <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle [0,\, 1]$</span>. This can be done either by using the <a href="Tietze_extension_theorem" title="wikilink">Tietze extension theorem</a> on each of the components of <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle f$</span>, or by simply extending <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle f$</span> "linearly" (that is, on each of the deleted open interval <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle (a,\, b)$</span> in the construction of the Cantor set, we define the extension part of <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle F$</span> on <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle (a,\, b)$</span> to be the line segment within the unit square joining the values <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle f(a)$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle f(b)$</span>).</p>
<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>
<p>If a curve is not injective, then one can find two intersecting <em>subcurves</em> of the curve, each obtained by considering the images of two disjoint segments from the curve's domain (the unit line segment). The two subcurves intersect if the <a href="intersection_(set_theory)" title="wikilink">intersection</a> of the two images is non-empty. One might be tempted to think that the meaning of <em>curves intersecting</em> is that they necessarily cross each other, like the intersection point of two non-parallel lines, from one side to the other. However, two curves (or two subcurves of one curve) may contact one another without crossing, as, for example, a line tangent to a circle does.</p>
<p>A non-self-intersecting continuous curve cannot fill the unit square because that will make the curve a <a class="uri" href="homeomorphism" title="wikilink">homeomorphism</a> from the unit interval onto the unit square (any continuous <a class="uri" href="bijection" title="wikilink">bijection</a> from a <a href="compact_space" title="wikilink">compact space</a> onto a <a href="Hausdorff_space" title="wikilink">Hausdorff space</a> is a homeomorphism). But a unit square has no <a class="uri" href="cut-point" title="wikilink">cut-point</a>, and so cannot be homeomorphic to the unit interval, in which all points except the endpoints are cut-points.</p>
<p>For the classic Peano and Hilbert space-filling curves, where two subcurves intersect (in the technical sense), there is self-contact without self-crossing. A space-filling curve can be (everywhere) self-crossing if its approximation curves are self-crossing. A space-filling curve's approximations can be self-avoiding, as the figures above illustrate. In 3 dimensions, self-avoiding approximation curves can even contain <a href="knot_theory" title="wikilink">knots</a>. Approximation curves remain within a bounded portion of <em>n</em>-dimensional space, but their lengths increase without bound.</p>
<p>Space-filling curves are special cases of <a class="uri" href="fractal" title="wikilink">fractal</a> constructions. No differentiable space-filling curve can exist. Roughly speaking, differentiability puts a bound on how fast the curve can turn.</p>
<h2 id="the-hahnmazurkiewicz-theorem">The Hahn–Mazurkiewicz theorem</h2>
<p>The <a href="Hans_Hahn_(mathematician)" title="wikilink">Hahn</a>–<a href="Stefan_Mazurkiewicz" title="wikilink">Mazurkiewicz</a> theorem is the following characterization of spaces that are the continuous image of curves:</p>
<dl>
<dd>A non-empty Hausdorff topological space is a continuous image of the unit interval if and only if it is a compact, <a href="connected_space" title="wikilink">connected</a>, <a href="locally_connected" title="wikilink">locally connected</a> <a href="second-countable_space" title="wikilink">second-countable space</a>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Spaces that are the continuous image of a unit interval are sometimes called <em>Peano spaces</em>.</p>
<p>In many formulations of the Hahn–Mazurkiewicz theorem, <em>second-countable</em> is replaced by <em>metrizable</em>. These two formulations are equivalent. In one direction a compact <a href="Hausdorff_space" title="wikilink">Hausdorff space</a> is a <a href="normal_space" title="wikilink">normal space</a> and, by the <a href="Pavel_Samuilovich_Urysohn" title="wikilink">Urysohn</a> <a href="metrization_theorem" title="wikilink">metrization theorem</a>, second-countable then implies metrizable. Conversely a compact metric space is second-countable.</p>
<h2 id="kleinian-groups">Kleinian groups</h2>
<p>There are many natural examples of space-filling, or rather sphere-filling, curves in the theory of doubly degenerate <a href="Kleinian_group" title="wikilink">Kleinian groups</a>. For example,  showed that the circle at infinity of the <a href="universal_cover" title="wikilink">universal cover</a> of a fiber of a <a href="mapping_torus" title="wikilink">mapping torus</a> of a <a href="pseudo-Anosov_map" title="wikilink">pseudo-Anosov map</a> is a sphere-filling curve. (Here the sphere is the sphere at infinity of <a href="hyperbolic_space" title="wikilink">hyperbolic 3-space</a>.)</p>
<h2 id="integration">Integration</h2>
<p>Wiener pointed out that space filling curves could be used to reduce Lebesgue integration in higher dimensions to Lebesgue integration in one dimension.</p>
