<h1>Inaccessible cardinal</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In <a href="set_theory" title="wikilink">set theory</a>, an <a href="uncountable_set" title="wikilink">uncountable</a> <a href="regular_cardinal" title="wikilink">regular cardinal number</a> is called <strong>weakly inaccessible</strong> if it is a weak <strong><a href="limit_cardinal" title="wikilink">limit cardinal</a></strong>, and <strong>strongly inaccessible</strong>, or just <strong>inaccessible</strong>, if it is a strong limit cardinal. Some authors do not require weakly and strongly inaccessible cardinals to be uncountable (in which case <span class="LaTeX">$\aleph_0$</span> is strongly inaccessible). Weakly inaccessible cardinals were introduced by , and strongly inaccessible ones by  and .</p>
<p>The term "inaccessible cardinal" is ambiguous. Until about 1950 it meant "weakly inaccessible cardinal", but since then it usually means "strongly inaccessible cardinal".</p>
<p>Every strongly inaccessible cardinal is also weakly inaccessible, as every strong limit cardinal is also a weak limit cardinal. If the <a href="Continuum_hypothesis#The_generalized_continuum_hypothesis" title="wikilink">generalized continuum hypothesis</a> holds, then a cardinal is strongly inaccessible if and only if it is weakly inaccessible.</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$\aleph_0$</span> (<a href="aleph_number" title="wikilink">aleph-null</a>) is a regular strong limit cardinal. Assuming the <a href="axiom_of_choice" title="wikilink">axiom of choice</a>, every other infinite cardinal number is either regular or a (weak) limit. However, only a rather large cardinal number can be both and thus weakly inaccessible.</p>
<p>An <a href="ordinal_number" title="wikilink">ordinal</a> is a weakly inaccessible cardinal if and only if it is a regular ordinal and it is a limit of regular ordinals. (Zero, one, and <span class="LaTeX">$\aleph_0$</span> are regular ordinals, but not limits of regular ordinals.) A cardinal which is weakly inaccessible and also a strong limit cardinal is strongly inaccessible.</p>
<p>The assumption of the existence of a strongly inaccessible cardinal is sometimes applied in the form of the assumption that one can work inside a <a href="Grothendieck_universe" title="wikilink">Grothendieck universe</a>, the two ideas being intimately connected.</p>
<h2 id="models-and-consistency">Models and consistency</h2>
<p><a class="uri" href="ZFC" title="wikilink">ZFC</a> implies that the <em>V</em><sub>κ</sub> is a <a href="model_theory" title="wikilink">model</a> of ZFC whenever κ is strongly inaccessible. And ZF implies that the <a href="Gödel_universe" title="wikilink">Gödel universe</a> <em>L</em><sub>κ</sub> is a model of ZFC whenever κ is weakly inaccessible. Thus ZF together with "there exists a weakly inaccessible cardinal" implies that ZFC is consistent. Therefore, inaccessible cardinals are a type of <a href="large_cardinal" title="wikilink">large cardinal</a>.</p>
<p>If <em>V</em> is a standard model of ZFC and κ is an inaccessible in <em>V</em>, then: <em>V</em><sub>κ</sub> is one of the intended models of <a href="Zermelo–Fraenkel_set_theory" title="wikilink">Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory</a>; and Def (<em>V</em><sub>κ</sub>) is one of the intended models of <a href="Von_Neumann–Bernays–Gödel_set_theory" title="wikilink">Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory</a>; and <em>V</em><sub>κ+1</sub> is one of the intended models of <a href="Morse–Kelley_set_theory" title="wikilink">Morse–Kelley set theory</a>. Here Def (<em>X</em>) is the Δ<sub>0</sub> definable subsets of <em>X</em> (see <a href="constructible_universe" title="wikilink">constructible universe</a>). However, κ does not need to be inaccessible, or even a cardinal number, in order for <em>V</em><sub>κ</sub> to be a standard model of ZF (see <a href="Inaccessible_cardinal#Two_model-theoretic_characterisations_of_inaccessibility" title="wikilink">below</a>).</p>
<p>Suppose V is a model of ZFC. Either V contains no strong inaccessible or, taking κ to be the smallest strong inaccessible in V, <em>V</em><sub>κ</sub> is a standard model of ZFC which contains no strong inaccessibles. Thus, the consistency of ZFC implies consistency of ZFC+"there are no strong inaccessibles". Similarly, either V contains no weak inaccessible or, taking κ to be the smallest ordinal which is weakly inaccessible relative to any standard sub-model of V, then <em>L</em><sub>κ</sub> is a standard model of ZFC which contains no weak inaccessibles. So consistency of <a href="Zermelo-Fraenkel_set_theory" title="wikilink">ZFC</a> implies consistency of ZFC+"there are no weak inaccessibles". This shows that ZFC cannot prove the existence of an inaccessible cardinal, so ZFC is consistent with the non-existence of any inaccessible cardinals.</p>
<p>The issue whether ZFC is consistent with the existence of an inaccessible cardinal is more subtle. The proof sketched in the previous paragraph that the consistency of ZFC + "there is an inaccessible cardinal" implies the consistency of ZFC + "there is not an inaccessible cardinal" can be formalized in ZFC. However, assuming that ZFC is consistent, no proof that the consistency of ZFC implies the consistency of ZFC + "there is an inaccessible cardinal" can be formalized in ZFC. This follows from <a href="Gödel's_second_incompleteness_theorem" title="wikilink">Gödel's second incompleteness theorem</a>, which shows that if ZFC + "there is an inaccessible cardinal" is consistent, then it cannot prove its own consistency. Because ZFC + "there is an inaccessible cardinal" does prove the consistency of ZFC, if ZFC proved that its own consistency implies the consistency of ZFC + "there is an inaccessible cardinal" then this latter theory would be able to prove its own consistency, which is impossible if it is consistent.</p>
<p>There are arguments for the existence of inaccessible cardinals that cannot be formalized in ZFC. One such argument, presented by , is that the class of all ordinals of a particular model <em>M</em> of set theory would itself be an inaccessible cardinal if there was a larger model of set theory extending <em>M</em>.</p>
<h2 id="existence-of-a-proper-class-of-inaccessibles">Existence of a proper class of inaccessibles</h2>
<p>There are many important axioms in set theory which assert the existence of a proper class of cardinals which satisfy a predicate of interest. In the case of inaccessibility, the corresponding axiom is the assertion that for every cardinal μ, there is an inaccessible cardinal κ which is strictly larger, μ 0(λ) the λ<sup>th</sup> inaccessible cardinal, then the fixed points of ψ<sub>0</sub> are the 1-inaccessible cardinals. Then letting ψ<sub>β</sub>(λ) be the λ<sup>th</sup> β-inaccessible cardinal, the fixed points of ψ<sub>β</sub> are the (β+1)-inaccessible cardinals (the values ψ<sub>β+1</sub>(λ)). If α is a limit ordinal, an α-inaccessible is a fixed point of every ψ<sub>β</sub> for β α(λ) is the λ<sup>th</sup> such cardinal). This process of taking fixed points of functions generating successively larger cardinals is commonly encountered in the study of <a href="List_of_large_cardinal_properties" title="wikilink">large cardinal numbers</a>.</p>
<p>The term <strong>hyper-inaccessible</strong> is ambiguous. Some authors use it to mean 1-inaccessible, though this use is rare. Most authors use it to mean that κ is κ-inaccessible. (It can never be κ+1-inaccessible.)</p>
<p>For any ordinal α, a cardinal κ is <strong>α-hyper-inaccessible</strong> if and only if κ is hyper-inaccessible and for every ordinal β κ, there exists α (V_\alpha,\in,U\cap V_\alpha) is an <a href="elementary_substructure" title="wikilink">elementary substructure</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$(V_\kappa,\in,U)$</span>. (In fact, the set of such α is <a href="Club_set" title="wikilink">closed unbounded</a> in κ.) Equivalently, κ is <span class="LaTeX">$\Pi_n^0$</span>-<a href="Totally_indescribable_cardinal" title="wikilink">indescribable</a> for all n ≥ 0.</p>
<p>It is provable in ZF that ∞ satisfies a somewhat weaker reflection property, where the substructure (V<sub>α</sub>, ∈, U ∩ V<sub>α</sub>) is only required to be 'elementary' with respect to a finite set of formulas. Ultimately, the reason for this weakening is that whereas the model-theoretic satisfaction relation <span class="LaTeX">$\models$</span> can be defined, truth itself cannot, due to <a href="Tarski's_undefinability_theorem" title="wikilink">Tarski's theorem</a>.</p>
<p>Secondly, under ZFC it can be shown that κ is inaccessible if and only if (V<sub>κ</sub>, ∈) is a model of <a href="Second_order_logic" title="wikilink">second order</a> ZFC.</p>
<p>In this case, by the reflection property above, there exists α α, ∈) is a standard model of (<a href="First_order_logic" title="wikilink">first order</a>) ZFC. Hence, the existence of an inaccessible cardinal is a stronger hypothesis than the existence of a standard model of ZFC.</p>
