<p>Graphene has many extraordinary properties. It is about 200 times stronger than steel by weight,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> conducts heat and electricity with great efficiency and is nearly transparent.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Researchers have identified the <a href="Bipolar_junction_transistor" title="wikilink">bipolar transistor</a> effect, <a href="ballistic_transport" title="wikilink">ballistic transport</a> of charges and large quantum oscillations in the material.</p>

<p>Scientists have theorized about graphene for decades. It is quite likely that graphene was unwittingly produced in small quantities for centuries through the use of pencils and other similar applications of graphite, but it was first measurably produced and isolated in the lab in 2003.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Research was informed by existing theoretical descriptions of its composition, structure and properties.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> High-quality graphene proved to be surprisingly easy to isolate, making more research possible.</p>

<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>

<p>"Graphene" is a combination of graphite and the suffix <a class="uri" href="-ene" title="wikilink">-ene</a>, named by <a href="Hanns-Peter_Boehm" title="wikilink">Hanns-Peter Boehm</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> who described single-layer carbon foils in 1962.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>The term <em>graphene</em> first appeared in 1987<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> to describe single sheets of graphite as a constituent of <a href="graphite_intercalation_compound" title="wikilink">graphite intercalation compounds</a> (GICs); conceptually a GIC is a crystalline salt of the intercalant and graphene. The term was also used in early descriptions of <a href="carbon_nanotube" title="wikilink">carbon nanotubes</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> as well as for <a class="uri" href="epitaxial" title="wikilink">epitaxial</a> graphene<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Graphene can be considered an "infinite alternant" (only six-member <a href="carbon_ring" title="wikilink">carbon ring</a>) <a href="polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon" title="wikilink">polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon</a> (PAH).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>The <a href="International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry" title="wikilink">IUPAC</a> compendium of technology states: "previously, descriptions such as graphite layers, carbon layers, or carbon sheets have been used for the term graphene... it is incorrect to use for a single layer a term which includes the term graphite, which would imply a three-dimensional structure. The term graphene should be used only when the reactions, structural relations or other properties of individual layers are discussed."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>Geim defined "isolated or free-standing graphene" as "graphene is a single atomic plane of graphite, which – and this is essential – is sufficiently isolated from its environment to be considered free-standing."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> This definition is narrower than the IUPAC definition and refers to cloven, transferred, and suspended graphene. Other forms of graphene, such as graphene grown on various metals, can become free-standing if, for example, suspended or transferred to <a href="silicon_dioxide" title="wikilink">silicon dioxide</a> () or <a href="silicon_carbide" title="wikilink">silicon carbide</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

Donated to the Nobel Museum in Stockholm by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov in 2010."></embed>  In 1859 <a href="Sir_Benjamin_Collins_Brodie,_2nd_Baronet" title="wikilink">Benjamin Collins Brodie</a> was aware of the highly <a href="Lamella_(materials)" title="wikilink">lamellar</a> structure of thermally reduced <a href="graphite_oxide" title="wikilink">graphite oxide</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>The structure of graphite was solved in 1916<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> by the related method of <a href="powder_diffraction" title="wikilink">powder diffraction</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> It was studied in detail by V. Kohlschütter and P. Haenni in 1918, who also described the properties of <a href="graphene_oxide_paper" title="wikilink">graphite oxide paper</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Its structure was determined from single-crystal diffraction in 1924.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>The theory of graphene was first explored by <a href="P._R._Wallace" title="wikilink">P. R. Wallace</a> in 1947 as a starting point for understanding the electronic properties of 3D graphite. The emergent massless Dirac equation was first pointed out by <a href="Gordon_Walter_Semenoff" title="wikilink">Gordon Walter Semenoff</a> and David P. DeVincenzo and Eugene J. Mele.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Semenoff emphasized the occurrence in a magnetic field of an electronic <a href="Landau_level" title="wikilink">Landau level</a> precisely at the Dirac point. This level is responsible for the anomalous integer quantum Hall effect.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p>The earliest TEM images of few-layer graphite were published by G. Ruess and F. Vogt in 1948.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Later, single graphene layers were also observed directly by electron microscopy.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Before 2004 intercalated graphite compounds were studied under a <a href="Transmission_electron_microscopy" title="wikilink">transmission electron microscope</a> (TEM). Researchers occasionally observed thin graphitic flakes ("few-layer graphene") and possibly even individual layers. An early, detailed study on few-layer graphite dates to 1962.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><mtpl></mtpl></p>

<p>Starting in the 1970s single layers of graphite were grown epitaxially on top of other materials.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> This "epitaxial graphene" consists of a single-atom-thick hexagonal lattice of <a href="sp2_bond" title="wikilink">sp<sup>2</sup>-bonded</a> carbon atoms, as in free-standing graphene. However, there is significant charge transfer from the substrate to the epitaxial graphene, and, in some cases, hybridization between the <a href="d-orbital" title="wikilink">d-orbitals</a> of the substrate atoms and <a href="Pi_orbital" title="wikilink">π orbitals</a> of graphene, which significantly alters the electronic structure of epitaxial graphene.</p>

<p>Single layers of graphite were also observed by <a href="transmission_electron_microscopy" title="wikilink">transmission electron microscopy</a> within bulk materials, in particular inside soot obtained by chemical exfoliation. Efforts to make thin films of graphite by mechanical exfoliation started in 1990,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> but nothing thinner than 50 to 100 layers was produced before 2004.</p>

<p>Initial attempts to make atomically thin graphitic films employed exfoliation techniques similar to the drawing method. Multilayer samples down to 10 nm in thickness were obtained. Old papers were unearthed<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> in which researchers tried to isolate graphene starting with intercalated compounds. These papers reported the observation of very thin graphitic fragments (possibly monolayers) by transmission electron microscopy. Neither of the earlier observations was sufficient to "spark the graphene gold rush," which awaited macroscopic samples of extracted atomic planes.</p>

<p>One of the very first patents pertaining to the production of graphene was filed in October 2002 and granted in 2006 (US Pat. 7071258).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Titled, "Nano-scaled Graphene Plates," this patent detailed one of the very first large scale graphene production processes. Two years later, in 2004 <a href="Andre_Geim" title="wikilink">Andre Geim</a> and <a href="Kostya_Novoselov" title="wikilink">Kostya Novoselov</a> at <a href="The_University_of_Manchester" title="wikilink">The University of Manchester</a> extracted single-atom-thick crystallites from bulk graphite.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> They pulled graphene layers from graphite and transferred them onto thin  on a silicon wafer in a process called either micromechanical cleavage or the <a href="Scotch_tape" title="wikilink">Scotch tape</a> technique.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The  electrically isolated the graphene and weakly interacted with it, providing nearly charge-neutral graphene layers. The silicon beneath the  could be used as a "back gate" electrode to vary the charge density in the graphene over a wide range. They may not have been the first to use this technique— , filed in 2002, describes how to process commercially available flexible expanded graphite to achieve a graphite thickness of 0.01 thousandth of an inch. The key to success was high-throughput visual recognition of graphene on a properly chosen substrate, which provides a small but noticeable optical contrast.</p>

<p>The cleavage technique led directly to the first observation of the anomalous quantum Hall effect in graphene,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> which provided direct evidence of graphene's theoretically predicted <a href="Berry's_phase" title="wikilink">Berry's phase</a> of massless <a href="Dirac_fermion" title="wikilink">Dirac fermions</a>. The effect was reported soon after by <a href="Philip_Kim" title="wikilink">Philip Kim</a> and Yuanbo Zhang in 2005. These experiments started after the researchers observed colleagues who were looking for the quantum Hall effect<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> and Dirac fermions<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> in bulk graphite.</p>

<p>Even though graphene on nickel and on silicon carbide have both existed in the laboratory for decades, graphene mechanically exfoliated on  provided the first proof of the Dirac fermion nature of electrons.</p>

<p>Geim and Novoselov received several awards for their pioneering research on graphene, notably the 2010 <a href="Nobel_Prize_in_Physics" title="wikilink">Nobel Prize in Physics</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p>In 2014 a £60m <a href="National_Graphene_Institute" title="wikilink">National Graphene Institute</a> a £60m Graphene Engineering Innovation Centre (GEIC) were announced to support applied research and development in partnership with other research organisations and industry.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>In <a href="North_East_England" title="wikilink">North East England</a> two commercial manufacturers, Applied Graphene Materials<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> and Thomas Swan Limited,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> (with Trinity College, Dublin researchers)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> have begun manufacturing.

<p>Graphene has a theoretical <a href="specific_surface_area" title="wikilink">specific surface area</a> (SSA) of . This is much larger than that reported to date for carbon black (typically smaller than ) or for carbon nanotubes (CNTs), from ≈100 to  and is similar to <a href="activated_carbon" title="wikilink">activated carbon</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>

<p> Graphene is a <a href="crystal" title="wikilink">crystalline</a> <a class="uri" href="allotrope" title="wikilink">allotrope</a> of carbon with 2-dimensional properties. Its carbon atoms are densely packed in a regular <a href="chicken_wire_(chemistry)" title="wikilink">atomic-scale chicken wire</a> (<a href="Hexagonal_tiling" title="wikilink">hexagonal</a>) pattern.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p>Each atom has four bonds, one σ bond with each of its three neighbors and one π-bond that is oriented out of plane. The atoms are about 1.42 Å apart.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>

<p>Graphene's hexagonal lattice can be regarded as two interleaving triangular lattices. This perspective was successfully used to calculate the band structure for a single graphite layer using a tight-binding approximation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

<p>Graphene's stability is due to its tightly packed carbon atoms and an sp<sup>2</sup> <a href="orbital_hybridization" title="wikilink">orbital hybridization</a> – a combination of orbitals s, p<sub>x</sub> and p<sub>y</sub> that constitute the σ-bond. The final p<sub>z</sub> electron makes up the π-bond. The π-bonds hybridize together to form the π-band and π∗-bands. These bands are responsible for most of graphene's notable electronic properties, via the half-filled band that permits free-moving electrons.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<p>Graphene sheets in solid form usually show evidence in diffraction for graphite's (002) layering. This is true of some single-walled nanostructures.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> However, unlayered graphene with only (hk0) rings has been found in the core of <a href="presolar_grains" title="wikilink">presolar</a> graphite onions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> TEM studies show faceting at defects in flat graphene sheets<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> and suggest a role for two-dimensional crystallization from a melt.</p>

<p>Graphene can self-repair holes in its sheets, when exposed to molecules containing carbon, such as <a href="hydrocarbon" title="wikilink">hydrocarbons</a>. Bombarded with pure carbon atoms, the atoms perfectly align into <a href="hexagon" title="wikilink">hexagons</a>, completely filling the holes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>

<p>The <a href="atomic_structure" title="wikilink">atomic structure</a> of isolated, single-layer graphene was studied by <a href="transmission_electron_microscope" title="wikilink">transmission electron microscopy</a> (TEM) on sheets of graphene suspended between bars of a metallic grid.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Electron diffraction patterns showed the expected honeycomb lattice. Suspended graphene also showed "rippling" of the flat sheet, with amplitude of about one nanometer. These ripples may be intrinsic to the material as a result of the instability of two-dimensional crystals,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> or may originate from the ubiquitous dirt seen in all TEM images of graphene. Atomic resolution real-space images of isolated, single-layer graphene on  substrates are available<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> via <a href="scanning_tunneling_microscope" title="wikilink">scanning tunneling microscopy</a>. <a class="uri" href="Photoresist" title="wikilink">Photoresist</a> residue, which must be removed to obtain atomic-resolution images, may be the "<a href="adsorbate" title="wikilink">adsorbates</a>" observed in TEM images, and may explain the observed rippling. Rippling on  is caused by conformation of graphene to the underlying , and is not intrinsic.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="chemical">Chemical</h3>

<p>Graphene is the only form of carbon (or solid material) in which every atom is available for chemical reaction from two sides (due to the 2D structure). Atoms at the edges of a graphene sheet have special chemical reactivity. Graphene has the highest ratio of edge atoms of any allotrope. Defects within a sheet increase its chemical reactivity.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> The onset temperature of reaction between the basal plane of single-layer graphene and oxygen gas is below .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Graphene burns at very low temperature (e.g., ).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Graphene is commonly modified with oxygen- and nitrogen-containing functional groups and analyzed by infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. However, determination of structures of graphene with oxygen-<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> and nitrogen-<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> functional groups requires the structures to be well controlled.</p>

<p>In 2013, <a href="Stanford_University" title="wikilink">Stanford University</a> physicists reported that single-layer graphene is a hundred times more chemically reactive than thicker sheets.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<p>Experimental results from transport measurements show that graphene has a remarkable <a href="electron_mobility" title="wikilink">electron mobility</a> at room temperature, with reported values in excess of <mtpl></mtpl>. Additionally, the symmetry of the experimentally measured conductance indicates that hole and electron mobilities should be nearly the same.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn81" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> The mobility is nearly independent of temperature between  and ,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn82" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn83" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn84" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> which implies that the dominant scattering mechanism is <a href="defect_scattering" title="wikilink">defect scattering</a>. Scattering by the acoustic <a href="phonon" title="wikilink">phonons</a> of graphene intrinsically limits room temperature mobility to <mtpl></mtpl> at a carrier density of <mtpl></mtpl>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn85" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn86" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> which was later demonstrated and is  times greater than copper.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn87" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>

<p>The corresponding <a class="uri" href="resistivity" title="wikilink">resistivity</a> of the graphene sheet would be . This is less than the resistivity of <a class="uri" href="silver" title="wikilink">silver</a>, the lowest known at room temperature.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn88" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> However, for room temperature graphene on  substrates, scattering of electrons by optical phonons of the substrate is a larger effect than scattering by graphene’s own phonons. This limits mobility to <mtpl></mtpl>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn89" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>

<p>Charge transport in graphene in ambient has major concerns due to adsorption of contamination such as water, oxygen, humid, etc. molecules. This leads to non-repetitive and large hysteresis I-V characteristics. Hence researchers carry out electrical measurements in vacuum. The protection of graphene surface by a coating with materials such as SiN, PMMA, h-BN, etc. have been discussed by researchers, but with limited success. In January 2015, first long term stable graphene device operation in air over several weeks has been reported by German researchers,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn90" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn91" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> where graphene surface is protected by aluminum oxide.</p>

<p>Electrical resistance in 40-nanometer-wide <a href="nanoribbon" title="wikilink">nanoribbons</a> of epitaxial graphene changes in discrete steps. The ribbons' conductance exceeds predictions by a factor of 10. The ribbons can act more like <a href="optical_waveguide" title="wikilink">optical waveguides</a> or <a href="quantum_dot" title="wikilink">quantum dots</a>, allowing electrons to flow smoothly along the ribbon edges. In copper, resistance increases in proportion to length as electrons encounter impurities.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn92" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn93" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>

<p>Transport is dominated by two modes. One is ballistic and temperature independent, while the other is thermally activated. Ballistic electrons resemble those in cylindrical <a href="carbon_nanotube" title="wikilink">carbon nanotubes</a>. At room temperature, resistance increases abruptly at a particular length—the ballistic mode at 16 micrometres and the other at 160 nanometres (1% of the former length).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn94" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>

<p>The ribbons were grown on the edges of three-dimensional structures etched into <a href="silicon_carbide" title="wikilink">silicon carbide</a> wafers. When the wafers are heated to approximately , silicon is preferentially driven off along the edges, forming nanoribbons whose structure is determined by the pattern of the three-dimensional surface. The nanoribbons had perfectly smooth edges, annealed by the fabrication process. Electron mobility measurements surpassing one million correspond to a <a href="sheet_resistance" title="wikilink">sheet resistance</a> of one ohm per square— two orders of magnitude lower than in two-dimensional graphene.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn95" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>

<p>The <a href="Casimir_effect" title="wikilink">Casimir effect</a> is an interaction between disjoint neutral bodies provoked by the fluctuations of the electrodynamical vacuum. Mathematically it can be explained by considering the normal modes of electromagnetic fields, which explicitly depend on the boundary (or matching) conditions on the interacting bodies' surfaces. Since graphene/electromagnetic field interaction is strong for a one-atom-thick material, the Casimir effect is of growing interest.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn126" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn127" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="massive-electrons">"Massive" electrons</h3>

<p>Graphene's unit cell has two identical carbon atoms and two zero-energy states: one in which the electron resides on atom A, the other in which the electron resides on atom B. Both states exist at exactly zero energy. However, if the two atoms in the unit cell are not identical, the situation changes. Hunt et al. show that placing <a href="Boron_nitride" title="wikilink">hexagonal boron nitride</a> (h-BN) in contact with graphene can alter the potential felt at atom A versus atom B enough that the electrons develop a mass and accompanying band gap of about 30 meV.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn129" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>

<p>The mass can be positive or negative. An arrangement that slightly raises the energy of an electron on atom A relative to atom B gives it a positive mass, while an arrangement that raises the energy of atom B produces a negative electron mass. The two versions behave alike and are indistinguishable via <a href="optical_spectroscopy" title="wikilink">optical spectroscopy</a>. An electron traveling from a positive-mass region to a negative-mass region must cross an intermediate region where its mass once again becomes zero. This region is gapless and therefore metallic. Metallic modes bounding semiconducting regions of opposite-sign mass is a hallmark of a topological phase and display much the same physics as topological insulators.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn130" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a></p>

<p>If the mass in graphene can be controlled, electrons can be confined to massless regions by surrounding them with massive regions, allowing the patterning of <a href="quantum_dot" title="wikilink">quantum dots</a>, wires, and other mesoscopic structures. It also produces one-dimensional conductors along the boundary.

<p>Such unique absorption could become saturated when the input optical intensity is above a threshold value.

Graphene can be saturated readily under strong excitation over the visible to <a class="uri" href="near-infrared" title="wikilink">near-infrared</a> region, due to the universal optical absorption and zero band gap.

Due to this special property, graphene has wide application in ultrafast <a class="uri" href="photonics" title="wikilink">photonics</a>.

<p>Thermal transport in graphene is an active area of research, which has attracted attention because of the potential for thermal management applications.

<p>It has been suggested that the isotopic composition, the ratio of <a href="Carbon-12" title="wikilink"><sup>12</sup>C</a> to <a href="Carbon-13" title="wikilink"><sup>13</sup>C</a>, has a significant impact on the thermal conductivity. For example, isotopically pure <sup>12</sup>C graphene has higher thermal conductivity than either a 50:50 isotope ratio or the naturally occurring 99:1 ratio.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn164" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> It can be shown by using the <a href="Wiedemann–Franz_law" title="wikilink">Wiedemann–Franz law</a>, that the thermal conduction is <a class="uri" href="phonon" title="wikilink">phonon</a>-dominated.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn165" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> However, for a gated graphene strip, an applied gate bias causing a <a href="Fermi_energy" title="wikilink">Fermi energy</a> shift much larger than <em>k</em><sub>B</sub><em>T</em> can cause the electronic contribution to increase and dominate over the <a class="uri" href="phonon" title="wikilink">phonon</a> contribution at low temperatures.

The lowest negative Grüneisen parameters correspond to the lowest transverse acoustic ZA modes. Phonon frequencies for such modes increase with the in-plane <a href="lattice_parameter" title="wikilink">lattice parameter</a> since atoms in the layer upon stretching will be less free to move in the z direction. This is similar to the behavior of a string, which, when it is stretched, will have vibrations of smaller amplitude and higher frequency.

<p>The <a href="spring_constant" title="wikilink">spring constant</a> of suspended graphene sheets has been measured using an <a href="atomic_force_microscope" title="wikilink">atomic force microscope</a> (AFM). Graphene sheets were suspended over  cavities where an AFM tip was used to apply a stress to the sheet to test its mechanical properties. Its spring constant was in the range 1–5 N/m and the stiffness was , which differs from that of bulk graphite. These intrinsic properties could lead to applications such as <a href="Nanoelectromechanical_systems" title="wikilink">NEMS</a> as pressure sensors and resonators.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn177" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a></p>

<p>Due to its large surface energy and out of plane ductility, flat graphene sheets are unstable with respect to scrolling, i.e. bending into a cylindrical shape, which is its lower-energy state.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn178" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a></p>

<p>As is true of all materials, regions of graphene are subject to thermal and quantum fluctuations in relative displacement. Although the amplitude of these fluctuations is bounded in 3D structures (even in the limit of infinite size), the <a href="Mermin–Wagner_theorem" title="wikilink">Mermin–Wagner theorem</a> shows that the amplitude of long-wavelength fluctuations grows logarithmically with the scale of a 2D structure, and would therefore be unbounded in structures of infinite size. Local deformation and elastic strain are negligibly affected by this long-range divergence in relative displacement. It is believed that a sufficiently large 2D structure, in the absence of applied lateral tension, will bend and crumple to form a fluctuating 3D structure. Researchers have observed ripples in suspended layers of graphene,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn179" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> and it has been proposed that the ripples are caused by thermal fluctuations in the material. As a consequence of these dynamical deformations, it is debatable whether graphene is truly a 2D structure.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn180" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn181" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn182" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> It has recently been shown that these ripples, if amplified through the introduction of vacancy defects, can impart a negative <a href="Poisson's_ratio" title="wikilink">Poisson's ratio</a> into graphene, resulting in the thinnest <a class="uri" href="auxetic" title="wikilink">auxetic</a> material known so far.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn183" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a></p>

In all cases, the graphite must bond to some substrate to retain its 2d shape.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn225" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="exfoliation">Exfoliation</h3>

<p>As of 2014 exfoliation produced graphene with the lowest number of defects and highest electron mobility.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn226" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="adhesive-tape">Adhesive tape</h4>

<p>Cleavage is also known as <a href="Exfoliation_joint" title="wikilink">exfoliation</a>. Achieving single layers typically requires multiple exfoliation steps, each producing a slice with fewer layers, until only one remains. Geim and Novoselov used <a href="adhesive_tape" title="wikilink">adhesive tape</a> to split their graphene. Residues from the use of <a href="adhesive_tape" title="wikilink">adhesive tape</a> might contaminate the graphene flake.</p>

<p>After exfoliation the flakes are deposited on a silicon wafer using "dry deposition." Crystallites larger than 1 mm and visible to the naked eye can be obtained with the technique. It is often referred to as a "<a href="scotch_tape" title="wikilink">scotch tape</a>" or "drawing" method. The latter name appeared because the dry deposition resembles drawing with a piece of graphite.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn227" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="wedge-based-mechanical-exfoliation">Wedge-based mechanical exfoliation</h4>

<p>Another controlled technique to produce few layers of graphene uses a wedge type of tool<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn228" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a> to address difficulties of the adhesive tape method. In this method, a <a href="Wedge_based_mechanical_exfoliation" title="wikilink">sharp single-crystal diamond wedge</a> penetrates onto the graphite source to exfoliate layers. This method uses highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) as the starting material. The experiments were supported by molecular dynamic simulations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn229" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="reduction-of-graphite-oxide">Reduction of graphite oxide</h4>

<p><a href="Graphite_oxide" title="wikilink">Graphite oxide</a> reduction was probably the first method of graphene synthesis. P. Boehm reported producing monolayer flakes of reduced graphene oxide in 1962.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn230" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a> Geim acknowledged Boehm's contribution.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn231" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a> Rapid heating of graphite oxide and exfoliation yields highly dispersed carbon powder with a few percent of graphene flakes. Reduction of graphite oxide monolayer films, e.g. by <a class="uri" href="hydrazine" title="wikilink">hydrazine</a> with <a href="annealing_(metallurgy)" title="wikilink">annealing</a> in <a class="uri" href="argon" title="wikilink">argon</a>/<a class="uri" href="hydrogen" title="wikilink">hydrogen</a>, was reported to yield graphene films. However, the quality is lower compared to scotch-tape graphene, due to incomplete removal of <a href="functional_group" title="wikilink">functional groups</a>. Furthermore, the <a class="uri" href="oxidation" title="wikilink">oxidation</a> protocol introduces permanent defects due to over-oxidation. The oxidation protocol was enhanced to yield <a href="graphene_oxide" title="wikilink">graphene oxide</a> with an almost intact carbon framework that allows efficient removal of functional groups.

<h4 id="sugar-method">Sugar method</h4>

<p>Graphene has also been prepared by using a sole sugar(e.g. glucose, fructose, sucrose etc. ), this substrate-free "bottom-up" synthesis method is known as "Tang-Lau method" in which the sole source is sugar, the process is safer, simpler, and more environmentally friendly compared to traditionally “top-down” method. Another important advantage of Tang-Lau method is control of thickness, ranging from monolayer to multilayers by adjusting growth parameters.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn235" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="shearing">Shearing</h4>

<p>In 2014 defect-free, unoxidized graphene-containing liquids were made from graphite using mixers that produce local shear rates greater than . Commercial graphene products using the output were announced. The method was claimed to be applicable to <a href="boron_nitride" title="wikilink">boron nitride</a>, <a href="Molybdenum_disulfide" title="wikilink">Molybdenum disulfide</a> and other layered crystals.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn236" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn237" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="sonication">Sonication</h4>

<p>Applying a layer of graphite oxide film to a <a class="uri" href="DVD" title="wikilink">DVD</a> and burning it in a DVD writer produced a thin graphene film with high electrical conductivity (1738 siemens per meter) and specific surface area (1520 square meters per gram) that was highly resistant and malleable.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn238" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="solvent-aided">Solvent-aided</h5>

<p>Dispersing graphite in a proper liquid medium can produce graphene by <a class="uri" href="sonication" title="wikilink">sonication</a>. Graphene is separated from graphite by <a class="uri" href="centrifugation" title="wikilink">centrifugation</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn239" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a> producing graphene concentrations initially up to  in <a class="uri" href="N-methylpyrrolidone" title="wikilink">N-methylpyrrolidone</a> (NMP) and later to  in NMP,.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn240" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a> Using a suitable <a href="ionic_liquid" title="wikilink">ionic liquid</a> as the dispersing liquid medium produced concentrations of .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn241" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a> Graphene concentration produced by this method is very low, because nothing prevents the sheets from restacking due to van der Waals forces. The maximum concentrations achieved are the points at which the van der Waals forces overcome the interactive forces between the graphene sheets and the solvent molecules.</p>
<h5 id="solventsurfactant-aided">Solvent/surfactant-aided</h5>

<p>Adding a <a class="uri" href="surfactant" title="wikilink">surfactant</a> to a solvent prior to sonication prevents restacking by adsorbing to the graphene's surface. This produces a higher graphene concentration, but removing the surfactant requires chemical treatments.</p>
<h5 id="immiscible-liquids">Immiscible liquids</h5>

<p>Sonicating graphite at the interface of two immiscible liquids, most notably <a class="uri" href="heptane" title="wikilink">heptane</a> and water, producing macro-scale graphene films. The graphene sheets are adsorbed to the high energy interface between the heptane and the water, where they are kept from restacking. The graphene remains at the interface even when exposed to force in excess of 300,000 g. The solvents may then be evaporated. The sheets are up to ~95% transparent and conductive.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn242" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>Molten salts</strong></p>

<p>Graphite particles can be corroed in molten salts to form a variety of carbon nanostructures including graphene.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn243" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a> Moreover, high temperature diffusion of hydrogen into the interlayer space of graphite is a possible method for the rapid production of high-quality, inexpensive graphene in large quantities, which could lead to the widespread application of graphene. It was found that hydrogen cations, dissolved in molten LiCl, can be discharged on cathodically polarized graphite rods, which then intercalate into the graphite structure, leading to the peeling of graphite to produce graphene. The graphene nanosheets produced displayed a single-crystalline structure with a lateral size of several hundred nanometers and a high degree of crystallinity and thermal stability. The method introduced could be scaled up to produce industrial quantities of high-quality graphene.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn244" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="epitaxy">Epitaxy</h3>

<p><a class="uri" href="Epitaxy" title="wikilink">Epitaxy</a> refers to the deposition of a crystalline overlayer on a crystalline substrate, where there is registry between the two. In some cases epitaxial graphene layers are coupled to surfaces weakly enough (by <a href="Van_der_Waals_force" title="wikilink">Van der Waals forces</a>) to retain the two dimensional <a href="electronic_band_structure" title="wikilink">electronic band structure</a> of isolated graphene.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn245" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn246" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a> An example of weakly coupled epitaxial graphene is the one grown on SiC.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn247" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a></p>

<p>Graphene monolayers grown on silicon carbide and <a class="uri" href="iridium" title="wikilink">iridium</a> are weakly coupled to these substrates (how weakly remains debated) and the graphene–substrate interaction can be further passivated.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn248" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="silicon-carbide">Silicon carbide</h4>

<p>Heating <a href="silicon_carbide" title="wikilink">silicon carbide</a> (SiC) to high temperatures (&gt;) under low pressures (~10<sup>−6</sup> torr) reduces it to graphene.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn249" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a> This process produces epitaxial graphene with dimensions dependent upon the size of the wafer. The face of the SiC used for graphene formation, silicon- or carbon-terminated, highly influences the thickness, mobility and carrier density of the resulting graphene.</p>

<p>Graphene's electronic band-structure (so-called Dirac cone structure) was first visualized in this material.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn250" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn251" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn252" id="fnref252"><sup>252</sup></a> Weak anti-localization is observed in this material, but not in exfoliated graphene produced by the drawing method.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn253" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a> Large, temperature-independent mobilities approach those in exfoliated graphene placed on silicon oxide, but lower than mobilities in suspended graphene produced by the drawing method.

<p>The weak van der Waals force that provides the cohesion of multilayer graphene stacks does not always affect the electronic properties of the individual layers. That is, while the electronic properties of certain multilayered epitaxial graphenes are identical to that of a single layer,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn261" id="fnref261"><sup>261</sup></a> in other cases the properties are affected,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn262" id="fnref262"><sup>262</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn263" id="fnref263"><sup>263</sup></a> as they are in bulk graphite. This effect is well understood theoretically and is related to the symmetry of the interlayer interactions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn264" id="fnref264"><sup>264</sup></a></p>

<p>Epitaxial graphene on SiC can be patterned using standard microelectronics methods. A band gap can be created and tuned by laser irradiation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn265" id="fnref265"><sup>265</sup></a></p>

<h5 id="ruthenium">Ruthenium</h5>

<p>Graphene grown on <a class="uri" href="ruthenium" title="wikilink">ruthenium</a> does not typically produce uniform layer thickness. Bonding between the bottom graphene layer and the substrate may affect layer properties.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn266" id="fnref266"><sup>266</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="iridium">Iridium</h5>

<p>Graphene grown on <a class="uri" href="iridium" title="wikilink">iridium</a> is very weakly bonded, uniform in thickness and can be highly ordered. As on many other substrates, graphene on iridium is slightly rippled. Due to the long-range order of these ripples, minigaps in the electronic band-structure (Dirac cone) become visible.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn267" id="fnref267"><sup>267</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="nickel">Nickel</h5>

<p>High-quality sheets of few-layer graphene exceeding  in area have been synthesized via <a href="chemical_vapor_deposition" title="wikilink">chemical vapor deposition</a> on thin <a class="uri" href="nickel" title="wikilink">nickel</a> films using multiple techniques.</p>

<p>The growth of graphene on nickel films through <a href="chemical_vapor_deposition" title="wikilink">chemical vapor deposition</a> occurs in a few steps. First the thin nickel film is exposed to <a class="uri" href="Argon" title="wikilink">Argon</a> gas at 900–1000 degrees Celsius. <a class="uri" href="Methane" title="wikilink">Methane</a> is then mixed into the gas, and the carbon from the methane is absorbed into the nickel film. The nickel–carbon solution is then cooled down in argon gas. During the cooling process the carbon diffuses out of the nickel to form graphene films.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn268" id="fnref268"><sup>268</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn269" id="fnref269"><sup>269</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn270" id="fnref270"><sup>270</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn271" id="fnref271"><sup>271</sup></a></p>

<p>Another used temperatures compatible with conventional <a class="uri" href="CMOS" title="wikilink">CMOS</a> processing, using a nickel-based alloy with gold as catalyst.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn272" id="fnref272"><sup>272</sup></a> This process dissolves carbon atoms inside a <a href="transition_metal" title="wikilink">transition metal</a> melt at a certain temperature and then precipitates the dissolved carbon at lower temperatures as single layer graphene (SLG).</p>

<p>The metal is first melted in contact with a carbon source, possibly a graphite crucible inside which the melt is carried out or graphite powder/chunks that are placed in the melt. Keeping the melt in contact with the carbon at a specific temperature dissolves the carbon atoms, saturating the melt based on the metal–carbon <a href="binary_phase_diagram" title="wikilink">binary phase diagram</a>. Lowering the temperature decreases carbon's solubility and the excess carbon precipitates atop the melt. The floating layer can be either skimmed or frozen for later removal. Using different morphology, including thick graphite, few layer graphene (FLG) and SLG were observed on metal substrate. <a href="Raman_spectroscopy" title="wikilink">Raman spectroscopy</a> proved that SLG had grown on nickel substrate. The SLG Raman spectrum featured no D and D′ band, indicating its pristine nature. Since nickel is not Raman active, direct Raman spectroscopy of graphene layers on top of the nickel is achievable.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn273" id="fnref273"><sup>273</sup></a></p>

<p>Another approach covered a sheet of silicon dioxide glass (the substrate) on one side with a nickel film. Graphene deposited via chemical vapor deposition formed into layers on both sides of the film, one on the exposed top side, and one on the underside, sandwiched between nickel and glass. Peeling the nickel and the top layer of graphene left intervening layer of graphene behind on the glass. While the top graphene layer could be harvested from the foil as in earlier methods, the bottom layer was already in place on the glass. The quality and purity of the attached layer was not assessed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn274" id="fnref274"><sup>274</sup></a></p>

<p><a class="uri" href="Copper" title="wikilink">Copper</a> foil, at room temperature and very low pressure and in the presence of small amounts of <a class="uri" href="methane" title="wikilink">methane</a> produces high quality graphene.

These charged molecules scour the copper of surface imperfections, providing a pristine substrate.

<p>Supersonic acceleration of droplets through a <a href="Laval_nozzle" title="wikilink">Laval nozzle</a> was used to deposit small droplets of reduced graphene-oxide in suspension on a substrate.

<h3 id="intercalation">Intercalation</h3>

<p>Producing graphene via Intercalation splits graphite into single layer graphene by inserting guest molecules/ions between the graphene layers. Graphite was first intercaled in 1841 using a strong oxidizing or reducing agent that damaged the material's desirable properties.

<p>Research at Brown university found that 10 µm few-layered graphene flakes are able to pierce cell membranes in solution. They were observed to initially enter via sharp and jagged points, allowing graphene to be internalized in the cell. The physiological effects of this remain uncertain, and this remains a relatively unexplored field.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn309" id="fnref309"><sup>309</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn310" id="fnref310"><sup>310</sup></a></p>
