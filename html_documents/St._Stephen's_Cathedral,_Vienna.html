<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>By the middle of the 12th century, Vienna had become an important centre of German civilization in eastern Europe, and the four existing churches, including only one parish church, no longer met the town's religious needs. In 1137, <a href="Bishop_of_Passau" title="wikilink">Bishop of Passau</a> Reginmar and <a href="Leopold,_Duke_of_Bavaria" title="wikilink">Margrave Leopold IV</a> signed the Treaty of Mautern, which referred hito Vienna as a <em><a class="uri" href="civitas" title="wikilink">civitas</a></em> for the first time and transferred the <a href="St._Peter's_Church,_Vienna" title="wikilink">St. Peter's Church</a> to the <a href="Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Passau" title="wikilink">Diocese of Passau</a>. Under the treaty, <a href="Leopold_IV_of_Austria_(Babenberg)" title="wikilink">Margrave Leopold IV</a> also received from the bishop extended stretches of land beyond the city walls, with the notable exception of the territory allocated for the new parish church, which would eventually become St. Stephen's Cathedral. Although previously believed built in an open field outside the city walls, the new parish church was in actuality likely built on an ancient cemetery dating to <a href="Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ancient Roman</a> times; excavations for a heating system in 2000 revealed graves  below the surface, which were <a href="Radiocarbon_dating" title="wikilink">carbon-dated</a> to the 4th century. This discovery suggests that an even older religious building on this site predated the <a href="St._Rupert's_Church,_Vienna" title="wikilink">St. Rupert's Church</a>, which is considered the oldest church in Vienna</p>

<p> Founded in 1137 following the Treaty of Mautern, the partially constructed Romanesque church was solemnly dedicated in 1147 to <a href="Saint_Stephen" title="wikilink">Saint Stephen</a> in the presence of <a href="Conrad_III_of_Germany" title="wikilink">Conrad III of Germany</a>, <a href="Otto_of_Freising" title="wikilink">Bishop Otto of Freising</a>, and other German nobles who were about to embark on the <a href="Second_Crusade" title="wikilink">Second Crusade</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Although the first structure was completed in 1160,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> major reconstruction and expansion lasted until 1511, and repair and restoration projects continue to the present day. From 1230 to 1245, the initial Romanesque structure was extended westward; the present-day west wall and Romanesque towers date from this period. In 1258, however, a great fire destroyed much of the original building, and a larger replacement structure, also Romanesque in style and reusing the two towers, was constructed over the ruins of the old church and consecrated 23 April 1263. The anniversary of this second consecration is commemorated each year by a rare ringing of the <a class="uri" href="Pummerin" title="wikilink">Pummerin</a> bell for three minutes in the evening.</p>

<p>In 1304, <a href="Albert_I_of_Germany" title="wikilink">King Albert I</a> ordered a Gothic three-<a class="uri" href="nave" title="wikilink">nave</a> <a href="choir_(architecture)" title="wikilink">choir</a> to be constructed east of the church, wide enough to meet the tips of the old <a href="transept" title="wikilink">transepts</a>. Under his son <a href="Albert_II,_Duke_of_Austria" title="wikilink">Duke Albert II</a>, work continued on the Albertine choir, which was consecrated in 1340 on the 77th anniversary of the previous consecration. The middle nave is largely dedicated to St. Stephen and All <a class="uri" href="Saints" title="wikilink">Saints</a>, while the north and south nave, are dedicated to <a href="St._Mary" title="wikilink">St. Mary</a> and the <a href="Twelve_Apostles" title="wikilink">Apostles</a> respectively. <a href="Rudolf_IV,_Duke_of_Austria" title="wikilink">Duke Rudolf IV, <em>the Founder</em></a>, Albert II's son, expanded the choir again to increase the religious clout of Vienna. On 7 April 1359, Rudolf IV laid the cornerstone for a westward Gothic extension of the Albertine choir in the vicinity of the present south tower. This expansion would eventually encapsulate the entirety of the old church, and in 1430, the edifice of the old church was removed from within as work progressed on the new cathedral. The south tower was completed in 1433, and vaulting of the nave took place from 1446 to 1474. The foundation for a north tower was laid in 1450, and construction began under master <a href="Lorenz_Spenning" title="wikilink">Lorenz Spenning</a>, but its construction was abandoned when major work on the cathedral ceased in 1511.</p>

<p> In 1365, just six years after beginning the Gothic extension of the Albertine choir, Rudolf IV disregarded St. Stephen's status as a mere parish church and presumptuously established a <a href="Chapter_(religion)" title="wikilink">chapter</a> of <a href="Canon_(priest)" title="wikilink">canons</a> befitting a large cathedral. This move was only the first step in fulfilling Vienna's long-held desire to obtain its own <a class="uri" href="diocese" title="wikilink">diocese</a>; in 1469, <a href="Frederick_III,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Emperor Frederick III</a> prevailed upon <a href="Pope_Paul_II" title="wikilink">Pope Paul II</a> to grant Vienna its own bishop, to be appointed by the emperor. Despite long-standing resistance by the Bishops of Passau, who did not wish to lose control of the area, the Diocese of Vienna was canonically established 18 January 1469, with St. Stephen's Cathedral as its mother church. In 1722 during the reign of <a href="Karl_VI" title="wikilink">Karl VI</a>, <a href="Pope_Innocent_XIII" title="wikilink">Pope Innocent XIII</a> elevated the <a href="Episcopal_see" title="wikilink">see</a> to an archbishopric.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>During World War II, the cathedral was saved from intentional destruction at the hands of retreating <a href="Wehrmacht" title="wikilink">German forces</a> when Captain Gerhard Klinkicht disregarded orders from the city commandant, <a href="Josef_Dietrich" title="wikilink">Josef Dietrich</a>, to "fire a hundred shells and leave it in just debris and ashes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>" On 12 April 1945, civilian looters lit fires in nearby shops as <a href="Soviet_Army" title="wikilink">Soviet Army</a> troops entered the city. The winds carried the fire to the cathedral where it severely damaged the roof, causing it to collapse. Fortunately, protective brick shells built around the pulpit, Frederick III's tomb, and other treasures, minimized damage to the most valuable artworks. However, the Rollinger choir stalls, carved in 1487, could not be saved. Rebuilding began immediately, with a limited reopening 12 December 1948 and a full reopening 23 April 1952.</p>
<h2 id="exterior">Exterior</h2>

<p>The church was dedicated to St. Stephen, also the patron of the bishop's <a href="St._Stephen's_Cathedral,_Passau" title="wikilink">cathedral</a> in <a class="uri" href="Passau" title="wikilink">Passau</a>, and so was oriented toward the sunrise on his <a href="feast_day" title="wikilink">feast day</a> of 26 December, as the position stood in the year that construction began. Built of <a class="uri" href="limestone" title="wikilink">limestone</a>, the cathedral is  long,  wide, and  tall at its highest point. Over the centuries, soot and other forms of air pollution accumulating on the church have given it a black colour, but recent restoration projects have again returned some portions of the building to its original white.</p>
<h3 id="towers">Towers</h3>

<p> Standing at  tall and affectionately referred to by the city's inhabitants as "Steffl" (a <a href="diminutive#German" title="wikilink">diminutive</a> form of "Stephen"), St. Stephen's Cathedral's massive south tower is its highest point and a dominant feature of the Vienna skyline. Its construction lasted 65 years, from 1368 to 1433. During the <a href="Siege_of_Vienna" title="wikilink">Siege of Vienna</a> in 1529 and again during the <a href="Battle_of_Vienna" title="wikilink">Battle of Vienna</a> in 1683, it served as the main observation and command post for the defence of the walled city, and it even contains an apartment for the watchmen who, until 1955, manned the tower at night and rang the bells if a fire was spotted in the city. At the tip of the tower stands the double-eagle imperial emblem with the <a class="uri" href="Habsburg-Lorraine" title="wikilink">Habsburg-Lorraine</a> <a href="coat_of_arms" title="wikilink">coat of arms</a> on its chest, surmounted by a double-armed <a href="Patriarchal_cross" title="wikilink">apostolic cross</a>, which refers to <em>Apostolic Majesty</em>, the imperial <a href="style_(manner_of_address)" title="wikilink">style</a> of kings of <a class="uri" href="Hungary" title="wikilink">Hungary</a>.</p>

<p>The north tower was originally intended to mirror the south tower, but the design proved too ambitious, considering the era of Gothic cathedrals was nearing its end, and construction was halted in 1511. In 1578, the tower-stump was augmented with a <a href="Renaissance_architecture" title="wikilink">Renaissance</a> cap, nicknamed the "water tower top" by the Viennese. The tower now stands at  tall, roughly half the height of the south tower.</p>

<p>The main entrance to the church is named the Giant's Door, or <em>Riesentor</em>, referring to the <a href="femur" title="wikilink">thighbone</a> of a <a class="uri" href="mastodon" title="wikilink">mastodon</a> that hung over it for decades after being unearthed in 1443 while digging the foundations for the north tower. The <a href="tympanum_(architecture)" title="wikilink">tympanum</a> above the Giant's Door depicts <a href="Christ_Pantocrator" title="wikilink">Christ Pantocrator</a> flanked by two winged <a href="angel" title="wikilink">angels</a>, while on the left and right are the two Roman Towers, or <em>Heidentürme</em>, that each stand at approximately  tall. The name for the towers derives from the fact that they were constructed from the rubble of old structures built by the Romans (German <em>Heiden</em> meaning heathens or <a href="pagan" title="wikilink">pagans</a>) during their occupation of the area. Square at the base and octagonal above the roofline, the <em>Heidentürme</em> originally housed bells; those in the south tower were lost during World War II, but the north tower remains an operational bell tower. The Roman Towers, together with the Giant's Door, are the oldest parts of the church.</p>
<h3 id="roof">Roof</h3>

<p> The glory of St. Stephen's Cathedral is its ornately patterned, richly coloured roof,  long, and covered by 230,000 glazed <a href="tile" title="wikilink">tiles</a>. Above the <a class="uri" href="choir" title="wikilink">choir</a> on the south side of the building the tiles form a <a class="uri" href="mosaic" title="wikilink">mosaic</a> of the double-headed eagle that is symbolic of the empire ruled from Vienna by the <a class="uri" href="Habsburg" title="wikilink">Habsburg</a> dynasty. On the north side the <a href="coats_of_arms" title="wikilink">coats of arms</a> of the <a href="http://www.wien.gv.at/english/">City of Vienna</a> and of the <a href="http://www.austria.gv.at/site/3327/Default.aspx">Republic of Austria</a> are depicted. In 1945, fire caused by World War II damage to nearby buildings leapt to the north tower of the cathedral and destroyed the wooden framework of the roof. Replicating the original bracing for so large a roof (it rises 38 metres above the floor) would have been cost prohibitive, so over 600 <a href="metric_ton" title="wikilink">metric tons</a> of steel bracing were used instead. The roof is so steep that it is sufficiently cleaned by the rain alone and is seldom covered by snow.</p>
<h3 id="bells">Bells</h3>

<p>Composer <a href="Ludwig_van_Beethoven" title="wikilink">Ludwig van Beethoven</a> discovered the totality of his deafness when he saw birds flying out of the bell tower as a result of the bells' tolling but could not hear the bells. St. Stephen's Cathedral has 23 <a href="bell_(instrument)" title="wikilink">bells</a> in total. The largest is officially named for <a href="St._Mary" title="wikilink">St. Mary</a>, but usually called <em><a class="uri" href="Pummerin" title="wikilink">Pummerin</a></em> ("Boomer") and hangs in the north tower. At , it is the largest in Austria and the second largest swinging bell in Europe after the  <em>Peter</em> in <a href="Cologne_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Cologne Cathedral</a>). Originally cast in 1711 from cannons captured from the Muslim invaders, it was recast (partly from its original metal) in 1951 after crashing onto the floor when its wooden cradle burned during the 1945 fire. The new bell has a diameter of  and was a gift from the province of <a href="Upper_Austria" title="wikilink">Upper Austria</a>. It sounds on only a few special occasions each year, including the arrival of the new year. Also in this tower are three older bells that are no longer used: <em>Kleine Glocke</em> ("small bell") () cast around 1280; <em>Speisglocke</em> ("dinner bell") () cast in 1746; and <em>Zügenglocke</em> ("processions bell") () cast in 1830.</p>

<p> A peal of eleven electrically operated bells, cast in 1960, hangs in the soaring south tower. Replacements for other ancient bells also lost in the 1945 fire, they are used during Masses at the cathedral: four are used for an ordinary Mass; the quantity increases to as many as ten for a major holiday Mass; and the eleventh and largest is added when the <a href="Cardinal_(Catholicism)" title="wikilink">Cardinal</a> <a href="Archbishop_of_Vienna" title="wikilink">Archbishop of Vienna</a> himself is present. From the largest to the smallest, they are named the <em><a href="Saint_Stephen" title="wikilink">St. Stephen</a></em> (); <em><a href="Leopold_III_of_Austria_(Babenberg)" title="wikilink">St. Leopold</a></em> (); <em><a href="Saint_Christopher" title="wikilink">St. Christopher</a></em> (); <em><a href="Saint_Leonhard" title="wikilink">St. Leonhard</a></em> (); <em><a href="Saint_Joseph" title="wikilink">St. Josef</a></em> (); <em><a href="Petrus_Canisius" title="wikilink">St. Peter Canisius</a></em> (); <em><a href="Pope_Pius_X" title="wikilink">St. Pius X</a></em> (280 kg); <em><a href="Saint" title="wikilink">All Saints</a></em> (); <em><a href="Clemens_Maria_Hofbauer" title="wikilink">St. Clement Maria Hofbauer</a></em> (); <em><a href="Michael_(archangel)" title="wikilink">St. Michael</a></em> (); and <em><a href="Saint_Tarsicius" title="wikilink">St. Tarsicius</a></em> (). Also in this tallest tower are the <em>Primglocke</em> (recast in 1772) and the <em>Uhrschälle</em> (cast in 1449), which mark the passing of the hours.</p>

<p>The north Roman Tower contains six bells, five of which were cast in 1772, that ring for evening prayers and toll for funerals. They are working bells of the cathedral and their names usually recall their original uses: <em>Feuerin</em> ("fire alarm" but now used as a call to evening prayers) cast in 1859; <em>Kantnerin</em> (calling the cantors (musicians) to Mass); <em>Feringerin</em> (used for High Mass on Sundays); <em>Bieringerin</em> ("beer ringer" for last call at taverns); <em>Poor Souls</em> (the funeral bell); and <em>Churpötsch</em> (donated by the local <a class="uri" href="curia" title="wikilink">curia</a> in honor of the Maria Pötsch icon in the cathedral).</p>

<p>The 1945 fire destroyed the bells that hung in the south Roman Tower.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p> During the Middle Ages, major cities had their own set of measures and the public availability of these standards allowed visiting merchants to comply with local regulations. The official Viennese <a class="uri" href="ell" title="wikilink">ell</a> length standards for verifying the measure of different types of cloth sold are embedded in the cathedral wall, to the left of the main entrance. The linen <a href="w:Ell" title="wikilink">ell</a>, also called <a href="Viennese_yard" title="wikilink">Viennese yard</a>, () and the drapery <a href="w:Ell" title="wikilink">ell</a> () length standards consist of two iron bars. According to Franz Twaroch, the ratio between the linen ell and the drapery ell is exactly

<h3 id="altars">Altars</h3>

<p>The main part of the church contains 18 <a href="altar" title="wikilink">altars</a>, with more in the various chapels. The High Altar (<strong>HA</strong>) and the Wiener Neustadt Altar () (<strong>WNA</strong>) are the most famous.</p>

<p>The first focal point of any visitor is the distant High Altar, built over seven years from 1641 to 1647 as part of the first refurbishment of the cathedral in the <a class="uri" href="baroque" title="wikilink">baroque</a> style. The altar was built by <a href="Tobias_Pock" title="wikilink">Tobias Pock</a> at the direction of Vienna's Bishop <a href="Philipp_Friedrich_Graf_Breuner" title="wikilink">Philipp Friedrich Graf Breuner</a> with marble from <a class="uri" href="Poland" title="wikilink">Poland</a>, <a class="uri" href="Styria" title="wikilink">Styria</a> and <a href="Tyrol_(state)" title="wikilink">Tyrol</a>. The High Altar represents the stoning of the church's patron <a href="St._Stephen" title="wikilink">St. Stephen</a>. It is framed by figures of patron saints from the surrounding areas – Saints <a href="Leopold_III,_Margrave_of_Austria" title="wikilink">Leopold</a>, <a href="Saint_Florian" title="wikilink">Florian</a>, <a href="Saint_Sebastian" title="wikilink">Sebastian</a> and <a href="Saint_Roch" title="wikilink">Rochus</a> – and surmounted with a statue of <a href="St._Mary" title="wikilink">St. Mary</a> which draws the beholder's eye to a glimpse of heaven where Christ waits for Stephen (the first <a class="uri" href="martyr" title="wikilink">martyr</a>) to ascend from below.</p>

<p> The Wiener Neustädter Altar at the head of the north nave was ordered in 1447 by Emperor <a href="Frederick_III,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Frederick III</a>, whose tomb is located in the opposite direction. On the <a class="uri" href="predella" title="wikilink">predella</a> is his famous <a class="uri" href="A.E.I.O.U." title="wikilink">A.E.I.O.U.</a> device. Frederick ordered it for the <a class="uri" href="Cistercian" title="wikilink">Cistercian</a> <a href="Viktring_Abbey" title="wikilink">Viktring Abbey</a> (near <a class="uri" href="Klagenfurt" title="wikilink">Klagenfurt</a>) where it remained until the abbey was closed in 1786 as part of Emperor <a href="Joseph_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Joseph II's</a> <a class="uri" href="anti-clerical" title="wikilink">anti-clerical</a> reforms. It was then sent to the Cistercian monastery of <a href="Bernard_of_Clairvaux" title="wikilink">St. Bernard of Clairvaux</a> (founded by Emperor Frederick III) in the city of <a href="Wiener_Neustadt" title="wikilink">Wiener Neustadt</a>, and finally sold in 1885 to St. Stephen's Cathedral when the Wiener Neustadt monastery was closed after merging with <a href="Heiligenkreuz_Abbey" title="wikilink">Heiligenkreuz Abbey</a>.</p>

<p>The Wiener Neustädter Altar is composed of two <a href="triptych" title="wikilink">triptychs</a>, the upper being four times taller than the lower one. When the lower panels are opened, the Gothic grate of the former <a class="uri" href="reliquary" title="wikilink">reliquary</a> depot above the altar is revealed. On weekdays, the four panels are closed and display a drab painted scene involving 72 saints. On Sundays, the panels are opened showing <a class="uri" href="gilded" title="wikilink">gilded</a> wooden figures depicting events in the life of the <a href="Virgin_Mary" title="wikilink">Virgin Mary</a>.

The 50 x 70 cm icon was commissioned in 1676 from painter <a href="István_Papp" title="wikilink">István Papp</a> by <a href="László_Csigri" title="wikilink">László Csigri</a> upon his release as a <a href="prisoner_of_war" title="wikilink">prisoner of war</a> from the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Turks</a> who were invading <a class="uri" href="Hungary" title="wikilink">Hungary</a> at the time. As Csigri was unable to pay the 6-<a class="uri" href="forint" title="wikilink">forint</a> fee the icon was bought by <a href="Lőrinc_Hurta" title="wikilink">Lőrinc Hurta</a> who donated it to the church of Pócs.</p>

<p>After two <a href="miracle" title="wikilink">miraculous</a> incidents in 1696 with the mother in the picture shedding real tears, Emperor <a href="Leopold_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Leopold I</a> ordered it brought to St. Stephen's Cathedral, where it would be safe from the Muslim armies that still controlled much of Hungary. Upon its arrival after a triumphal five-month journey in 1697, Empress <a href="Eleonora_Magdalena_of_Pfalz-Neuburg" title="wikilink">Eleonora Magdalena</a> commissioned the splendid <em>Rosa Mystica</em> <a class="uri" href="oklad" title="wikilink">oklad</a> and framework (now one of several) for it, and the Emperor personally ordered the icon placed near the High Altar in the front of the church, where it stood prominently from 1697 until 1945. Since then, it has been in a different framework, above an altar under a medieval stone <a class="uri" href="baldachin" title="wikilink">baldachin</a> near the southwest corner of the <a class="uri" href="nave" title="wikilink">nave</a> – where the many burning candles indicate the extent of its <a class="uri" href="veneration" title="wikilink">veneration</a>, especially by Hungarians. Since its arrival the picture has not been seen weeping again but other miracles and answered prayers have been attributed to it, including <a href="Prince_Eugene_of_Savoy" title="wikilink">Prince Eugene of Savoy</a>'s victory over the Turks at <a href="Senta" title="wikilink">Zenta</a> few weeks after the icon's installation in the Stephansdom.</p>

<p>The residents of Pócs wanted their holy miracle-working painting returned, but the emperor sent them a copy instead. Since then, the copy has been reported to weep real tears and work miracles, so the village changed its name from merely <em>Pócs</em> to <em><a class="uri" href="Máriapócs" title="wikilink">Máriapócs</a></em> and has become an important pilgrimage site.</p>
<h3 id="pulpit">Pulpit</h3>

<p> The stone <a class="uri" href="pulpit" title="wikilink">pulpit</a> is a masterwork of late <a href="Gothic_art" title="wikilink">Gothic</a> sculpture. Long attributed to <a href="Anton_Pilgram" title="wikilink">Anton Pilgram</a>, today <a href="Nikolaus_Gerhaert" title="wikilink">Niclaes Gerhaert van Leyden</a> is thought more likely to be the carver. So that the local language <a class="uri" href="sermon" title="wikilink">sermon</a> could be better heard by the worshipers in the days before microphones and loud speakers, the pulpit stands against a <a href="column" title="wikilink">pillar</a> out in the <a class="uri" href="nave" title="wikilink">nave</a>, instead of in the <a class="uri" href="chancel" title="wikilink">chancel</a> at the front of the church.</p>

<p>The sides of the pulpit erupt like stylized petals from the stem supporting it. On those Gothic petals are <a class="uri" href="relief" title="wikilink">relief</a> portraits of the four original <a href="Doctors_of_the_Church" title="wikilink">Doctors of the Church</a> (St. <a href="Augustine_of_Hippo" title="wikilink">Augustine of Hippo</a>, St. <a class="uri" href="Ambrose" title="wikilink">Ambrose</a>, St. <a href="Pope_Gregory_I" title="wikilink">Gregory the Great</a> and St. <a class="uri" href="Jerome" title="wikilink">Jerome</a>), each of them in one of four different temperaments and in one of four different stages of life. The handrail of the stairway curving its way around the pillar from ground level to the pulpit has fantastic decorations of <a href="toad" title="wikilink">toads</a> and <a href="lizard" title="wikilink">lizards</a> biting each other, symbolizing the fight of good against evil. At the top of the stairs, a stone <a href="dog" title="wikilink">puppy</a> protects the preacher from intruders.</p>

<p>Beneath the stairs is one of the most beloved symbols of the cathedral: a stone self-portrait of the unknown sculptor gawking (German: <em>gucken</em>) out of a window (German: <em>fenster</em>) and thus famously known as the <em>Fenstergucker</em>. The <a class="uri" href="chisel" title="wikilink">chisel</a> in the subject's hand, and the <a class="uri" href="stonemason" title="wikilink">stonemason</a>'s signature <a href="Mason's_mark" title="wikilink">mark</a> on the shield above the window led to the speculation that it could be a self-portrait of the sculptor.</p>
<h3 id="chapels">Chapels</h3>

<p> There are several formal chapels in St. Stephen's Cathedral:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Catherine_of_Alexandria" title="wikilink">St. Katherine's</a> Chapel, in the base of the south tower, is the baptismal chapel. The 14-sided baptismal font was completed in 1481, and its cover was formerly the sound board above the famed pulpit in the main church. Its marble base shows the four Evangelists, while the niches of the basin feature the twelve apostles, Christ and St. Stephan.</li>
<li><a href="Saint_Barbara" title="wikilink">St. Barbara's</a> Chapel, in the base of the north tower, is used for meditation and prayer.</li>
<li><a href="Saint_Eligius" title="wikilink">St. Eligius's</a> Chapel, in the southeast corner, is open for prayer. The altar is dedicated to <a href="St._Valentine" title="wikilink">St. Valentine</a> whose body (one of three, held by various churches) is in another chapel, upstairs.</li>
<li><a href="Bartholomew" title="wikilink">St. Bartholomew's</a> Chapel, above St. Eligius' Chapel, has recently been restored.</li>
<li>The Chapel of the Cross (<strong>PES</strong>), in the northeast corner, holds the burial place of <a href="Prince_Eugene_of_Savoy" title="wikilink">Prince Eugene of Savoy</a> in the vault containing 3 coffins and a heart urn, under a massive stone slab with iron rings. The funeral of <a class="uri" href="Mozart" title="wikilink">Mozart</a> occurred here 6 December 1791. The beard on the crucified Christ above the altar is of real hair. The chapel is not open to the public.</li>
<li><a href="Saint_Valentine" title="wikilink">St. Valentine's</a> Chapel, above the Chapel of the Cross, is the current depository of the hundreds of <a href="relic" title="wikilink">relics</a> belonging to the <em>Stephansdom</em>, including a piece of the tablecloth from the <a href="The_Last_Supper" title="wikilink">Last Supper</a>. A large chest holds the bones of St. Valentine that were moved here about a century ago, from what is now the Chapter House to the south of the High Altar.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tombs-catacombs-and-crypts">Tombs, catacombs, and crypts</h3>

<p> Since its earliest days, the cathedral has been surrounded by <a href="cemetery" title="wikilink">cemeteries</a> dating back to Roman times, and has sheltered the bodies of notables and commoners. It has always been an honour to be buried inside a church, close to the physical presence of the <a href="saint" title="wikilink">saints</a> whose <a href="relic" title="wikilink">relics</a> are preserved there. Those less honoured were buried near, but outside, the church.</p>

<p>Inside the cathedral are the tombs of <a href="Prince_Eugene_of_Savoy" title="wikilink">Prince Eugene of Savoy</a> (<strong>PES</strong>), commander of the Imperial forces during the <a href="War_of_the_Spanish_Succession" title="wikilink">War of the Spanish Succession</a> in the <em>Chapel of The Cross</em> (northwest corner of the cathedral) and of <a href="Frederick_III,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor</a> (<strong>Fr3</strong>), under whose reign the Diocese of Vienna was canonically erected on 18 January 1469, in the Apostles' Choir (southeast corner of the cathedral).</p>

<p> The construction of Emperor Frederick's tomb spanned over 45 years, starting 25 years before his death. The impressive <a class="uri" href="sarcophagus" title="wikilink">sarcophagus</a> is made of the unusually dense red <a class="uri" href="marble" title="wikilink">marble</a>-like stone found at the <a class="uri" href="Adnet" title="wikilink">Adnet</a> quarry. Carved by <a href="Nikolaus_Gerhaert" title="wikilink">Niclaes Gerhaert van Leyden</a>, the tomb lid shows Emperor Frederick in his <a class="uri" href="coronation" title="wikilink">coronation</a> <a class="uri" href="regalia" title="wikilink">regalia</a> surrounded by the <a href="coats_of_arms" title="wikilink">coats of arms</a> of all of his dominions. The body of the tomb has 240 statues and is a glory of medieval sculptural art.</p>

<p>When the <a href="charnel_house" title="wikilink">charnel house</a> and eight cemeteries abutting the cathedral's side and back walls closed due to an outbreak of <a href="bubonic_plague" title="wikilink">bubonic plague</a> in 1735, the bones within them were moved to the <a href="catacomb" title="wikilink">catacombs</a> below the church. Burials directly in the catacombs occurred until 1783, when a new law forbade most burials within the city. The remains of over 11,000 persons are in the catacombs (which may be toured).</p>

<p>The basement of the cathedral also hosts the Bishops, Provosts and Ducal crypts. The most recent interment in the Bishop's crypt completed in 1952 under the south <a href="Choir_(architecture)" title="wikilink">choir</a> was that of 98-year-old Cardinal <a href="Franz_König" title="wikilink">Franz König</a> in 2004. <a href="Provost_(religion)" title="wikilink">Provosts</a> of the cathedral are buried in another chamber. Other members of the cathedral chapter are now buried in a special section at the <a class="uri" href="Zentralfriedhof" title="wikilink">Zentralfriedhof</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="Ducal_Crypt_(Vienna)" title="wikilink">Ducal Crypt</a> located under the <a class="uri" href="chancel" title="wikilink">chancel</a> holds 78 bronze containers with the bodies, hearts, or <a class="uri" href="viscera" title="wikilink">viscera</a> of 72 members of the <a class="uri" href="Habsburg" title="wikilink">Habsburg</a> dynasty. Before his death in 1365, Duke <a href="Rudolf_IV_of_Austria" title="wikilink">Rudolf IV</a> ordered the crypt built for his remains in the new cathedral he commissioned. By 1754, the small rectangular chamber was overcrowded with 12 sarcophagi and 39 urns, so the area was expanded with an oval chamber added to the east end of the rectangular one. In 1956, the two chambers were renovated and their contents rearranged. The <a class="uri" href="sarcophagi" title="wikilink">sarcophagi</a> of Duke Rudolf IV and his wife were placed upon a pedestal and the 62 urns containing organs were moved from the two rows of shelves around the new chamber to cabinets in the original one. </p>
<h3 id="organs">Organs</h3>

<p>St Stephen's Cathedral has an old <a href="pipe_organ" title="wikilink">organ</a> tradition. The first <a href="pipe_organ" title="wikilink">organ</a> is mentioned in 1334.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> After the 1945 fire, Michael Kauffmann finished a large electric organ in 1960 with 125 voices and 4 manuals, financed with public donations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In 1991, the <a href="Austria" title="wikilink">Austrian</a> firm of <a href="Rieger_Orgelbau" title="wikilink">Rieger</a> rebuilt the choir organ. It is a mechanical organ, with 56 voices and 4 manuals.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="conservation-and-restoration">Conservation and restoration</h2>

<p>  Preservation and repair of the fabric of the medieval cathedral has been a continuous process at St. Stephen's Cathedral since its original construction in 1147.</p>

<p>The porous <a class="uri" href="limestone" title="wikilink">limestone</a> is subject to weathering, but coating it with a sealer like silicone would simply trap moisture inside the stone and cause it to crack faster when the water freezes. The permanent <em>Dombauhütte</em> (Construction Department) uses the latest scientific techniques (including <a class="uri" href="laser" title="wikilink">laser</a> cleaning of delicate features on stonework), and is investigating a process that would impregnate the cavities within the stone with something that would keep water from having a place to infiltrate.</p>

<p>The most visible current repair project is a multi-year renovation of the tall south tower, for which scaffolding has been installed. Fees from advertising on the netting around the scaffolding were defraying some of the costs of the work, but the concept of such advertising was controversial and has been discontinued. As of December 2008, the majority of the restoration on the south tower has been finished, and most scaffolding removed.</p>

<p> Systematic cleaning of the interior is gradually proceeding around the walls, and an outdoor <a class="uri" href="relief" title="wikilink">relief</a> of Christ in <a class="uri" href="Gethsemane" title="wikilink">Gethsemane</a> is being restored.</p>

<p>A major project has been recently completed for which visitors and worshippers in St. Stephen's Cathedral had been waiting since 1147: better heating of the church during the winter. Previous systems, including fireplaces, just deposited soot and grease on the artwork, but the new system uses apparatus in many different locations so that there is little moving airflow to carry damaging particles. The church is now heated to around .</p>

<p>Some of the architectural drawings date from the Middle Ages and are on paper 15 ft long and too fragile to handle. Laser measurements of the ancient cathedral have now been made so that a digital 3-dimensional virtual model of the cathedral now exists in its computers, and detailed modern plans can be output at will. When weathered stonework needs to be repaired or replaced, the computerized system can create life-sized models to guide the nine full-time stonemasons on staff in the on-site workshops against the north wall of the cathedral.</p>

<p>On 29 March 2014, a 37-year-old <a href="Ghana" title="wikilink">Ghanaian</a> asylum seeker <a href="Vandalism" title="wikilink">vandalized</a> the interior of the cathedral by pushing the statue of <a href="Jude_the_Apostle" title="wikilink">St. Jude Thaddeus</a> from its marble base.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="stephansdom-in-popular-culture">Stephansdom in popular culture</h2>

<p>As Vienna's landmark, the St. Stephen's Cathedral is featured in media including films, video games, and television shows. These include <a href="The_Third_Man" title="wikilink">The Third Man</a> and <a href="Burnout_3" title="wikilink">Burnout 3</a>. The cathedral is also depicted on the Austrian <a href="10_cent_euro_coins" title="wikilink">10 cent euro coins</a> and on the packaging of the <a class="uri" href="Manner" title="wikilink">Manner</a>-Schnitten wafer treat. The Archdiocese of Vienna allowed the Manner company to use the Cathedral as its logo in return for funding the wages of one stonemason doing repair work on the Cathedral.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In 2008, <a href="Sarah_Brightman" title="wikilink">Sarah Brightman</a> performed a concert promoting her latest album, <em><a href="Symphony_(album)" title="wikilink">Symphony</a></em>, which was recorded for a TV broadcast and a further DVD release in late September.</p>
<h2 id="balassi-mass">Balassi Mass</h2>

<p>Since 2008, the two sabres of the <a href="Balint_Balassi_Memorial_Sword_Award" title="wikilink">Balint Balassi Memorial Sword Award</a>, founded by <a href="Pal_Molnar" title="wikilink">Pal Molnar</a>, have been blessed during a Balassi Mass held a few days before the award ceremony. On 25 January 2013, in the presence of some three hundred Hungarians, Bishop Laszlo Kiss-Rigo blessed the two swords during a Mass celebrated in the cathedral.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
