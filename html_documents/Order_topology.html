<h1>Order topology</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, an <strong>order topology</strong> is a certain <a class="uri" href="topology" title="wikilink">topology</a> that can be defined on any <a href="totally_ordered_set" title="wikilink">totally ordered set</a>. It is a natural generalization of the topology of the <a href="real_numbers" title="wikilink">real numbers</a> to arbitrary totally ordered sets.</p>
<p>If <em>X</em> is a totally ordered set, the <strong>order topology</strong> on <em>X</em> is generated by the <a class="uri" href="subbase" title="wikilink">subbase</a> of "open rays"</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$(a, \infty) = \{ x \mid a < x\}$$</span></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$(-\infty, b) = \{x \mid x < b\}$$</span> for all <em>a,b</em> in <em>X</em>. This is equivalent to saying that the open <a href="interval_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">intervals</a></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$(a,b) = \{x \mid a < x < b\}$$</span> together with the above rays form a <a href="base_(topology)" title="wikilink">base</a> for the order topology. The open sets in <em>X</em> are the sets that are a <a href="union_(set_theory)" title="wikilink">union</a> of (possibly infinitely many) such open intervals and rays.</p>
<p>The order topology makes <em>X</em> into a <a href="completely_normal_space" title="wikilink">completely normal</a> <a href="Hausdorff_space" title="wikilink">Hausdorff space</a>.</p>
<p>The standard topologies on <strong>R</strong>, <strong>Q</strong>, and <strong>N</strong> are the order topologies.</p>
<h2 id="induced-order-topology">Induced order topology</h2>
<p>If <em>Y</em> is a subset of <em>X</em>, then <em>Y</em> inherits a total order from <em>X</em>. The set <em>Y</em> therefore has an order topology, the <strong>induced order topology</strong>. As a subset of <em>X</em>, <em>Y</em> also has a <a href="subspace_topology" title="wikilink">subspace topology</a>. The subspace topology is always at least as <a href="finer_topology" title="wikilink">fine</a> as the induced order topology, but they are not in general the same.</p>
<p>For example, consider the subset <em>Y</em> = {–1} ∪ {1/<em>n</em>}<sub><em>n</em>∈<strong>N</strong></sub> in the <a href="rational_numbers" title="wikilink">rationals</a>. Under the subspace topology, the singleton set {–1} is open in <em>Y</em>, but under the induced order topology, any open set containing –1 must contain all but finitely many members of the space.</p>
<h2 id="an-example-of-a-subspace-of-a-linearly-ordered-space-whose-topology-is-not-an-order-topology">An example of a subspace of a linearly ordered space whose topology is not an order topology</h2>
<p>Though the subspace topology of <em>Y</em> = {–1} ∪ {1/<em>n</em>}<sub><em>n</em>∈<strong>N</strong></sub> in the section above is shown to be not generated by the induced order on <em>Y</em>, it is nonetheless an order topology on <em>Y</em>; indeed, in the subspace topology every point is isolated (i.e., singleton {y} is open in <em>Y</em> for every y in <em>Y</em>), so the subspace topology is the discrete topology on <em>Y</em> (the topology in which every subset of <em>Y</em> is an open set), and the discrete topology on any set is an order topology. To define a total order on <em>Y</em> that generates the discrete topology on <em>Y</em>, simply modify the induced order on <em>Y</em> by defining -1 to be the greatest element of <em>Y</em> and otherwise keeping the same order for the other points, so that in this new order (call it say <em></em>1<em>) we have 1/</em>n'' <em></em>1'' –1 for all <em>n</em>∈<strong>N</strong>. Then, in the order topology on <em>Y</em> generated by <em></em>1'', every point of <em>Y</em> is isolated in <em>Y</em>.</p>
<p>We wish to define here a subset <em>Z</em> of a linearly ordered topological space <em>X</em> such that no total order on <em>Z</em> generates the subspace topology on <em>Z</em>, so that the subspace topology will not be an order topology even though it is the subspace topology of a space whose topology is an order topology.</p>
<p>Let <span class="LaTeX">$Z = \{-1\}\cup (0,1)$</span> in the real line. The same argument as before shows that the subspace topology on Z is not equal to the induced order topology on Z, but one can show that the subspace topology on Z cannot be equal to any order topology on Z.</p>
<p>An argument follows. Suppose by way of contradiction that there is some <a href="Totally_ordered_set#Strict_total_order" title="wikilink">strict total order</a> (-\infty, -1)</p>
<p>and <span class="LaTeX">$(-1, \infty)$</span> separate M, a contradiction. Thus, M\subseteq A. Then (-1,a)=[p,a), so [p,a) is open. {p}∪A=[p,a)∪A, so {p}∪A is an open subset of M and hence M = ({p}∪A) ∪ B is the union of two disjoint open subsets of M so M is not connected, a contradiction.</p>
<p>A space whose topology is an order topology is called a Linearly Ordered Topological Space (LOTS), and a subspace of a linearly ordered topological space is called a Generalized Ordered Space (GO-space). Thus the example Z above is an example of a GO-space that is not a linearly ordered topological space.</p>
<h2 id="left-and-right-order-topologies">Left and right order topologies</h2>
<p>Several variants of the order topology can be given:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>right order topology</strong> on <em>X</em> is the topology whose open sets consist of intervals of the form (<em>a</em>, ∞) (including (-∞, ∞)).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li>The <strong>left order topology</strong> on <em>X</em> is the topology whose open sets consist of intervals of the form (−∞, <em>b</em>) (including (-∞, ∞)).</li>
</ul>
<p>The left and right order topologies can be used to give counterexamples in general topology. For example, the left or right order topology on a bounded set provides an example of a <a href="compact_space" title="wikilink">compact space</a> that is not Hausdorff.</p>
<p>The left order topology is the standard topology used for many set-theoretic purposes on a <a href="Boolean_algebra_(structure)" title="wikilink">Boolean algebra</a>.</p>
<h2 id="ordinal-space">Ordinal space</h2>
<p>For any <a href="ordinal_number" title="wikilink">ordinal number</a> λ one can consider the spaces of ordinal numbers</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$[0,\lambda) = \{\alpha \mid \alpha < \lambda\}\,$$</span></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$[0,\lambda] = \{\alpha \mid \alpha \le \lambda\}\,$$</span> together with the natural order topology. These spaces are called <strong>ordinal spaces</strong>. (Note that in the usual set-theoretic construction of ordinal numbers we have λ = [0,λ) and λ + 1 = [0,λ]). Obviously, these spaces are mostly of interest when λ is an infinite ordinal; otherwise (for finite ordinals), the order topology is simply the <a href="discrete_topology" title="wikilink">discrete topology</a>.</p>
<p>When λ = ω (the first infinite ordinal), the space [0,ω) is just <strong>N</strong> with the usual (still discrete) topology, while [0,ω] is the <a href="one-point_compactification" title="wikilink">one-point compactification</a> of <strong>N</strong>.</p>
<p>Of particular interest is the case when λ = ω<sub>1</sub>, the set of all countable ordinals, and the <a href="first_uncountable_ordinal" title="wikilink">first uncountable ordinal</a>. The element ω<sub>1</sub> is a <a href="limit_point" title="wikilink">limit point</a> of the subset [0,ω<sub>1</sub>) even though no sequence of elements in [0,ω<sub>1</sub>) has the element ω<sub>1</sub> as its limit. In particular, [0,ω<sub>1</sub>] is not <a href="First-countable_space" title="wikilink">first-countable</a>. The subspace [0,ω<sub>1</sub>) is first-countable however, since the only point without a countable <a href="local_base" title="wikilink">local base</a> is ω<sub>1</sub>. Some further properties include</p>
<ul>
<li>neither [0,ω<sub>1</sub>) or [0,ω<sub>1</sub>] is <a href="separable_space" title="wikilink">separable</a> or <a class="uri" href="second-countable" title="wikilink">second-countable</a></li>
<li>[0,ω<sub>1</sub>] is <a href="compact_space" title="wikilink">compact</a> while [0,ω<sub>1</sub>) is <a href="Sequentially_compact_space" title="wikilink">sequentially compact</a> and <a href="Countably_compact_space" title="wikilink">countably compact</a>, but not compact or <a class="uri" href="paracompact" title="wikilink">paracompact</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="topology-and-ordinals">Topology and ordinals</h2>
<h3 id="ordinals-as-topological-spaces">Ordinals as topological spaces</h3>
<p>Any <a href="ordinal_number" title="wikilink">ordinal number</a> can be made into a <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topological space</a> by endowing it with the order topology (since, being well-ordered, an ordinal is in particular <a href="total_order" title="wikilink">totally ordered</a>): in the absence of indication to the contrary, it is always that order topology that is meant when an ordinal is thought of as a topological space. (Note that if we are willing to accept a proper class as a topological space, then the class of all ordinals is also a topological space for the order topology.)</p>
<p>The set of <a href="limit_point" title="wikilink">limit points</a> of an ordinal α is precisely the set of <a href="limit_ordinal" title="wikilink">limit ordinals</a> less than α. Successor ordinals (and zero) less than α are <a href="isolated_point" title="wikilink">isolated points</a> in α. In particular, the finite ordinals and ω are <a href="discrete_space" title="wikilink">discrete</a> topological spaces, and no ordinal beyond that is discrete. The ordinal α is <a href="compact_space" title="wikilink">compact</a> as a topological space if and only if α is a <a href="successor_ordinal" title="wikilink">successor ordinal</a>.</p>
<p>The closed sets of a limit ordinal α are just the closed sets in the sense that we have <a href="#Closed_unbounded_sets_and_classes" title="wikilink">already defined</a>, namely, those that contain a limit ordinal whenever they contain all sufficiently large ordinals below it.</p>
<p>Any ordinal is, of course, an open subset of any further ordinal. We can also define the topology on the ordinals in the following inductive way: 0 is the empty topological space, α+1 is obtained by taking the <a href="Compactification_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">one-point compactification</a> of α (if α is a limit ordinal; if it is not, α+1 is merely the disjoint union of α and a point), and for δ a limit ordinal, δ is equipped with the <a href="direct_limit" title="wikilink">inductive limit</a> topology.</p>
<p>As topological spaces, all the ordinals are <a href="Hausdorff_space" title="wikilink">Hausdorff</a> and even <a href="normal_space" title="wikilink">normal</a>. They are also <a href="totally_disconnected_space" title="wikilink">totally disconnected</a> (connected components are points), <a href="scattered_space" title="wikilink">scattered</a> (every non-empty set has an isolated point; in this case, just take the smallest element), <a href="zero-dimensional_space" title="wikilink">zero-dimensional</a> (the topology has a clopen basis: here, write an open interval (β,γ) as the union of the clopen intervals (β,γ'+1)=[β+1,γ'] for γ'<γ). However, they are not <a href="extremally_disconnected_space" title="wikilink">extremally disconnected</a> in general (there are open sets, for example the even numbers from ω, whose closure is not open).</p>
<p>The topological spaces ω<sub>1</sub> and its successor ω<sub>1</sub>+1 are frequently used as text-book examples of non-countable topological spaces. For example, in the topological space ω<sub>1</sub>+1, the element ω<sub>1</sub> is in the closure of the subset ω<sub>1</sub> even though no sequence of elements in ω<sub>1</sub> has the element ω<sub>1</sub> as its limit: an element in ω<sub>1</sub> is a countable set; for any sequence of such sets, the union of these sets is the union of countably many countable sets, so still countable; this union is an upper bound of the elements of the sequence, and therefore of the limit of the sequence, if it has one.</p>
<p>The space ω<sub>1</sub> is <a href="first-countable_space" title="wikilink">first-countable</a>, but not <a href="second-countable_space" title="wikilink">second-countable</a>, and ω<sub>1</sub>+1 has neither of these two properties, despite being <a href="compact_space" title="wikilink">compact</a>. It is also worthy of note that any continuous function from ω<sub>1</sub> to <strong>R</strong> (the <a href="real_line" title="wikilink">real line</a>) is eventually constant: so the <a href="Compactification_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">Stone-Čech compactification</a> of ω<sub>1</sub> is ω<sub>1</sub>+1, just as its one-point compactification (in sharp contrast to ω, whose Stone-Čech compactification is much <em>larger</em> than ω).</p>
<h3 id="ordinal-indexed-sequences">Ordinal-indexed sequences</h3>
<p>If α is a limit ordinal and <em>X</em> is a set, an α-indexed sequence of elements of <em>X</em> merely means a function from α to <em>X</em>. This concept, a <strong>transfinite sequence</strong> or <strong>ordinal-indexed sequence</strong>, is a generalization of the concept of a <a class="uri" href="sequence" title="wikilink">sequence</a>. An ordinary sequence corresponds to the case α = ω.</p>
<p>If <em>X</em> is a topological space, we say that an α-indexed sequence of elements of <em>X</em> <em>converges</em> to a limit <em>x</em> when it converges as a <a href="net_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">net</a>, in other words, when given any neighborhood <em>U</em> of <em>x</em> there is an ordinal β<α such that <em>x</em><sub>ι</sub> is in <em>U</em> for all ι≥β.</p>
<p>Ordinal-indexed sequences are more powerful than ordinary (ω-indexed) sequences to determine limits in topology: for example, ω<sub>1</sub> (<a href="Ordinal_number#Initial_ordinal_of_a_cardinal" title="wikilink">omega-one</a>, the set of all countable ordinal numbers, and the smallest uncountable ordinal number), is a limit point of ω<sub>1</sub>+1 (because it is a limit ordinal), and, indeed, it is the limit of the ω<sub>1</sub>-indexed sequence which maps any ordinal less than ω<sub>1</sub> to itself: however, it is not the limit of any ordinary (ω-indexed) sequence in ω<sub>1</sub>, since any such limit is less than or equal to the union of its elements, which is a countable union of countable sets, hence itself countable.</p>
<p>However, ordinal-indexed sequences are not powerful enough to replace nets (or <a href="filter_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">filters</a>) in general: for example, on the <a href="Tychonoff_plank" title="wikilink">Tychonoff plank</a> (the product space <span class="LaTeX">$(\omega_1+1)\times(\omega+1)$</span>), the corner point <span class="LaTeX">$(\omega_1,\omega)$</span> is a limit point (it is in the closure) of the open subset <span class="LaTeX">$\omega_1\times\omega$</span>, but it is not the limit of an ordinal-indexed sequence.</p>
