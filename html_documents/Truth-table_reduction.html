<h1>Truth-table reduction</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a href="computability_theory" title="wikilink">computability theory</a>, a <strong>truth-table reduction</strong> is a <a href="reduction_(complexity)" title="wikilink">reduction</a> from one set of <a href="natural_number" title="wikilink">natural numbers</a> to another. As a "tool", it is weaker than <a href="Turing_reduction" title="wikilink">Turing reduction</a>, since not every Turing reduction between sets can be performed by a truth-table reduction, but every truth-table reduction can be performed by a Turing reduction. For the same reason it is said to be a stronger reducibility than Turing reducibility, because it implies Turing reducibility. A <strong>weak truth-table reduction</strong> is a related type of reduction which is so named because it weakens the constraints placed on a truth-table reduction, and provides a weaker equivalence classification; as such, a "weak truth-table reduction" can actually be more powerful than a truth-table reduction as a "tool", and perform a reduction which is not performable by truth table.</p>

<p>A Turing reduction from a set <em>B</em> to a set <em>A</em> computes the membership of a single element in <em>B</em> by asking questions about the membership of various elements in <em>A</em> during the computation; it may adaptively determine which questions it asks based upon answers to previous questions. In contrast, a truth-table reduction or a weak truth-table reduction must present all of its (finitely many) <a href="oracle_(computer_science)" title="wikilink">oracle</a> queries at the same time. In a truth-table reduction, the reduction also gives a <a href="boolean_function" title="wikilink">boolean function</a> (a truth table) which, when given the answers to the queries, will produce the final answer of the reduction. In a weak truth-table reduction, the reduction uses the oracle answers as a basis for further computation which may depend on the given answers but may not ask further questions of the oracle.</p>

<p>Equivalently, a weak truth-table reduction is a Turing reduction for which the <a href="Turing_reduction#The_use_of_a_reduction" title="wikilink">use</a> of the reduction is bounded by a <a href="computable_function" title="wikilink">computable function</a>. For this reason, they are sometimes referred to as <strong>bounded Turing</strong> (bT) reductions rather than as weak truth-table (wtt) reductions.</p>
<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>

<p>As every truth-table reduction is a Turing reduction, if <em>A</em> is truth-table reducible to <em>B</em> (<em>A</em> ≤<sub>tt</sub> <em>B</em>), then <em>A</em> is also Turing reducible to <em>B</em> (<em>A</em> ≤<sub>T</sub> <em>B</em>). Considering also one-one reducibility, many-one reducibility and weak truth-table reducibility,</p>

, or in other words, one-one reducibility implies many-one reducibility, which implies truth-table reducibility, which in turn implies weak truth-table reducibility, which in turn implies Turing reducibility.</p>
