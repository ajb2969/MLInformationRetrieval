<h1>Cauchy's theorem (geometry)</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Cauchy's theorem</strong> is a theorem in <a class="uri" href="geometry" title="wikilink">geometry</a>, named after <a href="Augustin_Louis_Cauchy" title="wikilink">Augustin Cauchy</a>. It states that <a href="convex_polytope" title="wikilink">convex polytopes</a> in three dimensions with <a href="congruence_(geometry)" title="wikilink">congruent</a> corresponding faces must be congruent to each other. That is, any <a href="Net_(polyhedron)" title="wikilink">polyhedral net</a> formed by unfolding the faces of the polyhedron onto a flat surface, together with gluing instructions describing which faces should be connected to each other, uniquely determines the shape of the original polyhedron. For instance, if six squares are connected in the pattern of a cube, then they must form a cube: there is no convex polyhedron with six square faces connected in the same way that does not have the same shape.</p>

<p>This is a fundamental result in <a href="rigidity_theory_(structural)" title="wikilink">rigidity theory</a>: one consequence of the theorem is that, if one makes a physical model of a <a href="convex_polyhedron" title="wikilink">convex polyhedron</a> by connecting together rigid plates for each of the polyhedron faces with flexible hinges along the polyhedron edges, then this ensemble of plates and hinges will necessarily form a rigid structure.</p>
<h2 id="statement">Statement</h2>

<p>Let <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> be <em>combinatorially equivalent</em> 3-dimensional convex polytopes; that is, they are convex polytopes with isomorphic <a href="face_lattice" title="wikilink">face lattices</a>. Suppose further that each pair of corresponding faces from <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> are congruent to each other, i.e. equal up to a rigid motion. Then <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> are themselves congruent.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The result originated in <a href="Euclid" title="wikilink">Euclid's</a> <em><a href="Euclid's_Elements" title="wikilink">Elements</a></em>, where solids are called equal if the same holds for their faces. This version of the result was proved by Cauchy in 1813 based on earlier work by <a href="Joseph_Louis_Lagrange" title="wikilink">Lagrange</a>. A technical mistake was found by <a href="Ernst_Steinitz" title="wikilink">Steinitz</a> in 1920's and later corrected by him (1928) and <a href="Aleksandr_Danilovich_Aleksandrov" title="wikilink">Alexandrov</a> (1950). A definitive modern version of the proof was given by Stoker (1968).</p>

: there exist non-convex <a href="flexible_polyhedra" title="wikilink">flexible polyhedra</a> that have one or more degrees of freedom of movement that preserve the shapes of their faces. In particular, <em>Connelly' sphere</em>, a flexible non-convex polyhedron homeomorphic to a 2-sphere was discovered by <a href="Robert_Connelly" title="wikilink">Robert Connelly</a> in 1977.</li>
<li>Although originally proven by Cauchy in three dimensions, the theorem was extended to dimensions higher than 3 by <a href="Aleksandr_Danilovich_Aleksandrov" title="wikilink">Alexandrov</a> (1950).</li>
<li><strong>Cauchy's rigidity theorem</strong> is a corollary from Cauchy's theorem stating that a convex polytope cannot be deformed so that its faces remain rigid.</li>
<li>In 1974 Herman Gluck showed that in a certain precise sense <em>almost all</em> (non-convex) polyhedra are rigid.</li>
<li><strong>Dehn's rigidity theorem</strong> is an extension of the Cauchy rigidity theorem to infinitesimal rigidity. This result was obtained by <a href="Max_Dehn" title="wikilink">Dehn</a> in 1916.</li>
<li><strong><a href="Alexandrov's_uniqueness_theorem" title="wikilink">Alexandrov's uniqueness theorem</a></strong> is a result by <a href="Aleksandr_Danilovich_Aleksandrov" title="wikilink">Alexandrov</a> (1950), generalizing Cauchy's theorem by showing that convex polyhedra are uniquely described by the <a href="metric_space" title="wikilink">metric spaces</a> of <a href="geodesic" title="wikilink">geodesics</a> on their surface. The analogous uniqueness theorem for smooth surfaces was proved by <a href="Stephan_Cohn-Vossen" title="wikilink">Cohn-Vossen</a> in 1927. <strong>Pogorelov's uniqueness theorem</strong> is a result by <a href="Aleksei_Pogorelov" title="wikilink">Pogorelov</a> generalizing both of these results and applying to general convex surfaces.</li>
