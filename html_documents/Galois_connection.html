<h1>Galois connection</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, especially in <a href="order_theory" title="wikilink">order theory</a>, a <strong>Galois connection</strong> is a particular correspondence (typically) between two <a href="partially_ordered_set" title="wikilink">partially ordered sets</a> (posets). The same notion can also be defined on <a href="preordered_set" title="wikilink">preordered sets</a> or <a href="preordered_class" title="wikilink">classes</a>; this article presents the common case of posets. Galois connections generalize the correspondence between <a href="subgroup" title="wikilink">subgroups</a> and <a href="field_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">subfields</a> investigated in <a href="Galois_theory" title="wikilink">Galois theory</a> (named after the French mathematician <a href="Évariste_Galois" title="wikilink">Évariste Galois</a>). They find applications in various mathematical theories.</p>
<p>A Galois connection is rather weak compared to an <a href="order_isomorphism" title="wikilink">order isomorphism</a> between the involved posets, but every Galois connection gives rise to an isomorphism of certain sub-posets, as will be explained below.</p>
<p>The literature contains two closely related notions of "Galois connection". In this article, we will distinguish between the two by referring to the first as <strong>(monotone) Galois connection</strong> and to the second as <strong>antitone Galois connection</strong>.</p>
<p>The term <strong>Galois correspondence</strong> is sometimes used to mean <a class="uri" href="bijective" title="wikilink">bijective</a> <em>Galois connection</em>, just is simply an <a href="order_isomorphism" title="wikilink">order isomorphism</a> (or dual order isomorphism, dependently on whether we take monotone or antitone Galois connections).</p>

<p>Let <span class="LaTeX">$( A , ≤)$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$( B , ≤)$</span> be two <a href="partially_ordered_set" title="wikilink">partially ordered sets</a>. A <em>monotone Galois connection</em> between these posets consists of two <a href="monotone_function" title="wikilink">monotone</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="function_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">functions</a>: <span class="LaTeX">$F : A → B$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$G : B → A$</span>, such that for all <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$b$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span>, we have</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>In this situation, <span class="LaTeX">$F$</span> is called the <strong>lower adjoint</strong> of <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> is called the <strong>upper adjoint</strong> of <em>F</em>. Mnemonically, the upper/lower terminology refers to where the function application appears relative to ≤;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> the term "adjoint" refers to the fact that monotone Galois connections are special cases of pairs of <a href="adjoint_functor" title="wikilink">adjoint functors</a> in <a href="category_theory" title="wikilink">category theory</a> as discussed further below. Other terminology encountered here is <strong>left adjoint</strong> (resp. <strong>right adjoint</strong>) for the lower (resp. upper) adjoint.</p>
<p>An essential property of a Galois connection is that an upper/lower adjoint of a Galois connection <em>uniquely</em> determines the other:</p>
<dl>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$F ( a )$</span> is the least element <span class="LaTeX">$$</span> with <span class="LaTeX">$a ≤ G (  )$</span>, and
</dd>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$G ( b )$</span> is the largest element <span class="LaTeX">$$</span> with <span class="LaTeX">$F (  ) ≤ b$</span>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A consequence of this is that if <span class="LaTeX">$F$</span> or <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> is <a href="Bijection" title="wikilink">invertible</a>, then each is the <a href="Inverse_function" title="wikilink">inverse</a> of the other, i.e. <mtpl></mtpl> .</p>
<p>Given a Galois connection with lower adjoint <span class="LaTeX">$F$</span> and upper adjoint <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span>, we can consider the compositions <span class="LaTeX">$GF : A → A$</span>, known as the associated <a href="closure_operator" title="wikilink">closure operator</a>, and <span class="LaTeX">$FG : B → B$</span>, known as the associated kernel operator. Both are monotone and idempotent, and we have <span class="LaTeX">$a ≤ GF ( a )$</span> for all <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$FG ( b ) ≤ b$</span> for all <span class="LaTeX">$b$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span>.</p>
<p>A <strong>Galois insertion</strong> of <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> into <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span> is a Galois connection in which the closure operator <span class="LaTeX">$GF$</span> is the identity on <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="antitone-galois-connection">Antitone Galois connection</h3>
<p>The above definition is common in many applications today, and prominent in <a href="lattice_(order)" title="wikilink">lattice</a> and <a href="domain_theory" title="wikilink">domain theory</a>. However the original notion in Galois theory is slightly different. In this alternative definition, a Galois connection is a pair of <em>antitone</em>, i.e. order-reversing, functions <span class="LaTeX">$F : A → B$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$G : B → A$</span> between two posets <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span>, such that</p>
<dl>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$b ≤ F ( a )$</span> if and only if <span class="LaTeX">$a ≤ G ( b )$</span>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The symmetry of <span class="LaTeX">$F$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> in this version erases the distinction between upper and lower, and the two functions are then called <strong>polarities</strong> rather than adjoints.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Each polarity uniquely determines the other, since</p>
<dl>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$F ( a )$</span> is the largest element <span class="LaTeX">$b$</span> with <span class="LaTeX">$a ≤ G ( b )$</span>, and
</dd>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$G ( b )$</span> is the largest element <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span> with <span class="LaTeX">$b ≤ F ( a )$</span>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The compositions <span class="LaTeX">$GF : A → A$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$FG : B → B$</span> are the associated closure operators; they are monotone idempotent maps with the property <span class="LaTeX">$a ≤ GF ( a )$</span> for all <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$b ≤ FG ( b )$</span> for all <span class="LaTeX">$b$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span>.</p>
<p>The implications of the two definitions of Galois connections are very similar, since an antitone Galois connection between <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span> is just a monotone Galois connection between <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> and the <a href="duality_(order_theory)" title="wikilink">order dual</a> <mtpl></mtpl> of <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span>. All of the below statements on Galois connections can thus easily be converted into statements about antitone Galois connections.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<h3 id="monotone-galois-connections">Monotone Galois connections</h3>
<h4 id="power-set-implication-and-conjunction">Power set; implication and conjunction</h4>
<p>For an order theoretic example, let <span class="LaTeX">$U$</span> be some <a href="Set_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">set</a>, and let <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span> both be the <a href="power_set" title="wikilink">power set</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$U$</span>, ordered by inclusion. Pick a fixed subset <span class="LaTeX">$L$</span> of <span class="LaTeX">$U$</span>. Then the maps <span class="LaTeX">$F$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span>, where <span class="LaTeX">$F ( M ) = L ∩ M$</span>, and <span class="LaTeX">$G ( N ) = N ∪ ( U \ L )$</span>, form a monotone Galois connection, with <span class="LaTeX">$F$</span> being the lower adjoint. A similar Galois connection whose lower adjoint is given by the meet (infimum) operation can be found in any <a href="Heyting_algebra" title="wikilink">Heyting algebra</a>. Especially, it is present in any <a href="Boolean_algebra_(structure)" title="wikilink">Boolean algebra</a>, where the two mappings can be described by <span class="LaTeX">$F ( x ) = ( a ∧ x )$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$G ( y ) = ( y ∨ ¬ a ) = ( a ⇒ y )$</span>. In logical terms: "implication from <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span>" is the upper adjoint of "conjunction with <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span>".</p>
<h4 id="lattices">Lattices</h4>
<p>Further interesting examples for Galois connections are described in the article on <a href="completeness_(order_theory)" title="wikilink">completeness properties</a>. Roughly speaking, it turns out that the usual functions ∨ and ∧ are lower and upper adjoints to the diagonal map <span class="LaTeX">$X → X × X$</span>. The least and greatest elements of a partial order are given by lower and upper adjoints to the unique function  Going further, even <a href="complete_lattice" title="wikilink">complete lattices</a> can be characterized by the existence of suitable adjoints. These considerations give some impression of the ubiquity of Galois connections in order theory.</p>
<h4 id="transitive-group-actions">Transitive group actions</h4>
<p>Let <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> act <a href="Group_action#Types_of_actions" title="wikilink">transitively</a> on <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span> and pick some point <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span>. Consider</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\mathcal{B} = \{B \subseteq X : x \in B; \forall g \in G, gB = B \ \mathrm{or} \ gB \cap B = \emptyset\},$$</span></p>
<p>the set of <strong>blocks</strong> containing <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>. Further, let <span class="LaTeX">$\mathcal{G}$</span> consist of the subgroups of <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> containing the <a href="Group_action#Orbits_and_stabilizers" title="wikilink">stabilizer</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>.</p>
<p>Then, the correspondence <span class="LaTeX">$\mathcal{B} \to \mathcal{G}$</span>:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$B \mapsto H_B = \{g \in G : gx \in B\}$$</span> is a monotone, one-to-one Galois connection.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> As a corollary, one can establish that doubly transitive actions have no blocks other than the trivial ones (singletons or the whole of <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span>): this follows from the stabilizers being maximal in <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> in that case. See <a href="2-transitive_group" title="wikilink">doubly transitive group</a> for further discussion.</p>
<h4 id="image-and-inverse-image">Image and inverse image</h4>
<p>If <span class="LaTeX">$f : X → Y$</span> is a <a href="function_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">function</a>, then for any subset <span class="LaTeX">$M$</span> of <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span> we can form the image  and for any subset <span class="LaTeX">$N$</span> of <span class="LaTeX">$Y$</span> we can form the inverse image  Then <span class="LaTeX">$F$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> form a monotone Galois connection between the power set of <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span> and the power set of <span class="LaTeX">$Y$</span>, both ordered by inclusion ⊆. There is a further adjoint pair in this situation: for a subset <span class="LaTeX">$M$</span> of <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span>, define  Then <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$H$</span> form a monotone Galois connection between the power set of <span class="LaTeX">$Y$</span> and the power set of <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span>. In the first Galois connection, <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> is the upper adjoint, while in the second Galois connection it serves as the lower adjoint.</p>
<p>In the case of a <a href="quotient_group" title="wikilink">quotient map</a> between algebraic objects (such as groups), this connection is called the <a href="lattice_theorem" title="wikilink">lattice theorem</a>: subgroups of <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> connect to subgroups of <span class="LaTeX">$G / N$</span>, and the closure operator on subgroups of <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> is given by <span class="LaTeX">$\overline{H} = HN$</span>.</p>
<h4 id="span-and-closure">Span and closure</h4>
<p>Pick some mathematical object <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span> that has an underlying set, for instance a <a href="group_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">group</a>, <a href="ring_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">ring</a>, <a href="vector_space" title="wikilink">vector space</a>, etc. For any subset <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span> of <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span>, let <span class="LaTeX">$F ( S )$</span> be the smallest subobject of <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span> that contains <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span>, i.e. the <a class="uri" href="subgroup" title="wikilink">subgroup</a>, <a class="uri" href="subring" title="wikilink">subring</a> or <a href="linear_subspace" title="wikilink">subspace</a> generated by <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span>. For any subobject <span class="LaTeX">$U$</span> of <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span>, let <span class="LaTeX">$G ( U )$</span> be the underlying set of <span class="LaTeX">$U$</span>. (We can even take <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span> to be a <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topological space</a>, let <span class="LaTeX">$F ( S )$</span> the <a href="closure_(topology)" title="wikilink">closure</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span>, and take as "subobjects of <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span>" the closed subsets of <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span>.) Now <span class="LaTeX">$F$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> form a monotone Galois connection between subsets of <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span> and subobjects of <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span>, if both are ordered by inclusion. <span class="LaTeX">$F$</span> is the lower adjoint.</p>
<h4 id="syntax-and-semantics">Syntax and semantics</h4>
<p>A very general comment of <a href="William_Lawvere" title="wikilink">William Lawvere</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> is that <em>syntax and semantics</em> are adjoint: take <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> to be the set of all logical theories (axiomatizations), and <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span> the power set of the set of all mathematical structures. For a theory <span class="LaTeX">$T ∈ A$</span>, let <span class="LaTeX">$F ( T )$</span> be the set of all structures that satisfy the axioms <span class="LaTeX">$T$</span>; for a set of mathematical structures <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span>, let <span class="LaTeX">$G ( S )$</span> be the minimum of the axiomatizations which approximate <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span>. We can then say that <span class="LaTeX">$F ( T )$</span> is a subset of <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span> if and only if <span class="LaTeX">$T$</span> logically implies <span class="LaTeX">$G ( S )$</span>: the "semantics functor" <span class="LaTeX">$F$</span> and the "syntax functor" <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> form a monotone Galois connection, with semantics being the lower adjoint.</p>
<h3 id="antitone-galois-connections">Antitone galois connections</h3>
<h4 id="galois-theory">Galois theory</h4>
<p>The motivating example comes from Galois theory: suppose <span class="LaTeX">$L / K$</span> is a <a href="field_extension" title="wikilink">field extension</a>. Let <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> be the set of all subfields of <span class="LaTeX">$L$</span> that contain <span class="LaTeX">$K$</span>, ordered by inclusion ⊆. If <span class="LaTeX">$E$</span> is such a subfield, write <span class="LaTeX">$Gal( L / E )$</span> for the group of field automorphisms of <span class="LaTeX">$L$</span> that hold <span class="LaTeX">$E$</span> fixed. Let <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span> be the set of <a href="subgroup" title="wikilink">subgroups</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$Gal( L / K )$</span>, ordered by inclusion ⊆. For such a subgroup <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span>, define <span class="LaTeX">$Fix( G )$</span> to be the field consisting of all elements of <span class="LaTeX">$L$</span> that are held fixed by all elements of <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span>. Then the maps <span class="LaTeX">$E \mapsto Gal( L / E )$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$G \mapsto Fix( G )$</span> form an antitone Galois connection.</p>
<h4 id="algebraic-topology-covering-spaces">Algebraic topology: covering spaces</h4>
<p>Analogously, given a <a class="uri" href="path-connected" title="wikilink">path-connected</a> <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topological space</a> <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span>, there is an antitone Galois connection between subgroups of the fundamental group <mtpl></mtpl> and <a class="uri" href="path-connected" title="wikilink">path-connected</a> covering spaces of <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span>. In particular, if <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span> is <a href="semi-locally_simply_connected" title="wikilink">semi-locally simply connected</a>, then for every subgroup <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> of <mtpl></mtpl>, there is a covering space with <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> as its fundamental group.</p>
<h4 id="linear-algebra-annihilators-and-orthogonal-complements">Linear algebra: annihilators and orthogonal complements</h4>
<p>Given an <a href="inner_product_space" title="wikilink">inner product space</a> <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span>, we can form the <a href="orthogonal_complement" title="wikilink">orthogonal complement</a> <span class="LaTeX">$F ( X )$</span> of any subspace <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span> of <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span>. This yields an antitone Galois connection between the set of subspaces of <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> and itself, ordered by inclusion; both polarities are equal to <span class="LaTeX">$F$</span>.</p>
<p>Given a <a href="vector_space" title="wikilink">vector space</a> <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> and a subset <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span> of <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> we can define its annihilator <span class="LaTeX">$F ( X )$</span>, consisting of all elements of the <a href="dual_space" title="wikilink">dual space</a> <mtpl></mtpl> of <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> that vanish on <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span>. Similarly, given a subset <span class="LaTeX">$Y$</span> of <mtpl></mtpl>, we define its annihilator  This gives an antitone Galois connection between the subsets of <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> and the subsets of <mtpl></mtpl>.</p>
<h4 id="algebraic-geometry">Algebraic geometry</h4>
<p>In <a href="algebraic_geometry" title="wikilink">algebraic geometry</a>, the relation between sets of <a href="polynomial" title="wikilink">polynomials</a> and their zero sets is an antitone Galois connection.</p>
<p>Fix a <a href="natural_number" title="wikilink">natural number</a> <span class="LaTeX">$n$</span> and a <a href="field_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">field</a> <span class="LaTeX">$K$</span> and let <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> be the set of all subsets of the <a href="polynomial_ring" title="wikilink">polynomial ring</a> <mtpl></mtpl> ordered by inclusion ⊆, and let <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span> be the set of all subsets of <mtpl></mtpl> ordered by inclusion ⊆. If <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span> is a set of polynomials, define the <a href="Algebraic_geometry#Affine_varieties" title="wikilink">variety</a> of zeros as</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$V(S) = \{x \in K^n : f(x) = 0 \mbox{ for all } f \in S\},$$</span></p>
<p>the set of common zeros of the polynomials in <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span>. If <span class="LaTeX">$U$</span> is a subset of <mtpl></mtpl>, define <span class="LaTeX">$I ( U )$</span> as an ideal of polynomials vanishing on <span class="LaTeX">$U$</span>, that is</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$I(U) = \{ f \in K[X_1,\cdots,X_n] : f(x) = 0 \mbox{ for all } x \in U\}.$$</span></p>
<p>Then <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> and <em>I</em> form an antitone Galois connection.</p>
<p>The closure on <mtpl></mtpl> is the closure in the <a href="Zariski_topology" title="wikilink">Zariski topology</a>, and if the field <span class="LaTeX">$K$</span> is <a href="Algebraically_closed_field" title="wikilink">algebraically closed</a>, then the closure on the polynomial ring is the <a href="Radical_of_an_ideal" title="wikilink">radical</a> of ideal generated by <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span>.</p>
<p>More generally, given a <a href="commutative_ring" title="wikilink">commutative ring</a> <span class="LaTeX">$R$</span> (not necessarily a polynomial ring), there is an antitone Galois connection between radical ideals in the ring and subvarieties of the <a href="Algebraic_geometry#Affine_varieties" title="wikilink">affine variety</a> <a href="Spectrum_of_a_ring" title="wikilink"><span class="LaTeX">$Spec( R )$</span></a>.</p>
<p>More generally, there is an antitone Galois connection between ideals in the ring and <a href="subscheme" title="wikilink">subschemes</a> of the corresponding <a href="Algebraic_geometry#Affine_varieties" title="wikilink">affine variety</a>.</p>
<h4 id="connections-on-power-sets-arising-from-binary-relations">Connections on power sets arising from binary relations</h4>
<p>Suppose <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$Y$</span> are arbitrary sets and a <a href="binary_relation" title="wikilink">binary relation</a> <span class="LaTeX">$R$</span> over <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$Y$</span> is given. For any subset <span class="LaTeX">$M$</span> of <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span>, we define  Similarly, for any subset <span class="LaTeX">$N$</span> of <span class="LaTeX">$Y$</span>, define  Then <span class="LaTeX">$F$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> yield an antitone Galois connection between the power sets of <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$Y$</span>, both ordered by inclusion ⊆.</p>
<p>Many antitone Galois connections arise in this way; examples include the original connection from Galois theory, the connections in linear algebra and the connection from algebraic geometry explained above.</p>
<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>
<p>In the following, we consider a (monotone) Galois connection <mtpl> ( <em>f</em> <sup>∗</sup>,  <em>f</em><sub>∗</sub>)}}</mtpl>, where <mtpl></mtpl> is the lower adjoint as introduced above. Some helpful and instructive basic properties can be obtained immediately. By the defining property of Galois connections, <mtpl></mtpl> is equivalent to <mtpl></mtpl>, for all <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span>. By a similar reasoning (or just by applying the <a href="duality_(order_theory)" title="wikilink">duality principle for order theory</a>), one finds that <mtpl></mtpl>, for all <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span>. These properties can be described by saying the composite <mtpl></mtpl> is <em>deflationary</em>, while <mtpl></mtpl> is <em>inflationary</em> (or <em>extensive</em>).</p>
<p>Now consider <span class="LaTeX">$x , y ∈ A$</span> such that <span class="LaTeX">$x ≤ y$</span>, then using the above one obtains <mtpl></mtpl>. Applying the basic property of Galois connections, one can now conclude that <mtpl></mtpl>. But this just shows that <mtpl></mtpl> preserves the order of any two elements, i.e. it is monotone. Again, a similar reasoning yields monotonicity of <mtpl></mtpl>. Thus monotonicity does not have to be included in the definition explicitly. However, mentioning monotonicity helps to avoid confusion about the two alternative notions of Galois connections.</p>
<p>Another basic property of Galois connections is the fact that <mtpl>  <em>f</em><sub>∗</sub>(<em>x</em>)}}</mtpl>, for all <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span>. Clearly we find that</p>
<dl>
<dd><mtpl></mtpl>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>because <mtpl></mtpl> is inflationary as shown above. On the other hand, since <mtpl></mtpl> is deflationary, while <mtpl></mtpl> is monotonic, one finds that</p>
<dl>
<dd><mtpl></mtpl>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This shows the desired equality. Furthermore, we can use this property to conclude that</p>
<dl>
<dd><mtpl>  <em>f</em> <sup>∗</sup>( <em>f</em><sub>∗</sub>(<em>x</em>))}}</mtpl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>and</p>
<dl>
<dd><mtpl>  <em>f</em><sub>∗</sub>( <em>f</em> <sup>∗</sup>(<em>x</em>))}}</mtpl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>i.e., <mtpl></mtpl> and <mtpl></mtpl> are <a class="uri" href="idempotent" title="wikilink">idempotent</a>.</p>
<p>It can be shown (see Blyth or Erné for proofs) that a function <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> is a lower (resp. upper) adjoint if and only if <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> is a <a href="residuated_mapping" title="wikilink">residuated mapping</a> (resp. residual mapping). Therefore, the notion of residuated mapping and monotone Galois connection are essentially the same.</p>

<p>The above findings can be summarized as follows: for a Galois connection, the composite <mtpl></mtpl> is monotone (being the composite of monotone functions), inflationary, and idempotent. This states that <mtpl></mtpl> is in fact a <a href="closure_operator" title="wikilink">closure operator</a> on <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span>. Dually, <mtpl></mtpl> is monotone, deflationary, and idempotent. Such mappings are sometimes called <strong>kernel operators</strong>. In the context of <a href="frames_and_locales" title="wikilink">frames and locales</a>, the composite <mtpl></mtpl> is called the <strong>nucleus</strong> induced by <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span>. Nuclei induce frame homomorphisms; a subset of a locale is called a <a class="uri" href="sublocale" title="wikilink">sublocale</a> if it is given by a nucleus.</p>
<p>Conversely, any closure operator <span class="LaTeX">$c$</span> on some poset <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> gives rise to the Galois connection with lower adjoint <mtpl></mtpl> being just the corestriction of <span class="LaTeX">$c$</span> to the image of <span class="LaTeX">$c$</span> (i.e. as a surjective mapping the closure system <span class="LaTeX">$c ( A )$</span>). The upper adjoint <mtpl></mtpl> is then given by the inclusion of <span class="LaTeX">$c ( A )$</span> into <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span>, that maps each closed element to itself, considered as an element of <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span>. In this way, closure operators and Galois connections are seen to be closely related, each specifying an instance of the other. Similar conclusions hold true for kernel operators.</p>
<p>The above considerations also show that closed elements of <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> (elements <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> with <mtpl> <em>x</em>}}</mtpl>) are mapped to elements within the range of the kernel operator <mtpl></mtpl>, and vice versa.</p>
<h2 id="existence-and-uniqueness-of-galois-connections">Existence and uniqueness of Galois connections</h2>
<p>Another important property of Galois connections is that lower adjoints <a href="limit_preserving_(order_theory)" title="wikilink">preserve</a> all <a href="supremum" title="wikilink">suprema</a> that exist within their <a href="function_domain" title="wikilink">domain</a>. Dually, upper adjoints preserve all existing <a href="infimum" title="wikilink">infima</a>. From these properties, one can also conclude monotonicity of the adjoints immediately. The <a href="adjoint_functor_theorem_(order_theory)" title="wikilink">adjoint functor theorem for order theory</a> states that the converse implication is also valid in certain cases: especially, any mapping between <a href="complete_lattice" title="wikilink">complete lattices</a> that preserves all suprema is the lower adjoint of a Galois connection.</p>
<p>In this situation, an important feature of Galois connections is that one adjoint uniquely determines the other. Hence one can strengthen the above statement to guarantee that any supremum-preserving map between complete lattices is the lower adjoint of a unique Galois connection. The main property to derive this uniqueness is the following: For every <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span>, <mtpl></mtpl> is the least element <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span> of <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span> such that <mtpl></mtpl>. Dually, for every <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span>, <mtpl></mtpl> is the greatest <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> such that <mtpl></mtpl>. The existence of a certain Galois connection now implies the existence of the respective least or greatest elements, no matter whether the corresponding posets satisfy any <a href="completeness_(order_theory)" title="wikilink">completeness properties</a>. Thus, when one upper adjoint of a Galois connection is given, the other upper adjoint can be defined via this same property.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some monotone function <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> is a lower adjoint <a href="if_and_only_if" title="wikilink">if and only if</a> each set of the form  for <span class="LaTeX">$b$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span>, contains a greatest element. Again, this can be dualized for the upper adjoint.</p>
<h2 id="galois-connections-as-morphisms">Galois connections as morphisms</h2>
<p>Galois connections also provide an interesting class of mappings between posets which can be used to obtain <a href="category_theory" title="wikilink">categories</a> of posets. Especially, it is possible to compose Galois connections: given Galois connections <mtpl></mtpl> between posets <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span> and <mtpl></mtpl> between <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$C$</span>, the composite <mtpl></mtpl> is also a Galois connection. When considering categories of complete lattices, this can be simplified to considering just mappings preserving all suprema (or, alternatively, infima). Mapping complete lattices to their duals, this categories display auto <a href="duality_(category_theory)" title="wikilink">duality</a>, that are quite fundamental for obtaining other duality theorems. More special kinds of morphisms that induce adjoint mappings in the other direction are the morphisms usually considered for <a href="complete_Heyting_algebra" title="wikilink">frames</a> (or locales).</p>
<h2 id="connection-to-category-theory">Connection to category theory</h2>
<p>Every partially ordered set can be viewed as a <a href="category_theory" title="wikilink">category</a> in a natural way: there is a unique morphism from <em>x</em> to <em>y</em> <a href="if_and_only_if" title="wikilink">if and only if</a> <span class="LaTeX">$x ≤ y$</span>. A monotone Galois connection is then nothing but a pair of <a href="adjoint_functors" title="wikilink">adjoint functors</a> between two categories that arise from partially ordered sets. In this context, the upper adjoint is the <em>right adjoint</em> while the lower adjoint is the <em>left adjoint</em>. However, this terminology is avoided for Galois connections, since there was a time when posets were transformed into categories in a <a href="dual_(category_theory)" title="wikilink">dual</a> fashion, i.e. with arrows pointing in the opposite direction. This led to a complementary notation concerning left and right adjoints, which today is ambiguous.</p>
