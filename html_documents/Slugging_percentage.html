<p>In <a href="baseball_statistics" title="wikilink">baseball statistics</a>, <strong>slugging percentage</strong> (abbreviated <strong>SLG</strong>) is a popular measure of the power of a <a href="batting_(baseball)" title="wikilink">hitter</a>. It is calculated as <a href="total_bases" title="wikilink">total bases</a> divided by <a href="at_bat" title="wikilink">at bats</a>:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$SLG = \frac{(\mathit{1B}) + (2 \times \mathit{2B}) + (3 \times \mathit{3B}) + (4 \times \mathit{HR})}{AB}$</span></p>
<p>where <em>AB</em> is the number of at-bats for a given player, and <em>1B</em>, <em>2B</em>, <em>3B</em>, and <em>HR</em> are the number of <a href="single_(baseball)" title="wikilink">singles</a>, <a href="double_(baseball)" title="wikilink">doubles</a>, <a href="triple_(baseball)" title="wikilink">triples</a>, and <a href="home_run" title="wikilink">home runs</a>, respectively. <a href="Base_on_balls" title="wikilink">Walks</a> are specifically excluded from this calculation. The name is a <a class="uri" href="misnomer" title="wikilink">misnomer</a>, as the statistic is not a <a class="uri" href="percentage" title="wikilink">percentage</a> but a scale of <a href="Measure_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">measure</a> whose computed value is a <a href="rational_number" title="wikilink">rational number</a> in the <a href="Interval_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">interval</a> <span class="LaTeX">$\left[0, 4\right]$</span>.</p>
<p>For example, in 1920, <a href="Babe_Ruth" title="wikilink">Babe Ruth</a> played his first season for the <a href="New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">New York Yankees</a>. In 458 at bats, Ruth had 172 hits, comprising 73 singles, 36 doubles, 9 triples, and 54 home runs, which brings the total base count to (73 × 1) + (36 × 2) + (9 × 3) + (54 × 4) = 388. His total number of bases (388) divided by his total at-bats (458) is .847, his slugging percentage for the season. The next year he slugged .846, and these records went unbroken until <a href="2001_in_baseball" title="wikilink">2001</a>, when <a href="Barry_Bonds" title="wikilink">Barry Bonds</a> achieved 411 bases in 476 at-bats, bringing his slugging percentage to .863, unmatched since.</p>
<h2 id="significance">Significance</h2>
<p>Long after it was first invented, slugging percentage gained new significance when baseball analysts realized that it combined with <a href="on-base_percentage" title="wikilink">on-base percentage</a> (OBP) to form a very good measure of a player's overall offensive production (in fact, OBP + SLG was originally referred to as "production" by baseball writer and statistician <a href="Bill_James" title="wikilink">Bill James</a>). A predecessor metric was developed by <a href="Branch_Rickey" title="wikilink">Branch Rickey</a> in 1954. Rickey, in <em><a href="Life_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Life</a></em> magazine, suggested that combining OBP with what he called "extra base power" (EBP) would give a better indicator of player performance than typical <a href="Triple_Crown_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Triple Crown</a> stats. EBP was a predecessor to slugging percentage.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Allen_Barra" title="wikilink">Allen Barra</a> and <a href="George_Ignatin" title="wikilink">George Ignatin</a> were early adopters in combining the two modern-day statistics, multiplying them together to form what is now known as "SLOB" (Slugging × On-Base).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <a href="Bill_James" title="wikilink">Bill James</a> applied this principle to his <a href="runs_created" title="wikilink">runs created</a> formula several years later (and perhaps independently), essentially multiplying SLOB × At-Bats to create the formula:</p>
<p> <span class="LaTeX">$\text{RC}=\frac{(\text{Hits}+\text{Walks})(\text{Total Bases})}{\text{At Bats}+\text{Walks}}$</span></p>
<p>In 1984, <a href="Pete_Palmer" title="wikilink">Pete Palmer</a> and <a href="John_Thorn" title="wikilink">John Thorn</a> developed perhaps the most widespread means of combining slugging and on-base percentage: <a href="On-base_plus_slugging" title="wikilink">OPS</a>. "OPS" simply stands for "on-base plus slugging", and is a simple addition of the two values. Because it is easy to calculate, OPS has been used with increased frequency in recent years as a shorthand form to evaluate contributions as a <a href="Batting_(baseball)" title="wikilink">batter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="perfect-slugging-percentage">Perfect slugging percentage</h2>
<p>The maximum numerically possible slugging percentage is 4.000. A few dozen players throughout history (107 as of August 2010) have momentarily had a 4.0 career average by homering in their first major league at-bat.</p>
<p>No player has ever retired with a 4.000 slugging percentage, but four players tripled in their only at-bat and therefore share the ML record, when calculated without respect to games played or plate appearances, of a career slugging percentage of 3.000. The players (and the seasons in which they had their only at-bat) were: <a href="Eric_Cammack" title="wikilink">Eric Cammack</a> (2000 Mets); <a href="Scott_Munninghoff" title="wikilink">Scott Munninghoff</a> (1980 Phillies); <a href="Eduardo_Rodríguez_(right-handed_pitcher)" title="wikilink">Eduardo Rodriguez</a> (1973 Brewers); and <a href="Charlie_Lindstrom" title="wikilink">Charlie Lindstrom</a> (1958 White Sox).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
