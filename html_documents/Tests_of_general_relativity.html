<h1>Tests of general relativity</h1>
<hr/>

<p>At its introduction in 1915, the <a href="general_relativity" title="wikilink">general theory of relativity</a> did not have a solid <a href="empirical_evidence" title="wikilink">empirical foundation</a>. It was known that it correctly accounted for the "anomalous" <a class="uri" href="precession" title="wikilink">precession</a> of the <a class="uri" href="perihelion" title="wikilink">perihelion</a> of <a href="Mercury_(planet)" title="wikilink">Mercury</a> and on philosophical grounds it was considered satisfying that it was able to unify <a href="Isaac_Newton" title="wikilink">Newton</a>'s <a href="law_of_universal_gravitation" title="wikilink">law of universal gravitation</a> with <a href="special_relativity" title="wikilink">special relativity</a>. That light appeared to bend in gravitational fields in line with the predictions of general relativity was found in 1919 but it was not until a program of precision tests was started in 1959 that the various predictions of general relativity were tested to any further degree of accuracy in the weak gravitational field limit, severely limiting possible deviations from the theory. Beginning in 1974, <a href="Russell_Alan_Hulse" title="wikilink">Hulse</a>, <a href="Joseph_Hooton_Taylor,_Jr." title="wikilink">Taylor</a> and others have studied the behaviour of <a href="binary_pulsar" title="wikilink">binary pulsars</a> experiencing much stronger gravitational fields than found in our solar system. Both in the weak field limit (as in our solar system) and with the stronger fields present in systems of binary pulsars the predictions of general relativity have been extremely well tested locally.</p>

<p>The very strong gravitational fields that must be present close to <a href="black_hole" title="wikilink">black holes</a>, especially those <a href="supermassive_black_hole" title="wikilink">supermassive black holes</a> which are thought to power <a href="active_galactic_nuclei" title="wikilink">active galactic nuclei</a> and the more active <a href="quasar" title="wikilink">quasars</a>, belong to a field of intense active research. Observations of these quasars and active galactic nuclei are difficult, and interpretation of the observations is heavily dependent upon astrophysical models other than general relativity or competing fundamental <a href="Alternatives_to_general_relativity" title="wikilink">theories of gravitation</a>, but they are qualitatively consistent with the black hole concept as modelled in general relativity.</p>

<p>As a consequence of the <a href="equivalence_principle" title="wikilink">equivalence principle</a>, <a href="Lorentz_invariance" title="wikilink">Lorentz invariance</a> holds locally in freely falling reference frames. Experiments related to Lorentz invariance and thus <a href="special_relativity" title="wikilink">special relativity</a> (i.e., when gravitational effects can be neglected) are described in <a href="Tests_of_special_relativity" title="wikilink">Tests of special relativity</a>.</p>
<h2 id="classical-tests">Classical tests</h2>

<p><a href="Albert_Einstein" title="wikilink">Albert Einstein</a> proposed three tests of general relativity, subsequently called <strong>the classical tests of general relativity</strong>, in 1916:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li>the perihelion precession of <a href="Mercury_(planet)" title="wikilink">Mercury</a>'s orbit</li>
<li>the <a href="gravitational_lens" title="wikilink">deflection of light</a> by the <a class="uri" href="Sun" title="wikilink">Sun</a></li>
<li>the <a href="gravitational_redshift" title="wikilink">gravitational redshift</a> of light</li>
</ol>

<p>In the letter to the <a href="The_Times" title="wikilink">London Times</a> on November 28, 1919, he described the theory of relativity and thanked his English colleagues for their understanding and testing of his work. He also mentioned three classical tests with comments:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="perihelion-precession-of-mercury">Perihelion precession of Mercury</h3>

<p> </p>

<p>Under Newtonian physics, a two-body system consisting of a lone object orbiting a spherical mass would trace out an <a class="uri" href="ellipse" title="wikilink">ellipse</a> with the spherical mass at a <a href="focus_(geometry)" title="wikilink">focus</a>. The point of closest approach, called the <a class="uri" href="periapsis" title="wikilink">periapsis</a> (or, as the central body in our Solar System is the sun, <a class="uri" href="perihelion" title="wikilink">perihelion</a>), is fixed. A number of effects in our solar system cause the perihelia of planets to precess (rotate) around the sun. The principal cause is the presence of other planets which <a href="Perturbation_(astronomy)" title="wikilink">perturb</a> each other's orbit. Another (much less significant) effect is solar <a href="oblate_spheroid" title="wikilink">oblateness</a>.</p>

<p>Mercury deviates from the precession predicted from these Newtonian effects. This anomalous rate of precession of the perihelion of Mercury's orbit was first recognized in 1859 as a problem in <a href="celestial_mechanics" title="wikilink">celestial mechanics</a>, by <a href="Urbain_Le_Verrier" title="wikilink">Urbain Le Verrier</a>. His re-analysis of available timed observations of transits of <a href="Mercury_(planet)" title="wikilink">Mercury</a> over the Sun's disk from 1697 to 1848 showed that the actual rate of the precession disagreed from that predicted from Newton's theory by 38" (arc seconds) per tropical century (later re-estimated at 43").<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> A number of <em>ad hoc</em> and ultimately unsuccessful solutions were proposed, but they tended to introduce more problems. In general relativity, this remaining <a href="Stellar_precession" title="wikilink">precession</a>, or change of orientation of the orbital ellipse within its orbital plane, is explained by gravitation being mediated by the curvature of spacetime. Einstein showed that general relativity<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> agrees closely with the observed amount of perihelion shift. This was a powerful factor motivating the adoption of general relativity.</p>

<p>Although earlier measurements of planetary orbits were made using conventional telescopes, more accurate measurements are now made with <a href="Radar_astronomy" title="wikilink">radar</a>. The total observed precession of Mercury is 574.10±0.65 <a href="arc-second" title="wikilink">arc-seconds</a> per century<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> relative to the inertial <a href="International_Celestial_Reference_Frame" title="wikilink">ICFR</a>. This precession can be attributed to the following causes:</p>

<p>Thus the effect can be fully explained by general relativity. More recent calculations based on more precise measurements have not materially changed the situation.</p>

<p>The other planets experience perihelion shifts as well, but, since they are farther from the sun and have longer periods, their shifts are lower, and could not be observed accurately until long after Mercury's. For example, the perihelion shift of Earth's orbit due to general relativity is of 3.84 seconds of arc per century, and Venus's is 8.62". Both values are in good agreement with observation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The <a class="uri" href="periapsis" title="wikilink">periapsis</a> shift of binary pulsar systems have been measured, with <a href="PSR_1913+16" title="wikilink">PSR 1913+16</a> amounting to 4.2º per year.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> These observations are consistent with general relativity.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> It is also possible to measure periapsis shift in binary star systems which do not contain ultra-dense stars, but it is more difficult to model the classical effects precisely - for example, the alignment of the stars' spin to their orbital plane needs to be known and is hard to measure directly - so a few systems such as <a href="DI_Herculis" title="wikilink">DI Herculis</a> have been considered as problematic cases for general relativity.</p>
<h3 id="deflection-of-light-by-the-sun">Deflection of light by the Sun</h3>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="Henry_Cavendish" title="wikilink">Henry Cavendish</a> in 1784 (in an unpublished manuscript) and <a href="Johann_Georg_von_Soldner" title="wikilink">Johann Georg von Soldner</a> in 1801 (published in 1804) had pointed out that Newtonian gravity predicts that starlight will bend around a massive object.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The same value as Soldner's was calculated by Einstein in 1911 based on the equivalence principle alone. However, Einstein noted in 1915 in the process of completing general relativity, that his (and thus Soldner's) 1911-result is only half of the correct value. Einstein became the first to calculate the correct value for light bending.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>The first observation of light deflection was performed by noting the change in position of <a href="star" title="wikilink">stars</a> as they passed near the Sun on the <a href="celestial_sphere" title="wikilink">celestial sphere</a>. The observations were performed in May 1919 by <a href="Sir_Arthur_Eddington" title="wikilink">Arthur Eddington</a> and his collaborators during a total <a href="solar_eclipse" title="wikilink">solar eclipse</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> so that the stars near the Sun could be observed. Observations were made simultaneously in the cities of <a href="Sobral,_Ceará" title="wikilink">Sobral, Ceará</a>, Brazil and in <a href="São_Tomé_and_Príncipe" title="wikilink">São Tomé and Príncipe</a> on the west coast of Africa.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The result was considered spectacular news and made the front page of most major newspapers. It made Einstein and his theory of general relativity world-famous. When asked by his assistant what his reaction would have been if general relativity had not been confirmed by Eddington and Dyson in 1919, Einstein famously made the quip: "Then I would feel sorry for the dear Lord. The theory is correct anyway." <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>The early accuracy, however, was poor. The results were argued by some<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> to have been plagued by <a href="systematic_error" title="wikilink">systematic error</a> and possibly <a href="confirmation_bias" title="wikilink">confirmation bias</a>, although modern reanalysis of the dataset<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> suggests that Eddington's analysis was accurate.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The measurement was repeated by a team from the <a href="Lick_Observatory" title="wikilink">Lick Observatory</a> in the 1922 eclipse, with results that agreed with the 1919 results<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> and has been repeated several times since, most notably in 1953 by <a href="Yerkes_Observatory" title="wikilink">Yerkes Observatory</a> astronomers<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> and in 1973 by a team from the <a href="University_of_Texas" title="wikilink">University of Texas</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Considerable uncertainty remained in these measurements for almost fifty years, until observations started being made at <a href="radio_astronomy" title="wikilink">radio frequencies</a>. It was not until the 1960s that it was definitively accepted that the amount of deflection was the full value predicted by general relativity, and not half that number. The <a href="Einstein_ring" title="wikilink">Einstein ring</a> is an example of the deflection of light from distant galaxies by more nearby objects.</p>
<h3 id="gravitational-redshift-of-light">Gravitational redshift of light</h3>

<p> Einstein predicted the <a href="gravitational_redshift" title="wikilink">gravitational redshift</a> of light from the <a href="equivalence_principle" title="wikilink">equivalence principle</a> in 1907, but it is very difficult to measure astrophysically (see the discussion under <em>Equivalence Principle</em> below). Although it was measured by <a href="Walter_Sydney_Adams" title="wikilink">Walter Sydney Adams</a> in 1925, it was only conclusively tested when the <a href="Pound–Rebka_experiment" title="wikilink">Pound–Rebka experiment</a> in 1959 measured the relative redshift of two sources situated at the top and bottom of Harvard University's Jefferson tower using an extremely sensitive phenomenon called the <a href="Mössbauer_effect" title="wikilink">Mössbauer effect</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The result was in excellent agreement with general relativity. This was one of the first precision experiments testing general relativity.</p>
<h2 id="modern-tests">Modern tests</h2>

<p>The modern era of testing general relativity was ushered in largely at the impetus of <a href="Robert_H._Dicke" title="wikilink">Dicke</a> and <a href="Leonard_Isaac_Schiff" title="wikilink">Schiff</a> who laid out a framework for testing general relativity.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> They emphasized the importance not only of the classical tests, but of null experiments, testing for effects which in principle could occur in a theory of gravitation, but do not occur in general relativity. Other important theoretical developments included the inception of <a href="alternatives_to_general_relativity" title="wikilink">alternative theories to general relativity</a>, in particular, <a href="scalar-tensor_theory" title="wikilink">scalar-tensor theories</a> such as the <a href="Brans–Dicke_theory" title="wikilink">Brans–Dicke theory</a>;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> the <a href="parameterized_post-Newtonian_formalism" title="wikilink">parameterized post-Newtonian formalism</a> in which deviations from general relativity can be quantified; and the framework of the <a href="equivalence_principle" title="wikilink">equivalence principle</a>.</p>

<p>Experimentally, new developments in <a href="space_exploration" title="wikilink">space exploration</a>, <a class="uri" href="electronics" title="wikilink">electronics</a> and <a href="condensed_matter_physics" title="wikilink">condensed matter physics</a> have made additional precise experiments possible, such as the Pound–Rebka experiment, laser interferometry and lunar rangefinding.</p>
<h3 id="post-newtonian-tests-of-gravity">Post-Newtonian tests of gravity</h3>

<p>Early tests of general relativity were hampered by the lack of viable competitors to the theory: it was not clear what sorts of tests would distinguish it from its competitors. General relativity was the only known relativistic theory of gravity compatible with special relativity and observations. Moreover, it is an extremely simple and elegant theory. This changed with the introduction of <a href="Brans–Dicke_theory" title="wikilink">Brans–Dicke theory</a> in 1960. This theory is arguably simpler, as it contains no <a href="dimensionless_number" title="wikilink">dimensionful</a> constants, and is compatible with a version of <a href="Mach's_principle" title="wikilink">Mach's principle</a> and <a href="Paul_Dirac" title="wikilink">Dirac's</a> <a href="Dirac_large_numbers_hypothesis" title="wikilink">large numbers hypothesis</a>, two philosophical ideas which have been influential in the history of relativity. Ultimately, this led to the development of the <a href="PPN_formalism" title="wikilink">parametrized post-Newtonian formalism</a> by <a href="Kenneth_Nordtvedt" title="wikilink">Nordtvedt</a> and <a href="Clifford_Martin_Will" title="wikilink">Will</a>, which parametrizes, in terms of ten adjustable parameters, all the possible departures from Newton's law of universal gravitation to first order in the velocity of moving objects (<em>i.e.</em> to first order in

, where <em>v</em> is the velocity of an object and <em>c</em> is the speed of light). This approximation allows the possible deviations from general relativity, for slowly moving objects in weak gravitational fields, to be systematically analyzed. Much effort has been put into constraining the post-Newtonian parameters, and deviations from general relativity are at present severely limited.</p>

<p>The experiments testing gravitational lensing and light time delay limits the same post-Newtonian parameter, the so-called Eddington parameter γ, which is a straightforward parametrization of the amount of deflection of light by a gravitational source. It is equal to one for general relativity, and takes different values in other theories (such as Brans–Dicke theory). It is the best constrained of the ten post-Newtonian parameters, but there are other experiments designed to constrain the others. Precise observations of the perihelion shift of Mercury constrain other parameters, as do tests of the strong equivalence principle.</p>

<p>One of the goals of the mission <a class="uri" href="BepiColombo" title="wikilink">BepiColombo</a> is testing the general relativity theory by measuring the parameters gamma and beta of the parametrized post-Newtonian formalism with high accuracy.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="gravitational-lensing">Gravitational lensing</h3>

<p>One of the most important tests is <a href="gravitational_lensing" title="wikilink">gravitational lensing</a>. It has been observed in distant astrophysical sources, but these are poorly controlled and it is uncertain how they constrain general relativity. The most precise tests are analogous to Eddington's 1919 experiment: they measure the deflection of radiation from a distant source by the sun. The sources that can be most precisely analyzed are distant <a href="radio_astronomy" title="wikilink">radio sources</a>. In particular, some <a href="quasar" title="wikilink">quasars</a> are very strong radio sources. The directional resolution of any telescope is in principle limited by diffraction; for radio telescopes this is also the practical limit. An important improvement in obtaining positional high accuracies (from milli-arcsecond to micro-arcsecond) was obtained by combining radio telescopes across the Earth. The technique is called <a href="VLBI" title="wikilink">very long baseline interferometry</a> (VLBI). With this technique radio observations couple the phase information of the radio signal observed in telescopes separated over large distances. Recently, these telescopes have measured the deflection of radio waves by the Sun to extremely high precision, confirming the amount of deflection predicted by general relativity aspect to the 0.03% level.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> At this level of precision systematic effects have to be carefully taken into account to determine the precise location of the telescopes on Earth. Some important effects are the Earth's <a class="uri" href="nutation" title="wikilink">nutation</a>, rotation, atmospheric refraction, tectonic displacement and tidal waves. Another important effect is refraction of the radio waves by the <a href="solar_corona" title="wikilink">solar corona</a>. Fortunately, this effect has a characteristic <a class="uri" href="spectrum" title="wikilink">spectrum</a>, whereas gravitational distortion is independent of wavelength. Thus, careful analysis, using measurements at several frequencies, can subtract this source of error.</p>

<p>The entire sky is slightly distorted due to the gravitational deflection of light caused by the Sun (the anti-Sun direction excepted). This effect has been observed by the <a href="European_Space_Agency" title="wikilink">European Space Agency</a> astrometric satellite <a class="uri" href="Hipparcos" title="wikilink">Hipparcos</a>. It measured the positions of about 10<sup>5</sup> stars. During the full mission about  relative positions have been determined, each to an accuracy of typically 3 milliarcseconds (the accuracy for an 8–9 magnitude star). Since the gravitation deflection perpendicular to the Earth-Sun direction is already 4.07 milliarcseconds, corrections are needed for practically all stars. Without systematic effects, the error in an individual observation of 3 milliarcseconds, could be reduced by the square root of the number of positions, leading to a precision of 0.0016 milliarcseconds. Systematic effects, however, limit the accuracy of the determination to 0.3% (Froeschlé, 1997).</p>

<p>In future, <a href="Gaia_(spacecraft)" title="wikilink">Gaia spacecraft</a> will conduct a census of one billion <a href="star" title="wikilink">stars</a> in <a href="Milky_Way" title="wikilink">our Galaxy</a> and measure their positions to an accuracy of 24 microarcseconds. Thus it will also provide stringent new tests of gravitational deflection of light caused by the <a class="uri" href="Sun" title="wikilink">Sun</a> which was predicted by General relativity.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="light-travel-time-delay-testing">Light travel time delay testing</h3>

<p><a href="Irwin_I._Shapiro" title="wikilink">Irwin I. Shapiro</a> proposed another test, beyond the classical tests, which could be performed within the solar system. It is sometimes called the fourth "classical" test of <a href="general_relativity" title="wikilink">general relativity</a>. He predicted a relativistic time delay (<a href="Shapiro_delay" title="wikilink">Shapiro delay</a>) in the round-trip travel time for radar signals reflecting off other planets.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The mere curvature of the path of a <a class="uri" href="photon" title="wikilink">photon</a> passing near the Sun is too small to have an observable delaying effect (when the round-trip time is compared to the time taken if the photon had followed a straight path), but general relativity predicts a time delay which becomes progressively larger when the photon passes nearer to the Sun due to the <a href="time_dilation" title="wikilink">time dilation</a> in the <a href="gravitational_potential" title="wikilink">gravitational potential</a> of the sun.

<h3 id="the-equivalence-principle">The equivalence principle</h3>

<p>The equivalence principle, in its simplest form, asserts that the trajectories of falling bodies in a gravitational field should be independent of their mass and internal structure, provided they are small enough not to disturb the environment or be affected by <a href="tidal_forces" title="wikilink">tidal forces</a>. This idea has been tested to incredible precision by <a href="Eötvös_experiment" title="wikilink">Eötvös torsion balance experiments</a>, which look for a differential acceleration between two test masses. Constraints on this, and on the existence of a composition-dependent fifth force or gravitational <a href="Yukawa_interaction" title="wikilink">Yukawa interaction</a> are very strong, and are discussed under <a href="fifth_force" title="wikilink">fifth force</a> and <a href="weak_equivalence_principle" title="wikilink">weak equivalence principle</a>.</p>

<p>A version of the equivalence principle, called the <a href="strong_equivalence_principle" title="wikilink">strong equivalence principle</a>, asserts that self-gravitation falling bodies, such as stars, planets or black holes (which are all held together by their gravitational attraction) should follow the same trajectories in a gravitational field, provided the same conditions are satisfied. This is called the <a href="Nordtvedt_effect" title="wikilink">Nordtvedt effect</a> and is most precisely tested by the <a href="Lunar_Laser_Ranging_Experiment" title="wikilink">Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Since 1969, it has continuously measured the distance from several rangefinding stations on Earth to reflectors on the Moon to approximately centimeter accuracy.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> These have provided a strong constraint on several of the other post-Newtonian parameters.</p>

<p>Another part of the strong equivalence principle is the requirement that Newton's gravitational constant be constant in time, and have the same value everywhere in the universe. There are many independent observations limiting the possible variation of Newton's <a href="gravitational_constant" title="wikilink">gravitational constant</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> but one of the best comes from lunar rangefinding which suggests that the gravitational constant does not change by more than one part in 10<sup>11</sup> per year. The constancy of the other constants is discussed in the <a href="Einstein_equivalence_principle" title="wikilink">Einstein equivalence principle</a> section of the equivalence principle article.</p>
<h4 id="gravitational-redshift">Gravitational redshift</h4>

<p>The first of the classical tests discussed above, the <a href="gravitational_redshift" title="wikilink">gravitational redshift</a>, is a simple consequence of the <a href="Einstein_equivalence_principle" title="wikilink">Einstein equivalence principle</a> and was predicted by Einstein in 1907. As such, it is not a test of general relativity in the same way as the post-Newtonian tests, because any theory of gravity obeying the equivalence principle should also incorporate the gravitational redshift. Nonetheless, confirming the existence of the effect was an important substantiation of relativistic gravity, since the absence of gravitational redshift would have strongly contradicted relativity. The first observation of the gravitational redshift was the measurement of the shift in the spectral lines from the <a href="white_dwarf" title="wikilink">white dwarf</a> star <a class="uri" href="Sirius" title="wikilink">Sirius</a> B by Adams in 1925. Although this measurement, as well as later measurements of the spectral shift on other white dwarf stars, agreed with the prediction of relativity, it could be argued that the shift could possibly stem from some other cause, and hence experimental verification using a known terrestrial source was preferable.</p>

<p>Experimental verification of gravitational redshift using terrestrial sources took several decades, because it is difficult to find clocks (to measure <a href="time_dilation" title="wikilink">time dilation</a>) or sources of electromagnetic radiation (to measure redshift) with a frequency that is known well enough that the effect can be accurately measured. It was confirmed experimentally for the first time in 1960 using measurements of the change in wavelength of gamma-ray photons generated with the <a href="Mössbauer_effect" title="wikilink">Mössbauer effect</a>, which generates radiation with a very narrow line width. The experiment, performed by Pound and Rebka and later improved by Pound and Snyder, is called the <a href="Pound–Rebka_experiment" title="wikilink">Pound–Rebka experiment</a>. The accuracy of the gamma-ray measurements was typically 1%. The blueshift of a falling photon can be found by assuming it has an equivalent mass based on its frequency

, a result of special relativity. Such simple derivations ignore the fact that in general relativity the experiment compares clock rates, rather than energies. In other words, the "higher energy" of the photon after it falls can be equivalently ascribed to the slower running of clocks deeper in the gravitational potential well. To fully validate general relativity, it is important to also show that the rate of arrival of the photons is greater than the rate at which they are emitted. A very accurate gravitational redshift experiment, which deals with this issue, was performed in 1976,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> where a <a class="uri" href="hydrogen" title="wikilink">hydrogen</a> <a class="uri" href="maser" title="wikilink">maser</a> clock on a rocket was launched to a height of 10,000 km, and its rate compared with an identical clock on the ground. It tested the gravitational redshift to 0.007%.</p>

<p>Although the <a href="Global_Positioning_System" title="wikilink">Global Positioning System</a> (GPS) is not designed as a test of fundamental physics, it must account for the gravitational redshift in its timing system, and physicists have analyzed timing data from the GPS to confirm other tests. When the first satellite was launched, some engineers resisted the prediction that a noticeable gravitational time dilation would occur, so the first satellite was launched without the clock adjustment that was later built into subsequent satellites. It showed the predicted shift of 38 microseconds per day. This rate of discrepancy is sufficient to substantially impair function of GPS within hours if not accounted for. An excellent account of the role played by general relativity in the design of GPS can be found in Ashby 2003.</p>

<p><a class="uri" href="Pulsars" title="wikilink">Pulsars</a> are rapidly rotating <a href="neutron_star" title="wikilink">neutron stars</a> which emit regular radio pulses as they rotate. As such they act as clocks which allow very precise monitoring of their orbital motions. Observations of pulsars in orbit around other stars have all demonstrated substantial <a class="uri" href="periapsis" title="wikilink">periapsis</a> precessions that cannot be accounted for classically but can be accounted for by using general relativity. For example, the Hulse–Taylor <a href="binary_pulsar" title="wikilink">binary pulsar</a> <a href="PSR_B1913+16" title="wikilink">PSR B1913+16</a> (a pair of neutron stars in which one is detected as a pulsar) has an observed precession of over 4° of arc per year (periastron shift per orbit only about 10<sup>−6</sup>). This precession has been used to compute the masses of the components.</p>

<p>Similarly to the way in which atoms and molecules emit electromagnetic radiation, a gravitating mass that is in <a class="uri" href="quadrupole" title="wikilink">quadrupole</a> type or higher order vibration, or is asymmetric and in rotation, can emit gravitational waves.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> These <a href="gravitational_waves" title="wikilink">gravitational waves</a> are predicted to travel at the <a href="speed_of_light" title="wikilink">speed of light</a>. For example, planets orbiting the Sun constantly lose energy via gravitational radiation, but this effect is so small that it is unlikely it will be observed in the near future (Earth radiates about 200 watts (see <a href="gravitational_waves" title="wikilink">gravitational waves</a>) of gravitational radiation).</p>

<p>Gravitational waves have been indirectly detected from the <a href="PSR_B1913+16" title="wikilink">Hulse–Taylor binary</a> (and other binary pulsars).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Precise timing of the pulses shows that the stars orbit only approximately according to <a href="Kepler's_Laws" title="wikilink">Kepler's Laws</a>: over time they gradually spiral towards each other, demonstrating an <a class="uri" href="energy" title="wikilink">energy</a> loss in close agreement with the predicted energy radiated by gravitational waves.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Thus, although the waves have not been directly measured, their effect is necessary to explain these orbits. For their discovery of the first binary pulsar and measuring its orbital decay due to gravitational-wave emission, <a href="Russell_Alan_Hulse" title="wikilink">Hulse</a> and <a href="Joseph_Hooton_Taylor,_Jr." title="wikilink">Taylor</a> won the 1993 <a href="Nobel_Prize_in_Physics" title="wikilink">Nobel Prize in Physics</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>

<p>A "double pulsar" discovered in 2003, <a href="PSR_J0737-3039" title="wikilink">PSR J0737-3039</a>, has a periastron precession of 16.90° per year; unlike the Hulse–Taylor binary, both <a href="neutron_star" title="wikilink">neutron stars</a> are detected as pulsars, allowing precision timing of both members of the system. Due to this, the tight orbit, the fact that the system is almost edge-on, and the very low transverse velocity of the system as seen from Earth, J0737−3039 provides by far the best system for strong-field tests of general relativity known so far. Several distinct relativistic effects are observed, including orbital decay as in the Hulse–Taylor system. After observing the system for two and a half years, four independent tests of general relativity were possible, the most precise (the Shapiro delay) confirming the general relativity prediction within 0.05%<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> (nevertheless the periastron shift per orbit is only about 0.0013% of a circle and thus it is not a higher-order relativity test).</p>

<p>In 2013, an international team of astronomers report new data from observing a pulsar-white dwarf system <a href="PSR_J0348+0432" title="wikilink">PSR J0348+0432</a>, in which they have been able to measure a change in the orbital period 8 millionths of a second per year, and confirmed GR predictions in a regime of extreme gravitational fields never probed before;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> but there are still some competing theories that would agree with these data.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="direct-detection-of-gravitational-waves">Direct detection of gravitational waves</h2>

<p>As described above, <a href="#Strong_field_tests:_Binary_pulsars" title="wikilink">binary pulsar</a> observations have shown conclusively, although indirectly, that <a href="gravitational_wave" title="wikilink">gravitational waves</a> exist. A number of <a href="gravitational-wave_detector" title="wikilink">gravitational-wave detectors</a> have been built with the intent of directly detecting the gravitational waves emanating from such astronomical events as the merger of two <a href="neutron_star" title="wikilink">neutron stars</a> or <a href="black_hole" title="wikilink">black holes</a>. Currently, the most sensitive of these is the <a href="LIGO" title="wikilink">Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO)</a>, which was in operation from 2002 to 2010. To date, there has not been a single detection event by any of the existing detectors. Future detectors are being developed or planned, which will greatly improve the sensitivity of these experiments, such as the Advanced LIGO detector due to start operation in 2015, and the proposed <a href="Laser_Interferometer_Space_Antenna" title="wikilink">evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (eLISA)</a>. It is anticipated, for example, that Advanced LIGO will detect events possibly as often as daily, but there is great uncertainty in this (possibly a factor of 1000).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn74" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>

<p>General relativity predicts gravitational waves, as does any theory of gravitation that obeys <a href="special_relativity" title="wikilink">special relativity</a> and so has changes in the gravitational field propagate at a finite speed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn75" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Continued failure to find waves as the detectors become more sensitive would tend to falsify both special and general relativity. However, because of the uncertainty in astrophysical event rates, a lack of detection is more likely to be initially attributed to a previous over-estimation of how many detectable gravitational-wave signals there should be — for example, it would not be surprising if Advanced LIGO operates for three years and detects nothing if detectable signals only occur on average once every ten years — and so update our understanding of <a href="star_formation" title="wikilink">star formation</a>, <a href="stellar_evolution" title="wikilink">stellar evolution</a> or <a href="Galaxy_formation_and_evolution" title="wikilink">galaxy evolution</a>. If, in the future, gravitational waves (of the predicted kind) were discovered, this would be evidence in favour of general relativity.</p>

<p>Once gravitational waves can be directly detected, it is possible to use them to learn about the Universe. This is <a href="gravitational-wave_astronomy" title="wikilink">gravitational-wave astronomy</a>. Gravitational-wave astronomy can test general relativity by verifying that the observed waves are of the form predicted (for example, that they only have two transverse polarizations), and by checking that <a href="black_hole" title="wikilink">black holes</a> are the objects described by solutions of the <a href="Einstein_field_equations" title="wikilink">Einstein field equations</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn76" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn77" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="cosmological-tests">Cosmological tests</h2>

<p>Tests of general relativity on the largest scales are not nearly so stringent as solar system tests.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn78" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> The earliest such test was prediction and discovery of the <a href="expansion_of_the_universe" title="wikilink">expansion of the universe</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn79" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> In 1922 <a href="Alexander_Friedmann" title="wikilink">Alexander Friedmann</a> found that Einstein equations have non-stationary solutions (even in the presence of the <a href="cosmological_constant" title="wikilink">cosmological constant</a>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn80" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn81" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> In 1927 <a href="Georges_Lemaître" title="wikilink">Georges Lemaître</a> showed that static solutions of the Einstein equations, which are possible in the presence of the cosmological constant, are unstable, and therefore the static universe envisioned by Einstein could not exist (it must either expand or contract).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn82" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Lemaître made an explicit prediction that the universe should expand.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn83" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> He also derived a redshift-distance relationship, which is now known as the <a href="Hubble_Law" title="wikilink">Hubble Law</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn84" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Later, in 1931, Einstein himself agreed with the results of Friedmann and Lemaître.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn85" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> The expansion of the universe discovered by <a href="Edwin_Hubble" title="wikilink">Edwin Hubble</a> in 1929<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn86" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> was then considered by many (and continues to be considered by some now) as a direct confirmation of general relativity.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn87" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> In the 1930s, largely due to the work of <a href="E._A._Milne" title="wikilink">E.

<p>Some other cosmological tests include searches for primordial gravitational waves generated during <a href="cosmic_inflation" title="wikilink">cosmic inflation</a>, which may be detected in the <a href="cosmic_microwave_background" title="wikilink">cosmic microwave background</a> <a href="Polarization_(waves)" title="wikilink">polarization</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn90" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> or by a proposed space-based <a href="gravitational-wave_detector" title="wikilink">gravitational-wave interferometer</a> called the <a href="Big_Bang_Observer" title="wikilink">Big Bang Observer</a>.

<li id="fn66">In general relativity, a perfectly spherical star (in vacuum) that expands or contracts while remaining perfectly spherical <em>cannot</em> emit any gravitational waves (similar to the lack of e/m radiation from a pulsating charge), as <a href="Birkhoff's_theorem_(relativity)" title="wikilink">Birkhoff's theorem</a> says that the geometry remains the same exterior to the star. More generally, a rotating system will only emit gravitational waves if it lacks the axial symmetry with respect to the axis of rotation.<a href="#fnref66">↩</a></li>
