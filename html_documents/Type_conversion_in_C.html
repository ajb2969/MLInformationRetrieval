<h1>Type conversion in C</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In the <a href="C_(programming_language)" title="wikilink">C programming language</a>, a <strong>type conversion</strong> is the conversion two different sorts of <a href="data_type" title="wikilink">data type</a> into a common form, in order for them to be manipulated. The two most commonly used conversion types in the C programming language are:</p>

<p>1.Implict</p>

<p>2.Explict</p>

<p>In the C language there are different basic data types, such as int, char, float, double; there are also some user defined data types such as <a href="Data_structure" title="wikilink">structures</a>, arrays, etc. If the <a href="operator_(programming)" title="wikilink">operator</a> is taking operands of different data types, then they are converted to a common data types by certain rules. Generally, automatic conversions are those which can convert a <em>narrower</em> operand into a <em>wider</em> one without loss of information. For example, converting an integer to floating point in examples like <em>float</em> + <em>integer</em> (on <a class="uri" href="64-bit" title="wikilink">64-bit</a> machine). A <em>char</em> is simply a small integer, so chars may be freely used in arithmetic expressions.</p>

<p>Conversion of char to integer, every character in c corresponds to a particular ASCII value. Anytime two character are values are operated using arithmetic operator their ASCII values(specific numerical value) are picked and evaluated. But when a char is converted to int can it ever produce negative value? The answer varies from machine to machine, reflecting difference in architecture. On some machines a char whose leftmost bit is 1 will be converted to a negative integer("sign extension"). On others, a char is promoted to int by adding zeroes at the left most end, and thus always positive. The definition of C guarantees that any character in the machine's standard printing character set will never be negative, so these characters will always be positive quantities in expressions.</p>

<p>Relational operators like i&gt;j and logical expressions connected by &amp;&amp; and || are defined to have values 1 if true, and 0 if false. Thus the assignment</p>

<p>d= c&gt;= '0' &amp;&amp; c will use the double precision. The main reason for using float is to save storage in large arrays, or, less often, to save time on the machines where double- precision arithmetic is particularly expensive.</p>

<p>Conversion rules are more complicated when unsigned operators are involved. The problem is that comparisons between signed and unsigned values are machine-dependent, because they depend on the size of the various integer types. For example, suppose that int is 16 bits and long is 32 bis. Then -1L  1UL, because -1L is promoted to unsigned long and thus appears to be large positive number.</p>

<p>Conversion in assignment operator, the value on right side is converted to value of the left hand side. A character is converted to int. Or Longer integer is converted to char(smaller) by dropping higher-order bits. Thus in</p>

<p><code>         int i;</code><br/>
<code>         char c;</code></p>

<p><code>         i=c; </code><br/>
<code>         c=i;</code></p>

<p>the value of c is unchanged.</p>

<p>Explicitly, forced conversion can be done also be sone (type-name) expression</p>

<p><code>         int i;</code></p>

<p><code>         (long) i</code></p>
<h2 id="conversion-to-bool">Conversion to Bool</h2>

<p>When converted to Bool anything that is not 0 or NULL is true. (while all known implementations use 0 for NULL this is not required by the standard)</p>
