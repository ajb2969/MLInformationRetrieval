<h1>PPA (complexity)</h1>
<hr>'''PPA''' is a [[complexi
<p>ty class]], standing for "Polynomial Parity Argument" (on a graph). Introduced by <a href="Christos_Papadimitriou" title="wikilink">Christos Papadimitriou</a> in 1994<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (page 528), PPA is a subclass of <a class="uri" href="TFNP" title="wikilink">TFNP</a>. It is a class of search problems that can be shown to be total by an application of the <a href="handshaking_lemma" title="wikilink">handshaking lemma</a>: <em>any undirected graph that has a vertex whose degree is an odd number must have some other vertex whose degree is an odd number</em>. This observation means that if we are given a graph and an odd-degree vertex, and we are asked to find some other odd-degree vertex, then we are searching for something that is guaranteed to exist (so, we have a total search problem).</p>

<p>PPA is defined as follows. Suppose we have a graph on whose vertices are

-bit binary strings, and the graph is represented by a polynomial-sized circuit that takes a vertex as input and outputs its neighbors. (Note that this allows us to represent an exponentially-large graph on which we can efficiently perform local exploration.) Suppose furthermore that a specific vertex (say the all-zeroes vector) has an odd number of neighbors. We are required to find another odd-degree vertex. Note that this problem is in NP—given a solution it may be verified using the circuit that the solution is correct. A function computation problem belongs to PPA if it admits a <a href="polynomial-time_reduction" title="wikilink">polynomial-time reduction</a> to this graph search problem. A problem is <a href="Complete_(complexity)" title="wikilink">complete</a> for the class PPA if in addition, this graph search problem is reducible to that problem.</p>

<p>PPA contains <a class="uri" href="PPAD" title="wikilink">PPAD</a> as a subclass. This is because the corresponding problem that defines PPAD, known as END OF THE LINE, can be reduced (in a straightforward way) to the above search for an additional odd-degree vertex (essentially, just by ignoring the directions of the edges in END OF THE LINE).</p>

<p>There is an un-oriented version of the Sperner lemma known to be complete for PPA.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The problem of searching for a second <a href="Hamiltonian_cycle" title="wikilink">Hamiltonian cycle</a> on a 3-regular graph is a member of PPA, but is not known to be complete for PPA.</p>
