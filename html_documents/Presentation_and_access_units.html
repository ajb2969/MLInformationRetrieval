<h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>

<p>A presentation unit is the elementary block that contains each one of the <a href="digital_information" title="wikilink">digital information</a>, still without <a href="Data_compression" title="wikilink">compressing</a>, of video, audio or data in "<a href="system_layer" title="wikilink">system layer</a>". In this layer the operations are realised in order to lead to obtain signal flows <a class="uri" href="MPEG-2" title="wikilink">MPEG-2</a>, which they consist of the organization in packages, of the compressed data and the later one muxed <a href="multiplexing" title="wikilink">multiplex</a> of all signals associated to the program.</p>

<p>As far as the audio one, the “presentation unit” is a “Scheme of Audio <a class="uri" href="AES3" title="wikilink">AES3</a>/ EBU”. In this case, they are required from 16 to 24 bits by sample to provide the dynamic range and wished signal/noise link.</p>

<h2 id="access-unit">Access unit</h2>
<h3 id="definition-1">Definition</h3>

<p>An access unit is a logical substructure of "elementary stream" formed by binary audio video flows and compressed to facilitate the bit stream manipulation access. It is the smallest data organization than it is possible to be attributed to the systems of synchronization of layer of <a href="Data_compression" title="wikilink">compression</a>. In this layer, MPEG decoding operations are made, taking care about general procedures of data compression, and being useful in addition, for the images, his space <a href="Data_redundancy" title="wikilink">redundancy</a> (same areas) and temporally (successive images), correlation between near points and the smaller sensitivity of the eye to fix details of the fixed images.</p>

<p>Already, "Packers P.E.S." are found in System Layers that it constitutes the following step in the generation of program multiplex and transport <a href="Multiplexing" title="wikilink">multiplex</a> MPEG-2. One is to turn each “Elementary Stream (E.S.)” composed exclusively by “Units Access”, in a “Packetised Elementary Stream (P.E.S.)”. A P.E.S is completely compound of “PES-Packets”, as it is in the figure:</p>

<p>In the case of the video signal, the compressed “access units”, since we have verified, are 3 types, corresponding to other so many types of images MPEG:</p>
<ul>
<li>Images type I (Intra): They are codified without reference to other images, that is to say: they contain all the necessary elements for its reconstruction.</li>
<li>Images P type (Anticipated): They are codified with respect to the image of type I or another previous P, thanks to the techniques of prediction with compensation of movement. Its compression rate is clearly greater than the one of images I.</li>
<li>Images B type (Bidirectional): They are codified by interpolation between two images of I type or preceding and following P frames that them. They offer a higher rate compression.</li>
</ul>

<p>The video sequence MPEP codification result is a succession of “Video AccessUnits”. This succession of access units constitutes the denominated “Video Elementary Stream (Video E.S.)”.</p>

<p>In the case of the audio signal, the “Access Units” typically contains a few audio milliseconds audio tablet. In the same way, the result of codification MPEG for the audio one is a succession of “Audio Access Units” that compose the denominated “Audio Elementary Stream (Audio E.S.)”.</p>
