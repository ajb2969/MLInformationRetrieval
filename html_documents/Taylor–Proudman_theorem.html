<h1>Taylor–Proudman theorem</h1>
<hr>In [[fluid mechanics]], the '''Taylor–Proudman theorem'''<ref>The Taylor-Proudman theorem was first derived by Sydney Samuel Hough (1870-1923), a mathematician at Cambridge University.  See:  {{cite journal |author=Hough, S.S. |title=On the application of harmonic analysis to the dynamical theory of the tides. Part I. On Laplace’s "oscillations of the first species," and on the dynamics of ocean currents |journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A |volume=189 |pages=201–257 |date=January 1<p>, 1897 |doi=10.1098/rsta.1897.0009 |bibcode = 1897RSPTA.189..201H }} (after <a href="G._I._Taylor" title="wikilink">G. I. Taylor</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and <a href="Joseph_Proudman" title="wikilink">Joseph Proudman</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>) states that when a solid body is moved slowly within a fluid that is steadily rotated with a high <a href="angular_velocity" title="wikilink">angular velocity</a> <span class="LaTeX">$\Omega$</span>, the fluid <a class="uri" href="velocity" title="wikilink">velocity</a> will be uniform along any line parallel to the axis of rotation. <span class="LaTeX">$\Omega$</span> must be large compared to the movement of the solid body in order to make the <a href="coriolis_force" title="wikilink">coriolis force</a> large compared to the acceleration terms.</p>
<p>That this is so may be seen by considering the <a href="Navier–Stokes_equations" title="wikilink">Navier–Stokes equations</a> for steady flow, with zero viscosity and a body force corresponding to the <a href="Coriolis_force" title="wikilink">Coriolis force</a>, which are:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\rho({\mathbf u}\cdot\nabla){\mathbf u}={\mathbf F}-\nabla p,$$</span> where <span class="LaTeX">${\mathbf u}$</span> is the fluid velocity, <span class="LaTeX">$\rho$</span> is the fluid density, and <span class="LaTeX">$p$</span> the pressure. If we now make the assumption that <span class="LaTeX">$F=\nabla\Phi$</span> is <a href="scalar_potential" title="wikilink">scalar potential</a> and the advective term may be neglected (reasonable if the <a href="Rossby_number" title="wikilink">Rossby number</a> is much less than unity) and that the flow is incompressible (density is constant) then the equations become:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$2\rho\mathbf\Omega\times{\mathbf u}=\nabla \Phi -\nabla p,$$</span> where <span class="LaTeX">$\Omega$</span> is the <a href="angular_velocity" title="wikilink">angular velocity</a> vector. If the <a href="Curl_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">curl</a> of this equation is taken, the result is the Taylor–Proudman theorem:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$({\mathbf\Omega}\cdot\nabla){\mathbf u}={\mathbf  0}.$$</span></p>
<p>To derive this, one needs the vector identities</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\nabla\times(A\times B)=A(\nabla\cdot B)-(A\cdot\nabla)B+(B\cdot\nabla)A-B(\nabla\cdot A)$$</span></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\nabla\times(\nabla p)=0\$$</span></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\nabla\times(\nabla \Phi)=0\$$</span></p>
<p>(because the <a href="Curl_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">curl</a> of the gradient is always equal to zero). Note that <span class="LaTeX">$\nabla\cdot{\mathbf\Omega}=0$</span> is also needed (angular velocity is divergence-free).</p>
<p>The vector form of the Taylor–Proudman theorem is perhaps better understood by expanding the dot product:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\Omega_x\frac{\partial {\mathbf u}}{\partial x} + \Omega_y\frac{\partial {\mathbf u}}{\partial y} + \Omega_z\frac{\partial {\mathbf u}}{\partial z}=0.$$</span></p>
<p>Now choose coordinates in which <span class="LaTeX">$\Omega_x=\Omega_y=0$</span> and then the equations reduce to</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\frac{\partial{\mathbf u}}{\partial z}=0,$$</span> if <span class="LaTeX">$\Omega_z\neq 0$</span>. Note that the implication is that <em>all three</em> components of the velocity vector are uniform along any line parallel to the z-axis.</p>
<h2 id="taylor-column">Taylor Column</h2>
<p>The Taylor column is an imaginary cylinder projected above and below a real cylinder that has been placed parallel to the rotation axis (anywhere in the flow, not necessarily in the center). The flow will curve around the imaginary cylinders just like the real due to the Taylor–Proudman theorem, which states that the flow in a rotating, homogeneous, inviscid fluid are 2-dimensional in the plane orthogonal to the rotation axis and thus there is no variation in the flow along the <span class="LaTeX">$\vec{\Omega}$</span>axis, often taken to be the <span class="LaTeX">$\hat{z}$</span> axis.</p>
<p>The Taylor column is a simplified, experimentally observed effect of what transpires in the Earth's atmospheres and oceans.</p>
