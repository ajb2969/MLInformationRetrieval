<h1>Diffusing capacity</h1>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Diffusing capacity</strong> of the lung (D<sub>L</sub>) measures the transfer of gas from air in the lung, to the <a href="red_blood_cell" title="wikilink">red blood cells</a> in lung blood vessels. It is part of a comprehensive series of tests (<a href="pulmonary_function_testing" title="wikilink">pulmonary function testing</a>) to determine the overall ability of the <a class="uri" href="lung" title="wikilink">lung</a> to transport gas into and out of the blood. D<sub>L</sub>, especially <a href="DLCO" title="wikilink">D<sub>LCO</sub></a>, is reduced in certain diseases of the lung and heart. D<sub>LCO</sub> measurement has been standardized according to a position paper<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> by a task force of the <a href="European_Respiratory_Society" title="wikilink">European Respiratory</a> and <a href="American_Thoracic_Society" title="wikilink">American Thoracic</a> Societies.</p>
<p>In <a href="respiratory_physiology" title="wikilink">respiratory physiology</a>, the diffusing capacity has a long history of great utility, representing <a href="Electrical_resistance_and_conductance" title="wikilink">conductance</a> of gas across the alveolar-capillary membrane and also takes into account factors affecting the behaviour of a given gas with hemoglobin.</p>
<p>The term may be considered a misnomer as it represents neither <a class="uri" href="diffusion" title="wikilink">diffusion</a> nor a <a href="Battery_(electricity)" title="wikilink">capacity</a> (as it is typically measured under submaximal conditions) nor <a class="uri" href="capacitance" title="wikilink">capacitance</a>. In addition, gas transport is only diffusion limited in extreme cases, such as for oxygen uptake at very low ambient oxygen or very high pulmonary blood flow.</p>
<p>The diffusing capacity does not directly measure the primary cause of <a class="uri" href="hypoxemia" title="wikilink">hypoxemia</a>, or low blood oxygen, namely mismatch of <a href="Ventilation/perfusion_ratio" title="wikilink">ventilation to perfusion</a>:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Not all pulmonary arterial blood goes to areas of the lung where gas exchange can occur (the anatomic or physiologic shunts), and this poorly oxygenated blood rejoins the well oxygenated blood from healthy lung in the pulmonary vein. Together, the mixture has less oxygen than that blood from the healthy lung alone, and so is hypoxemic.</li>
<li>Similarly, not all inspired air goes to areas of the lung where gas exchange can occur (the <a href="Dead_space_(physiology)" title="wikilink">anatomic and the physiological dead spaces</a>), and so is wasted.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="calculation">Calculation</h2>
<p>The diffusion capacity for oxygen <span class="LaTeX">$(D_{L_{O_2}})$</span> is the proportionality factor relating the rate of oxygen uptake into the lung to the oxygen gradient between the capillary blood and the alveoli (per <a href="Fick's_laws_of_diffusion" title="wikilink">Fick's laws of diffusion</a>). In <a href="respiratory_physiology" title="wikilink">respiratory physiology</a>, it is convenient to express the transport of gas molecules as changes in volume, since <span class="LaTeX">${V_{O_2}}\propto {n_{O_2}}$</span> (i.e., in a gas, a volume is proportional to the number of molecules in it). Further, the oxygen concentration (<a href="partial_pressure" title="wikilink">partial pressure</a>) in the pulmonary artery is taken to be representative of capillary blood. Thus, <span class="LaTeX">$(D_{L_{O_2}})$</span> can be calculated as the ratio of the volume of the oxygen taken up by the lung <span class="LaTeX">$(\dot{V}_{O_{2}})$</span> divided by the oxygen gradient between the alveoli ("A") and the pulmonary artery ("a").  =\frac {\dot{V}_{O_{2}}} {P_{A_{O_2}} - P_{a_{O_2}}} \simeq \frac {\dot{V}_{O_{2}}} {P_{A_{O_2}} - P_{v_{O_2}}} | <mtpl><eqref>1<eqref></eqref></eqref></mtpl> }}</p>
<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd>(For <span class="LaTeX">$\dot{V}$</span>, say "V dot". This is the notation of <a href="Isaac_Newton" title="wikilink">Isaac Newton</a> for a first derivative (or rate) and is commonly used in respiratory physiology for this purpose.)
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$\dot{V}_{O_{2}}$</span> is the rate that oxygen is taken up by the lung (ml/min).
</dd>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$P_{A_{O_2}}$</span> is the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli.
</dd>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$P_{a_{O_2}}$</span> is the partial pressure of oxygen in the pulmonary artery.
</dd>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$P_{v_{O_2}}$</span> is the partial pressure of oxygen in the systemic veins (where it can actually be measured).
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thus, the higher the diffusing capacity <span class="LaTeX">$D_L$</span>, the more gas will be transferred into the lung per unit time for a given gradient in partial pressure (or concentration) of the gas. Since it can be possible to know the alveolar oxygen concentration and the rate of oxygen uptake - but not the oxygen concentration in the pulmonary artery - it is the venous oxygen concentration that is generally employed as a useful approximation in a clinical setting.</p>
<p>Sampling the oxygen concentration in the pulmonary artery is a highly invasive procedure, but fortunately another similar gas can be used instead that obviates this need (<a class="uri" href="DLCO" title="wikilink">DLCO</a>). <a href="Carbon_monoxide" title="wikilink">Carbon monoxide</a> (CO) is tightly and rapidly bound to hemoglobin in the blood, so the partial pressure of CO in the capillaries is negligible and the second term in the denominator can be ignored. For this reason, CO is generally the test gas used to measure the diffusing capacity and the <span class="LaTeX">$D_L$</span> equation simplifies to:  = \frac {\dot{V}_{CO}} {P_{A_{CO}} }. | <mtpl><eqref>2<eqref></eqref></eqref></mtpl> }}</p>
<h2 id="test-performance">Test Performance</h2>
<p>The <strong>single-breath diffusing capacity test</strong> is the most common way to determine <span class="LaTeX">$D_L$</span>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The test is performed by having the subject blow out all of the air that he/she can, leaving only the <a href="Lung_volumes" title="wikilink">residual lung volume</a> of gas. The person then inhales a test gas mixture rapidly and completely, reaching the <a href="Lung_volumes" title="wikilink">total lung capacity</a> as nearly as possible. This test gas mixture contains a small amount of carbon monoxide (usually 0.3%) and a <em>tracer gas</em> that is freely distributed throughout the alveolar space but which doesn't cross the alveolar-capillary membrane. Helium and methane are two such gasses. The test gas is held in the lung for about 10 seconds during which time the CO (but <em>not</em> the tracer gas) continuously moves from the alveoli into the blood. Then the subject exhales.</p>
<p>The anatomy of the airways brings with it complications, since the inspired air must pass through the mouth, trachea, bronchi and bronchioles before it gets to the alveoli where gas exchange will occur; on exhalation, alveolar gas must return along the same path, and so the exhaled sample will be purely alveolar only after a 500 to 1,000 ml of gas has left the subject. While it is algebraically possible to approximate the effects of anatomy (the <em>three-equation method</em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>), disease states introduce considerable uncertainty to this approach. Instead, the first 500 to 1,000 ml of the expired gas is disregarded and the next portion which contain gas that has been in the alveoli is analyzed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> By analyzing the concentrations of carbon monoxide and inert gas in the inspired gas and in the exhaled gas, it is possible to calculate <span class="LaTeX">$(D_{L_{CO}})$</span> according to Equation <mtpl><eqref>2<eqref></eqref></eqref></mtpl>.

<p>Other methods that are not so widely used at present can measure the diffusing capacity. These include the steady state diffusing capacity that is performed during regular tidal breathing, or the rebreathing method that requires rebreathing from a reservoir of gas mixtures.</p>
<h2 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h2>
<p>In general, a healthy individual has a value of <span class="LaTeX">$D_{L_{CO}}$</span> between 75% and 125% of the average.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> However, individuals vary according to age, sex, height and a variety of other parameters. For this reason, reference values have been published, based on populations of healthy subjects<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> as well as measurements made at altitude,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> for children<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and some specific population groups.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="blood-co-levels-may-not-be-negligible">Blood CO levels may not be negligible</h3>
<p>In heavy smokers, blood CO is great enough to influence the measurement of <span class="LaTeX">$D_{L_{CO}}$</span>, and requires an adjustment of the calculation when COHb is greater than 2% of the whole.</p>
<h4 id="the-two-components-of-d_l_co">The two components of <span class="LaTeX">$D_{L_{CO}}$</span></h4>
<p>While <span class="LaTeX">$(D_L)$</span> is of great practical importance, being the overall measure of gas transport, the interpretation of this measurement is complicated by the fact that it does not measure any one part of a multi-step process. So as a conceptual aid in interpreting the results of this test, the time needed to transfer CO from the air to the blood can be divided into two parts. First CO crosses the alveolar capillary membrane (represented by <span class="LaTeX">$D_M$</span> ) and then CO combines with the hemoglobin in capillary red blood cells at a rate <span class="LaTeX">$\theta$</span> times the volume of capillary blood present (<span class="LaTeX">$V_c$</span>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Since the steps are in series, the conductances add as the sum of the reciprocals:</p>
<p>} =\frac {1} {D_M} + \frac {1} {\theta * V_c} . | <mtpl><eqref>3<eqref></eqref></eqref></mtpl> }}</p>
<h4 id="any-change-in-v_c-alters-d_l_co">Any change in <span class="LaTeX">$V_c$</span> alters <span class="LaTeX">$D_{L_{CO}}$</span></h4>
<p>The volume of blood in the lung capillaries, <span class="LaTeX">$V_c$</span>, changes appreciably during ordinary activities such as <a href="Physical_exercise" title="wikilink">exercise</a>. Simply breathing in brings some additional blood <em>into</em> the lung because of the negative intrathoracic pressure required for inspiration. At the extreme, inspiring against a closed glottis, the <a href="Müller's_maneuver" title="wikilink">Müller's maneuver</a>, pulls blood <em>into</em> the chest. The opposite is also true, as exhaling increases the pressure within the thorax and so tends to push blood out; the <a href="Valsalva_maneuver" title="wikilink">Valsalva maneuver</a> is an exhalation against a closed airway which can move blood <em>out</em> of the lung. So breathing hard during exercise will bring extra blood into the lung during inspiration and push blood out during expiration. But during exercise (or more rarely when there is a <a href="Atrioventricular_septal_defect" title="wikilink">structural defect</a> in the heart that allows blood to be shunted from the high pressure, systemic circulation to the low pressure, pulmonary circulation) there is also increased blood flow throughout the body, and the lung adapts by recruiting extra capillaries to carry the increased output of the heart, further increasing the quantity of blood in the lung. Thus <span class="LaTeX">$D_{L_{CO}}$</span> will appear to increase when the subject is not at rest, particularly during inspiration.</p>
<p>In disease, <a href="Pulmonary_hemorrhage" title="wikilink">hemorrhage</a> into the lung will the number of haemoglobin molecules in contact with air, and so measured <span class="LaTeX">$D_{L_{CO}}$</span> will increase. In this case, the carbon monoxide used in the test will bind to haemoglobin that has bled into the lung. This does not reflect an increase in diffusing capacity of the lung to transfer oxygen to the systemic circulation.</p>
<p>Finally, <span class="LaTeX">$V_c$</span> is increased in <strong><a class="uri" href="obesity" title="wikilink">obesity</a></strong> and when the subject lies down, both of which increase the blood in the lung by compression and by gravity and thus both increase <span class="LaTeX">$D_{L_{CO}}$</span>.</p>
<h4 id="reasons-why-theta-varies">Reasons why <span class="LaTeX">$\theta$</span> varies</h4>
<p>The rate of CO uptake into the blood, <span class="LaTeX">$\theta$</span>, depends on the concentration of hemoglobin in that blood, abbreviated <a href="Hemoglobin" title="wikilink">Hb</a> in the CBC (<a href="Complete_Blood_Count" title="wikilink">Complete Blood Count</a>). More hemoglobin is present in <a class="uri" href="polycythemia" title="wikilink">polycythemia</a>, and so <span class="LaTeX">$D_{L_{CO}}$</span> is elevated. In <a class="uri" href="anemia" title="wikilink">anemia</a>, the opposite is true. In environments with high levels of CO in the inhaled air (such as <a class="uri" href="smoking" title="wikilink">smoking</a>), a fraction of the blood's hemoglobin is rendered ineffective by its tight binding to CO, and so is analogous to anemia. It is recommended that <span class="LaTeX">$D_{L_{CO}}$</span> be adjusted when blood CO is high.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>The lung blood volume is also reduced when blood flow is interrupted by blood clots (<a href="pulmonary_emboli" title="wikilink">pulmonary emboli</a>) or reduced by bone deformities of the thorax, for instance <a class="uri" href="scoliosis" title="wikilink">scoliosis</a> and <a class="uri" href="kyphosis" title="wikilink">kyphosis</a>.</p>
<p>Varying the ambient concentration of oxygen also alters <span class="LaTeX">$\theta$</span>. At high altitude, inspired oxygen is low and more of the blood's hemoglobin is free to bind CO; thus <span class="LaTeX">$\theta$</span> is increased and <span class="LaTeX">$D_{L_{CO}}$</span> appears to be increased. Conversely, supplemental oxygen increases Hb saturation, decreasing <span class="LaTeX">$\theta$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$D_{L_{CO}}$</span>.</p>
<h4 id="lung-diseases-that-reduce-d_m-and-theta-v_c">Lung diseases that reduce <span class="LaTeX">$D_M$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\theta * V_c$</span></h4>
<p>Diseases that alter lung tissue reduce both <span class="LaTeX">$D_M$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\theta * V_c$</span> to a variable extent, and so decrease <span class="LaTeX">$D_{L_{CO}}$</span>.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>In one sense, it is remarkable that DL<sub>CO</sub> has retained such clinical utility. The technique was invented to settle one of the great controversies of pulmonary physiology a century ago, namely the question of whether oxygen and the other gases were actively transported into and out of the blood by the lung, or whether gas molecules diffused passively.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Remarkable too is the fact that both sides used the technique to gain evidence for their respective hypotheses. To begin with, <a href="Christian_Bohr" title="wikilink">Christian Bohr</a> invented the technique, using a protocol analogous to the steady state diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide, and concluded that oxygen was actively transported into the lung. His student, <a href="August_Krogh" title="wikilink">August Krogh</a> developed the single breath diffusion capacity technique along with his wife <a href="August_Krogh" title="wikilink">Marie</a>, and convincingly demonstrated that gasses diffuse passively,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> a finding that led to the demonstration that capillaries in the blood were recruited into use as needed – a Nobel Prize–winning idea.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
