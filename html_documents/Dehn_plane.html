<h1>Dehn plane</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="geometry" title="wikilink">geometry</a>, Dehn introduced two examples of planes, a <strong>semi-Euclidean geometry</strong> and a <strong>non-Legendrian geometry</strong>, that have infinitely many lines parallel to a given one that pass through a given point, but where the sum of the angles of a triangle is at least π. A similar phenomenon occurs in <a href="hyperbolic_geometry" title="wikilink">hyperbolic geometry</a>, except that the sum of the angles of a triangle is less than π. Dehn's examples use a non-Archimedean field, so that the <a href="Archimedean_axiom" title="wikilink">Archimedean axiom</a> is violated. They were introduced by  and discussed by .</p>

<p>To construct his geometries, Dehn used a <a href="Archimedean_property" title="wikilink">non-Archimedean</a> ordered <a href="Pythagorean_field" title="wikilink">Pythagorean field</a> Ω(<em>t</em>), a <a href="Pythagorean_closure" title="wikilink">Pythagorean closure</a> of the field of rational functions <strong>R</strong>(<em>t</em>), consisting of the smallest field of real-valued functions on the real line containing the real constants, the identity function <em>t</em> (taking any real number to itself) and closed under the operation ω → √(1+ω<sup>2</sup>). The field Ω(<em>t</em>) is ordered by putting <em>x</em>&gt;<em>y</em> if the function <em>x</em> is larger than <em>y</em> for sufficiently large reals. An element <em>x</em> of Ω(<em>t</em>) is called <strong>finite</strong> if <em>m</em>| |(x,y)| | = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}, \, </p>

<p>which takes values in Ω(<em>t</em>), gives a model of <a href="Euclidean_geometry" title="wikilink">Euclidean geometry</a>. The parallel postulate is true in this model, but if the deviation from the perpendicular is infinitesimal (meaning smaller than any positive rational number), the intersecting lines intersect at a point that is not in the finite part of the plane. Hence, if the model is restricted to the finite part of the plane (points (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) with <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> finite), a geometry is obtained in which the parallel postulate fails but the sum of the angles of a triangle is π. This is Dehn's semi-Euclidean geometry. It is discussed in .</p>
<h2 id="dehns-non-legendrian-geometry">Dehn's non-Legendrian geometry</h2>

<p>In the same paper, Dehn also constructed an example of a non-Legendrian geometry where there are infinitely many lines through a point not meeting another line, but the sum of the angles in a triangle exceeds π. Riemann's <a href="elliptic_geometry" title="wikilink">elliptic geometry</a> over Ω(<em>t</em>) consists of the projective plane over Ω(<em>t</em>), which can be identified with the affine plane of points (<em>x</em>:<em>y</em>:1) together with the "line at infinity", and has the property that the sum of the angles of any triangle is greater than π The non-Legendrian geometry consists of the points (<em>x</em>:<em>y</em>:1) of this affine subspace such that <em>tx</em> and <em>ty</em> are finite (where as above <em>t</em> is the element of Ω(<em>t</em>) represented by the identity function). <a href="Saccheri–Legendre_theorem" title="wikilink">Legendre's theorem</a> states that the sum of the angles of a triangle is at most π, but assumes Archimedes's axiom, and Dehn's example shows that Legendre's theorem need not hold if Archimedes' axiom is dropped.</p>
