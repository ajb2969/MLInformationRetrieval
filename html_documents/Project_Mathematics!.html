<h1>Project Mathematics!</h1>
<hr/>
<p><strong><em>Project Mathematics!</em></strong> (stylized as <strong><em>Project MATHEMATICS!</em></strong>), is a series of educational video modules and accompanying workbooks for teachers, developed to help teach the principles of mathematics to high school students.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The <em>Project Mathematics!</em> series of videos is a teaching aid for teachers to help students understand the basics of <a class="uri" href="geometry" title="wikilink">geometry</a> and <a class="uri" href="trigonometry" title="wikilink">trigonometry</a>. The series was developed by Dr. <a href="Tom_M._Apostol" title="wikilink">Tom M. Apostol</a> and Dr. <a href="James_F._Blinn" title="wikilink">James F. Blinn</a>, both from the <a href="California_Institute_of_Technology" title="wikilink">California Institute of Technology</a>. Apostol heads the production of the series while Blinn provides the <a href="computer_animation" title="wikilink">computer animation</a> used to depict the ideas beings discussed. Blinn mentioned that part of his inspiration was the <a href="The_Bell_Laboratory_Science_Series" title="wikilink">Bell science series</a> of films from the 1950s.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The material is designed for teachers to use in their curriculums and is aimed at grades 8 through 13. Workbooks are also available to accompany the videos and help assist teachers in presenting the material to their students. The videos are distributed as either 9 VHS videotapes or 3 DVDs and include a history of mathematics and examples of how math is used in real world applications.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="video-module-descriptions">Video module descriptions</h2>
<p>A total of nine educational video modules were created between 1988 and 2000. Another two modules, <em>Teachers Workshop</em> and <em>Project MATHEMATICS! Contest</em>, were created in 1991 for teachers and are only available on videotape. The content of the nine educational modules follows below.</p>
<h3 id="the-theorem-of-pythagoras">The Theorem of Pythagoras</h3>
<p> In 1988, <em>The Theorem of Pythagoras</em> was the first video produced by the series and reviews the <a href="Pythagorean_theorem" title="wikilink">Pythagorean theorem</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> For all <a href="right_triangle" title="wikilink">right triangles</a>, the square of the <a class="uri" href="hypotenuse" title="wikilink">hypotenuse</a> is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides ( a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup> ). The <a class="uri" href="theorem" title="wikilink">theorem</a> is named after <a class="uri" href="Pythagoras" title="wikilink">Pythagoras</a> of ancient Greece. <a href="Pythagorean_triple" title="wikilink">Pythagorean triples</a> occur when all three sides of a right triangle are <a href="integer" title="wikilink">integers</a> such as a = 3, b = 4 and c = 5. A <a href="Plimpton_322" title="wikilink">clay tablet</a> shows that the <a href="Babylonia" title="wikilink">Babylonians</a> knew of Pythagorean triples 1200 years before Pythagoras, but nobody knows if they knew the Pythagorean theorem. The <a href="Zhou_Bi_Suan_Jing" title="wikilink">Chinese proof</a> uses four similar triangles to prove the theorem. Today, we know of the Pythagorean theorem because of <a href="Euclid's_Elements" title="wikilink">Euclid's Elements</a>, a set of 13 books on mathematics—from around 300 BC—and the knowledge it contained has been used for more than 2000 years. <a href="Pythagorean_theorem#Euclid's_proof" title="wikilink">Euclid's proof</a> is described in book 1, proposition 47 and uses the idea of equal areas along with <a href="Shear_mapping" title="wikilink">shearing</a> and <a href="Rotation_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">rotating</a> triangles. In the <em>dissection proof</em>, the square of the hypotenuse is cut into pieces to fit into the other two squares. Proposition 31 in book 6 of Euclid's Elements describes the <a href="Pythagorean_theorem#Similar_figures_on_the_three_sides" title="wikilink">similarity proof</a>, which states that the squares of each side can be replaced by shapes that are <a href="Similarity_(geometry)" title="wikilink">similar</a> to each other and the proof still works.</p>
<h3 id="the-story-of-pi">The Story of Pi</h3>
<p> The second module created was <em>The Story of Pi</em>, in 1989, and describes <a class="uri" href="pi" title="wikilink">pi</a> and its history.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The first letter in the Greek word for perimeter, περίμετρος, is <span class="LaTeX">$\pi$</span>, known in English as pi. Pi is the <a class="uri" href="ratio" title="wikilink">ratio</a> of a <a class="uri" href="circle" title="wikilink">circle</a>'s <a class="uri" href="circumference" title="wikilink">circumference</a> to its <a class="uri" href="diameter" title="wikilink">diameter</a> and is roughly equal to 3.14159. The circumference of a circle is <span class="LaTeX">$2 \pi r$</span> and its area is <span class="LaTeX">$\pi r^2$</span>. The <a class="uri" href="volume" title="wikilink">volume</a> and <a href="surface_area" title="wikilink">surface area</a> of a <a href="Cylinder_(geometry)" title="wikilink">cylinder</a>, <a href="Cone_(geometry)" title="wikilink">cone</a> <a class="uri" href="sphere" title="wikilink">sphere</a> and <a class="uri" href="torus" title="wikilink">torus</a> are calculated using pi. Pi is also used in calculating planetary orbit times, <a href="gaussian_curve" title="wikilink">gaussian curves</a> and alternating current. In <a class="uri" href="calculus" title="wikilink">calculus</a>, there are <a href="infinite_series" title="wikilink">infinite series</a> that involve pi and pi is used in <a class="uri" href="trigonometry" title="wikilink">trigonometry</a>. Ancient cultures used different approximations for pi. The Babylonian's used <span class="LaTeX">$$</span> \tfrac{25}{8}  and the <a href="Ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">Egyptians</a> used <span class="LaTeX">$$</span> \tfrac{256}{81} . Pi is a <a href="fundamental_constant" title="wikilink">fundamental constant</a> of nature. <a class="uri" href="Archimedes" title="wikilink">Archimedes</a> discovered that the area of the circle equals the square of its <a class="uri" href="radius" title="wikilink">radius</a> times pi. Archimedes was the first to accurately calculate pi by using <a href="polygon" title="wikilink">polygons</a> with 96 sides both inside and outside a circle then measuring the line segments and finding that pi was between <span class="LaTeX">$$</span> \tfrac{223}{71}  and <span class="LaTeX">$$</span> \tfrac{22}{7} . A Chinese calculation used polygons with 3,000 sides and calculated pi accurately to five <a href="decimal_places" title="wikilink">decimal places</a>. The Chinese also found that <span class="LaTeX">$$</span> \tfrac{355}{113}  was an accurate estimate of pi to within 6 decimal places and was the most accurate estimate for 1,000 years until <a href="arabic_numerals" title="wikilink">arabic numerals</a> were used for <a class="uri" href="arithmetic" title="wikilink">arithmetic</a>. By the end of the 19th century, <a class="uri" href="formulas" title="wikilink">formulas</a> were discovered to calculate pi without the need for geometric diagrams. These formulas used infinite series and <a href="trigonometric_functions" title="wikilink">trigonometric functions</a> to calculate pi to hundreds of decimal places. Computers were used in the 20th century to calculate pi and its value was known to one billion decimals places by 1989. One reason to accurately calculate pi is to test the performance of computers. Another reason is to determine if pi is a specific <a href="Fraction_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">fraction</a>, which is a ratio of two <a class="uri" href="integers" title="wikilink">integers</a> called a <a href="rational_number" title="wikilink">rational number</a> that has a repeating pattern of <a href="Numerical_digit" title="wikilink">digits</a> when expressed in decimal form. In the 18th century, <a href="Johann_Heinrich_Lambert" title="wikilink">Johann Lambert</a> found that pi cannot be a ratio and is therefore an <a href="irrational_number" title="wikilink">irrational number</a>. Pi shows up in many areas having nothing to do with circles. For example; the fraction of points on a <a href="Lattice_graph" title="wikilink">lattice</a> viewable from an origin point is equal to <span class="LaTeX">$\tfrac{6}{\pi^2}$</span>.</p>
<h3 id="similarity">Similarity</h3>
<p>Discusses how scaling objects does not change their shape and how angles stay the same. Also shows how ratios change for perimeters, areas and volumes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="sines-and-cosines-part-i-waves">Sines and Cosines, Part I (Waves)</h3>
<p>Visually depicts how <a href="sine" title="wikilink">sines</a> and cosines are related to waves and a <a href="unit_circle" title="wikilink">unit circle</a>. Also reviews their relationship to the ratios of side lengths of <a href="right_triangle" title="wikilink">right triangles</a>.</p>
<h3 id="sines-and-cosines-part-ii-trigonometry">Sines and Cosines, Part II (Trigonometry)</h3>
<p>Explains the <a href="law_of_sines" title="wikilink">law of sines</a> and <a href="Law_of_cosines" title="wikilink">cosines</a> how they relate to sides and angles of a triangle. The module also gives some real life examples of their use.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="sines-and-cosines-part-iii-addition-formulas">Sines and Cosines, Part III (Addition formulas)</h3>
<p>Describes the <a href="Angle_addition_formulas" title="wikilink">addition formulas of sines and cosines</a> and discusses the history of <a class="uri" href="Ptolemy" title="wikilink">Ptolemy</a>'s <a class="uri" href="Almagest" title="wikilink">Almagest</a>. It also goes into details of <a href="Ptolemy's_Theorem" title="wikilink">Ptolemy's Theorem</a>. Animation shows how sines and cosines relate to <a href="harmonic_motion" title="wikilink">harmonic motion</a>.</p>
<h3 id="polynomials">Polynomials</h3>
<p>How <a href="polynomial" title="wikilink">polynomials</a> can approximate sines and cosines. Includes information about <a href="cubic_spline" title="wikilink">cubic splines</a> in design engineering.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-tunnel-of-samos">The Tunnel of Samos</h3>
<p>How did the ancients dig the <a href="tunnel_of_Samos" title="wikilink">tunnel of Samos</a> from two opposite sides of a mountain in 500 BC? And how were they able to meet under the mountain? Maybe they used geometry and trigonometry.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
