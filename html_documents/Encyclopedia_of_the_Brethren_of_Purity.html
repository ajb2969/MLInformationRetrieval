<h1>Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>Encyclopedia of the <a href="Brethren_of_Purity" title="wikilink">Brethren of Purity</a></strong> () also variously known as the "Epistles of the Brethren of Sincerity", "Epistles of the Brethren of Purity" and "Epistles of the Brethren of Purity and Loyal Friends" was a large <a class="uri" href="encyclopedia" title="wikilink">encyclopedia</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> in 52 <a href="treatise" title="wikilink">treatises</a> (<em>rasā'il</em>) written by the mysterious<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <a href="Brethren_of_Purity" title="wikilink">Brethren of Purity</a> of <a href="Basra,_Iraq" title="wikilink">Basra, Iraq</a> sometime in the second half of the 10th century <a href="Common_Era" title="wikilink">CE</a> (or possibly later, in the 11th century). It had a great influence on later intellectual leading lights of the Muslim world, such as <a href="Ibn_Arabi" title="wikilink">Ibn Arabi</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and was transmitted as far abroad within the <a href="Muslim_world" title="wikilink">Muslim world</a> as <a class="uri" href="Al-Andalus" title="wikilink">Al-Andalus</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The <em>Encyclopedia</em> contributed to the popularization and legitimization of <a class="uri" href="Platonism" title="wikilink">Platonism</a> in the Arabic world.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>The identity and period of the authors of the <em>Encyclopedia</em> have not been conclusively established,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> though the work has been linked with as varied groups as the <a class="uri" href="Isma'ili" title="wikilink">Isma'ili</a>, <a class="uri" href="Sufi" title="wikilink">Sufi</a>, <a class="uri" href="Sunni" title="wikilink">Sunni</a>, <a class="uri" href="Mu'tazili" title="wikilink">Mu'tazili</a>, <a class="uri" href="Nusairi" title="wikilink">Nusairi</a>, <a class="uri" href="Rosicrucians" title="wikilink">Rosicrucians</a>, etc.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>The subject of the work is vast and ranges from mathematics, music, astronomy, and natural sciences, to ethics, politics, religion, and magic—all compiled for one, basic purpose, that learning is training for the soul and a preparation for its eventual life once freed from the body.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> <mtpl></mtpl></p>
<h2 id="authorship">Authorship</h2>

<p>Authorship of the <em>Encyclopedia</em> is usually ascribed to the mysterious "<a href="Brethren_of_Purity" title="wikilink">Brethren of Purity</a>" a group of scholars placed in <a class="uri" href="Basra" title="wikilink">Basra</a>, <a class="uri" href="Iraq" title="wikilink">Iraq</a> sometime around 10th century CE.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> While it is generally accepted that it was the group who authored at least the 52 rasa'il,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> the authorship of the "Summary" (<em>al-Risalat al-Jami'a</em>) is uncertain; it has been ascribed to the later <a class="uri" href="Majriti" title="wikilink">Majriti</a> but this has been disproved by Yves Marquet (see the <a href="#Risalat_al-Jami'a" title="wikilink"><em>Risalat al-Jami'a</em> section</a>). Since style of the text is plain, and there are numerous ambiguities, due to language and vocabulary, often of <a href="Persian_language" title="wikilink">Persian</a> origin, it is believed the authors were of <a href="Persian_people" title="wikilink">Persian</a> descent.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>Further perplexities abound; the use of pronouns for the authorial "sender" of the <em>rasa'il</em> is not consistent, with the writer occasionally slipping from <a href="Grammatical_person" title="wikilink">third person</a> to first-person (for example, in Epistle 44, "The Doctrine of the Sincere Brethren").<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> This has led some to suggest that the <em>rasa'il</em> were not in fact written co-operatively by a group or consolidated notes from lectures and discussions, but were actually the work of a single person.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Of course, if one accepts the longer time spans proposed for the composition of the <em>Encyclopedia</em>, or the simpler possibility that each <em>risala</em> was written by a separate person, sole authorship would be impossible.</p>
<h2 id="contents">Contents</h2>

<p>The subject matter of the <em>Rasa'il</em> is vast and ranges from mathematics, music, logic, astronomy, the physical and natural sciences, as well as exploring the nature of the soul and investigating associated matters in ethics, revelation, and spirituality.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>Its philosophical outlook was <a href="Neoplatonism" title="wikilink">Neoplatonic</a> and it tried to integrate <a href="Greek_philosophy" title="wikilink">Greek philosophy</a> (and especially the <a href="Dialectic" title="wikilink">dialectical reasoning</a> and <a class="uri" href="logic" title="wikilink">logic</a> of <a href="Aristotle" title="wikilink">Aristotelianism</a>) with various <a href="Astrology" title="wikilink">astrological</a>, <a href="Hermeticism" title="wikilink">Hermetic</a>, <a href="Gnosticism" title="wikilink">Gnostic</a> and <a href="Islam" title="wikilink">Islamic</a> schools of thought. Scholars have seen <a class="uri" href="Ismaili" title="wikilink">Ismaili</a><ref>Some have claimed that the Brethren <em>were</em> Ismaili, though this may be unlikely because of their very lukewarm embrace of the <a href="Shi'a_Imam" title="wikilink">Imamate</a> and other aspects of Ismailian theology, in addition to the lack of solid evidence in favor of such a hypothesis.</ref></p>
<ul>
<li>This is not to say that there aren't some suggestive links between the Brethren and the Isma'ili. Heinz Halm notes in his "The cosmology of the pre-Fatimid Isma'iliyya" (as printed in <em>Medieval Isma'ili History and Thought</em>, ed. Farhad Daftary, 1996, ISBN 0-521-45140-X) that the Sunni theologian <a href="Ibn_Taymiyya" title="wikilink">Ibn Taymiyya</a> (d. 1328) asserted that the doctrines of the Brethren were exactly identical to the Ismaili's in one of his <a href="fatwa" title="wikilink">fatwas</a>. Halm further notes that Paul Casanova had shown that the infamous <a class="uri" href="Hashshashin" title="wikilink">Hashshashin</a> had approved of the <em>Encyclopedia</em> and that their missionaries in <a class="uri" href="Yemen" title="wikilink">Yemen</a> even made use of it. Other sects apparently drew upon the <em>Encyclopedia</em> as well: "The theological treatises of the <a class="uri" href="Tayyibi" title="wikilink">Tayyibi</a> Ismailis of the <a class="uri" href="Yemen" title="wikilink">Yemen</a> contain ample quotations from the <em>Rasa'il Ikhwan al-Safa'</em>, and in the <em>'Uyun al-akhbar</em> by the Yemenite <em>da'i</em> Idris 'Imad al-Din (d. 1468), Ahmad b. 'Abd Allah b. Muhammad b. Isma'il b. Ja'far al-Sadiq, the ninth imam and the second of the leaders of the Isma'ili <em>da'wa</em> residing in Salamiyya, is explicitly named as the author as the <em>Rasa'il</em>." (pg 76) Indeed, the respect of some Ismaili was great indeed, some referring to it as "a Quran after the Quran" (Nasr, 1964, pg. 26). V. A. Ivanov remarks in his <em>The Alleged Founders of Ismailism</em> (<a class="uri" href="Bombay" title="wikilink">Bombay</a>, 1946), that "the work is accepted by the Isma'ili as belonging to their religion, and is still regarded as esoteric..."</li>
<li>But there are more reasons to reject an identification of the Brethren with Isma'ili, such as the failure of <a href="Hamid_al-Din_al-Kirmani" title="wikilink">Hamid al-Din al-Kirmani</a>, an extremely important Islamic theologian, to make any mention of them. And other authors agree with this: "...the well-known modern Isma'ili scholar, H. F. al-Hamdani, although emphasizing the importance of the <em>Rasa'il</em> in the Isma'ili mission in the Yemen, disclaims Isma'ili authorship of the work and instead attributes the treatises to the 'Alids." (Amusingly, V. A. Ivanov attributes sponsorship of the work to the 'Alids' enemies, the Fatimids, instead, in his <em>A Guide to Ismaili Literature</em>, London 1933) From pg 26-27 of Nasr (1964).</li>
<li>From pg 8 of Tibawi: "There is sufficient evidence in the tracts themselves to prove Isma'ili sympathies. Indeed, such sympathies have long been pointed out by Muslim authors, medieval and modern, who tried to turn sympathy into actual relationship. However, the balance of evidence tends to show that such relationship was a later development. There is as yet no proof that the formation of Ikhwan as-Safa and the publication of their <em>Rasa'il</em> was an Isma'ili movement, or even a movement concerted with any of the contemporary agitation of the Shi'a." From page 9: "A glaring example of the Ikhwan's independence is their advocacy of the principle that the office of <em>imam</em> need not be hereditary, for they argue that if the desired good qualities are not found in one single person but scattered among a group, then the group and not the individual should be 'the lord of the time and the <em>imam</em>. More surprising still is the denouncement of the belief in a concealed <em>imam</em> as painful to those who hold it and the discredit of the significance of 'number seven' and those who believe in it as contrary to the Ikhwan's creed."</li>
<li>Compare this extract from one of the later rasa'il Netton provides on pg 102 of his <em>Muslim Neoplatonists</em>: "Know, O Brother, that if these qualities are united simultaneously in one human being, during one of the cycles of astral conjunctions, then that person is the Delegate (<em>al-Mab'uth</em>) and the Master of the Age (<em>Sahib al-Zaman</em>) and the Imam for the people as long as he lives, If he fulfills his mission and accomplishes his allotted task, advises the community and records the revelation, codifies its interpretation and consolidates the holy law, clarifies its method and implements the traditional procedures and welds the community into one; if he does all that and then dies and passes away, those qualities will remain in the community as its heritage. If those qualities, or most of them, are united in one in his community, then he is the man suited to be his successor in his community after his death. But if it does not happen that those qualities are united in one man, but are scattered among all its members, and they speak with one voice and their hearts are united in love for each other, and they cooperate in supporting the faith, preserving the law and implementing the <em><a href="Sunnah" title="wikilink">sunna</a></em>, and bearing the community along the path of religion, then their dynasty will endure in this world and the outcome will be happy for them in the next." and <a href="Sufism" title="wikilink">Sufi</a> influences in the religious content, and <a href="Mu'tazili" title="wikilink">Mu'tazilite</a> acceptance of reasoning in the work.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Others, however, hold the Brethren to be "free-thinkers" who transcended sectarian divisions and were not bound by the doctrines of any specific creed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Their unabashed <a class="uri" href="eclecticism" title="wikilink">eclecticism</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> is fairly unusual in this period of Arabic thought, characterised by fierce theological disputes; they refused to condemn rival schools of thought or religions, instead insisting that they be examined fairly and open-mindedly for what truth they may contain: <mtpl></mtpl></p>

<p>In total, they cover most of the areas an educated person was expected to understand in that era. The epistles (or <em>"rasa'il"</em>) generally increase in abstractness, finally dealing with the Brethren's somewhat <a href="pantheism" title="wikilink">pantheistic</a> philosophy, in which each soul is an emanation, a fragment of a universal soul with which it will reunite at death;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> in turn, the universal soul will reunite with <a class="uri" href="Allah" title="wikilink">Allah</a> on <a href="Qiyamah" title="wikilink">Doomsday</a>. The epistles are intended to transmit right knowledge, leading to harmony with the universe and happiness.</p>
<h3 id="organization">Organization</h3>

<p>Organizationally, it is divided into 52 <a class="uri" href="epistles" title="wikilink">epistles</a>. The 52 rasa'il are subdivided into four sections, sometimes called books (indeed, some complete editions of the <em>Encyclopedia</em> are in four volumes); in order, they are: 14 on the Mathematical Sciences, 17 on the Natural Sciences, 10 on the Psychological and Rational Sciences, 11 on Theological Sciences.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>The division into four sections is no accident; the number four held great importance in Neoplatonic <a class="uri" href="numerology" title="wikilink">numerology</a>, being the first <a href="square_number" title="wikilink">square number</a> and for being even. Reputedly, <a class="uri" href="Pythagoras" title="wikilink">Pythagoras</a> held that a man's life was divided into four sections, much like a year was divided into four seasons. The Brethren divided mathematics itself into four sections: <a class="uri" href="arithmetic" title="wikilink">arithmetic</a> was Pythagoras and <a class="uri" href="Nicomachus" title="wikilink">Nicomachus</a>' domain; <a class="uri" href="Ptolemy" title="wikilink">Ptolemy</a> ruled over <a class="uri" href="astronomy" title="wikilink">astronomy</a> with his <em><a class="uri" href="Almagest" title="wikilink">Almagest</a></em>; <a class="uri" href="geometry" title="wikilink">geometry</a> was associated with <a class="uri" href="Euclid" title="wikilink">Euclid</a>, naturally; and the fourth and last division was that of <a class="uri" href="music" title="wikilink">music</a>. The fours did not cease there- the Brethren observed that four was crucial to a <a class="uri" href="decimal" title="wikilink">decimal</a> system, as

; numbers themselves were broken down into four <a href="orders_of_magnitude" title="wikilink">orders of magnitude</a>: the ones, tens, hundreds, and thousands; there were four winds from the four directions (north, south, east, west); medicine concerned itself with the <a href="four_humours" title="wikilink">four humours</a>, and natural philosophers with the four <a href="Classical_element" title="wikilink">elements</a> of <a class="uri" href="Empedocles" title="wikilink">Empedocles</a>.</p>

<p>Another possibility, suggested by Netton is that the veneration for four stems instead from the Brethren's great interest in the <em><a href="Corpus_Hermeticum" title="wikilink">Corpus Hermeticum</a></em> of <a href="Hermes_Trismegistus" title="wikilink">Hermes Trismegistus</a> (identified with the god <a class="uri" href="Hermes" title="wikilink">Hermes</a>, to whom the number four was sacred); that hermetic tradition's magical lore was the main subject of the 51st rasa'il.</p>

<p>Netton mentions that there are suggestions that the 52nd rasa'il (on talismans and magic) is a later addition to the <em>Encyclopedia</em>, because of intertextual evidence: a number of the rasa'ils claim that the total of rasa'ils is 51. However, the 52nd rasa'il itself claims to be number 51 in one area, and number 52 in another, leading to the possibility that the Brethren's attraction for the number 51 (or 17 times 3; there were 17 rasa'ils on <a href="natural_science" title="wikilink">natural sciences</a>) is responsible for the confusion. Seyyed Hossein Nasr suggests that the origin of the preference for 17 stemmed from the <a href="alchemy" title="wikilink">alchemist</a> <a href="Jābir_ibn_Hayyān" title="wikilink">Jābir ibn Hayyān</a>'s numerological symbolism.</p>
<h4 id="risalat-al-jamia">Risalat al-Jami'a</h4>

<p>Besides the fifty-odd epistles, there exists what claims to be overarching summary of the work, which is not counted in the 52, called "The Summary" (<em>al-Risalat al-Jami'a</em>) which exists in two versions. The Summary, interestingly enough, has been claimed to have been the work of <a href="Maslamah_Ibn_Ahmad_al-Majriti" title="wikilink">Majriti</a> (d. <em>circa</em> 1008), although Netton states Majriti could not have composed it, and that Yves Marquet concludes from a philological analysis of the vocabulary and style in his <em>La Philosophie des Ihwan al-Safa</em> (1975) that it had to have been composed at the same time as the main corpus.</p>
<h3 id="style">Style</h3>

<p>Like conventional Arabic Islamic works, the Epistles have no lack of time-worn honorifics and quotations from the Qur'an,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> but the <em>Encyclopedia</em> is also famous for some of the <a href="Didacticism" title="wikilink">didactic</a> <a href="fable" title="wikilink">fables</a> it sprinkled throughout the text; a particular one, the "Island of Animals" or the "Debate of Animals" (embedded within the 22nd rasa'il, titled "On How The Animals and their Kinds are Formed"), is one of the most popular animal fables in <a class="uri" href="Islam" title="wikilink">Islam</a>. The fable concerns how 70 men, nearly shipwrecked, discover an island where animals ruled, and began to settle on it. They oppressed and killed the animals, who unused to such harsh treatment, complained to the King (or Shah) of Djinns. The King arranged a series of debates between the humans and various representatives of the animals, such as the nightingale, the bee, and the jackal. The animals nearly defeat the humans, but an Arabian ends the series by pointing out that there was one way in which humans were superior to animals and so worthy of making animals their servants: they were the only ones Allah had offered the chance of eternal life to. The King was convinced by this argument, and granted his judgement to them, but strongly cautioned them that the same Qur'an that supported them also promised them hellfire should they mistreat their animals.</p>
<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>

<p>More metaphysical were the four ranks (or "spiritual principles"), which apparently were an elaboration of <a class="uri" href="Plotinus" title="wikilink">Plotinus</a>' triad of Thought, Soul, and the One, known to the Brethren through the <em>Theologia of Aristotle</em> (a version of Plotinus' <em><a class="uri" href="Enneads" title="wikilink">Enneads</a></em> in Arabic, modified with changes and paraphrases, and attributed to <a class="uri" href="Aristotle" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a>);<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> first, the Creator (<em>al-Bārī</em>) emanated down to Universal Intellect (<em>al-'Aql al-Kullī</em>), then to Universal Soul (<em>al-Nafs</em>), and through Prime Matter (<em>al-Hayūlā al-Ūlā</em>), which emanated still further down through (and creating) the mundane hierarchy. The mundane hierarchy consisted of Nature (<em>al-Tabī'a</em>), the Absolute Body (<em>al-Jism al-Mutlaq</em>), the Sphere (<em>al-Falak</em>), the Four Elements (<em>al-Arkān</em>), and the Beings of this world (<em>al-Muwalladāt</em>) in their three varieties of animals, minerals, and vegetables, for a total hierarchy of nine members. Furthermore, each member increased in subdivisions proportional to how far down in the hierarchy it was, for instance, Sphere, being number seven has the seven <a href="planet" title="wikilink">planets</a> as its members.</p>

<p>Another area in which the Brethren differed was in their conceptions of nature, in which they rejected the emanation of Forms that characterized Platonic philosophy for a quasi-Aristotelian system of <a href="Substance_theory" title="wikilink">substances</a>: <mtpl></mtpl> <mtpl></mtpl></p>

<p>The 14th edition (EB-2:187a; 14th Ed., 1930) of the <a href="Encyclopædia_Britannica" title="wikilink">Encyclopædia Britannica</a> described the mingling of Neoplatonism and Aristotelianism this way: <mtpl></mtpl></p>
<h3 id="evolution">Evolution</h3>

<p>The text in the "Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity" describes biological diversity in a manner similar to the modern day theory of evolution. The contexts of such passages are interpreted differently by scholars.</p>

<p>In this document some modern day scholars note that “chain of being described by the Ikhwan possess a temporal aspect which has led certain scholars to view that the authors of the Rasai’l believed in the modern theory of evolution”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> According to the Rasa’il “But individuals are in perpetual flow; they are neither definite nor preserved. The reason for the conservation of forms, genus and species in matter is fixity of their celestial cause because their efficient cause is the Universal Soul of the spheres instead of the change and continuous flux of individuals which is due to the variability of their cause”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> This statement is supporting the concept that species and individuals are not static, and that when they change it is due to a new purpose given. In the Ikhwan doctrine there are similarities between that and the theory of evolution. Both believe that “the time of existence of terrestrial plants precedes that of animals, minerals precede plants, and organism adapt to their environment”,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> but asserts that everything exists for a purpose.</p>

<p><a href="Muhammad_Hamidullah" title="wikilink">Muhammad Hamidullah</a> describes the ideas on <a class="uri" href="evolution" title="wikilink">evolution</a> found in the <em>Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity</em> (<em>The Epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa</em>) as follows:</p>

<p><a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a> translations of the <em>Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity</em> were available from 1812, hence this work may have had an influence on <a href="Charles_Darwin" title="wikilink">Charles Darwin</a> and his inception of <a class="uri" href="Darwinism" title="wikilink">Darwinism</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn1">"The work only professes to be an epitome, an outline; its authors lay claim to no originality, they only summarize what others have thought and discovered. What they do lay claim to is system and completeness. The work does profess to contain a <em>systematized</em>, harmonious and co-ordinated view of the universe and life, its origin and destiny, formed out of many discordant, incoherent views; and it does claim to be a 'complete account of all things' - to contain, in epitome, all that was known at the time it was written.  It refers to more profound and special treatises for fuller information on the several sciences it touches upon, but it does claim to touch on all sciences, all departments of knowledge, and to set forth their leading results. In effect, it is, by its own showing, a 'hand-encyclopedia of Arabian philosophy in the tenth century'. It is not easy to exaggerate the importance of this encyclopedia. Its value lies in its completeness, in its systematizing of the results of Persian study." <a href="Stanley_Lane-Poole" title="wikilink">Stanley Lane-Poole</a> (1883), pages 190, 191.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn2">"Having been hidden within the cloak of secrecy from its very inception, the <em>Rasa'il</em> have provided many points of contention and have been a constant source of dispute among both Muslim and Western scholars.
