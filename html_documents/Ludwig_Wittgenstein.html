<h1>Ludwig Wittgenstein</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein</strong> (;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> ; 26 April 1889 – 29 April 1951) was an Austrian-British philosopher who worked primarily in <a class="uri" href="logic" title="wikilink">logic</a>, the <a href="philosophy_of_mathematics" title="wikilink">philosophy of mathematics</a>, the <a href="philosophy_of_mind" title="wikilink">philosophy of mind</a>, and the <a href="philosophy_of_language" title="wikilink">philosophy of language</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> From 1929–1947, Wittgenstein taught at the <a href="University_of_Cambridge" title="wikilink">University of Cambridge</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> During his lifetime he published just one slim book, the 75-page <em><a href="Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus" title="wikilink">Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</a></em> (1921), one article, one book review and a children's dictionary.<ref>For his publications during his lifetime, see <a href="Ray_Monk" title="wikilink">Monk, R.</a>, <em>How to read Wittgenstein</em>.

His voluminous manuscripts were edited and published posthumously. <em><a href="Philosophical_Investigations" title="wikilink">Philosophical Investigations</a></em> appeared as a book in 1953 and by the end of the century it was considered an important modern classic.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Philosopher <a href="Bertrand_Russell" title="wikilink">Bertrand Russell</a> described Wittgenstein as "the most perfect example I have ever known of genius as traditionally conceived; passionate, profound, intense, and dominating".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></li>

<p>Born in <a class="uri" href="Vienna" title="wikilink">Vienna</a> into one of Europe's richest families, he inherited a large fortune from his father in 1913. He gave some considerable sums to poor artists. In a period of severe personal depression after the first World War, he then gave away his entire fortune to his brothers and sisters.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><ref>Duffy, Bruce.

</ul>

<p>His philosophy is often divided into an early period, exemplified by the <em>Tractatus</em>, and a later period, articulated in the <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>. The early Wittgenstein was concerned with the logical relationship between propositions and the world and believed that by providing an account of the logic underlying this relationship, he had solved all philosophical problems. The later Wittgenstein rejected many of the assumptions of the <em>Tractatus</em>, arguing that the meaning of words is best understood as their use within a given <a class="uri" href="language-game" title="wikilink">language-game</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>Wittgenstein's influence has been felt in nearly every field of the humanities and social sciences, yet there are diverging interpretations of his thought. In the words of his friend and colleague <a href="Georg_Henrik_von_Wright" title="wikilink">Georg Henrik von Wright</a>:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>He was of the opinion... that his ideas were generally misunderstood and distorted even by those who professed to be his disciples. He doubted he would be better understood in the future. He once said he felt as though he was writing for people who would think in a different way, breathe a different air of life, from that of present-day men.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p> According to a family tree prepared in Jerusalem after World War II, Wittgenstein's paternal great-grandfather was Moses Meier, a <a href="Ashkenazi_Jews" title="wikilink">Jewish</a> land agent who lived with his wife, Brendel Simon, in <a href="Bad_Laasphe" title="wikilink">Bad Laasphe</a> in the <a href="Siegen-Wittgenstein" title="wikilink">Principality of Wittgenstein</a>, Westphalia.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In July 1808, <a class="uri" href="Napoleon" title="wikilink">Napoleon</a> issued a decree that everyone, including Jews, must adopt an inheritable <a href="Jewish_surname" title="wikilink">family surname</a>, and so Meier's son, also Moses, took the name of his employers, the <a href="Sayn-Wittgenstein" title="wikilink">Sayn-Wittgensteins</a>, and became Moses Meier Wittgenstein.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> His son, Hermann Christian Wittgenstein—who took the middle name "Christian" to distance himself from his Jewish background—married Fanny Figdor, also Jewish, who converted to Protestantism just before they married, and the couple founded a successful business trading in wool in Leipzig.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Ludwig's grandmother Fanny was a first cousin of the famous violinist <a href="Joseph_Joachim" title="wikilink">Joseph Joachim</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> They had 11 children—among them Wittgenstein's father. Karl Wittgenstein (1847–1913) became an industrial tycoon, and by the late 1880s was one of the richest men in Europe, with an effective monopoly on Austria's steel cartel.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Thanks to Karl, the Wittgensteins became the second wealthiest family in <a class="uri" href="Austria-Hungary" title="wikilink">Austria-Hungary</a>, behind only the <a href="Rothschild_family" title="wikilink">Rothschilds</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> As a result of his decision in 1898 to invest substantially in the Netherlands and in Switzerland as well as overseas, particularly in the US, the family was to an extent shielded from the hyperinflation that hit Austria in 1922.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> However, their wealth diminished due to post-1918 hyperinflation and subsequently during the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a>, although even as late as 1938 they owned 13 mansions in Vienna alone.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<li>For his time and place of birth, see Edmonds, David and Eidinow, John. <em>Wittgenstein's Poker</em>. Faber and Faber, 2001, p. 57. Karl and Poldi had nine children in all. There were four girls: Hermine, <a href="Margaret_Stonborough-Wittgenstein" title="wikilink">Margaret</a> (Gretl), Helene, and a fourth daughter who died as a baby; and five boys: Johannes (Hans), Kurt, Rudolf (Rudi), <a href="Paul_Wittgenstein" title="wikilink">Paul</a>—who became a concert pianist despite losing an arm in <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>—and Ludwig, who was the youngest of the family.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>The children were baptized as Catholics, received formal Catholic instruction, and raised in an exceptionally intense environment.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The family was at the center of Vienna's cultural life; <a href="Bruno_Walter" title="wikilink">Bruno Walter</a> described the life at the Wittgensteins' palace as an "all-pervading atmosphere of humanity and culture".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Karl was a leading patron of the arts, commissioning works by <a href="Auguste_Rodin" title="wikilink">Auguste Rodin</a> and financing the city's exhibition hall and art gallery, the <a href="Secession_hall_(Austria)" title="wikilink">Secession Building</a>. <a href="Gustav_Klimt" title="wikilink">Gustav Klimt</a> painted Wittgenstein's sister for her wedding portrait, and <a href="Johannes_Brahms" title="wikilink">Johannes Brahms</a> and <a href="Gustav_Mahler" title="wikilink">Gustav Mahler</a> gave regular concerts in the family's numerous music rooms.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>For Wittgenstein, who highly valued precision and discipline, <a href="contemporary_music" title="wikilink">contemporary music</a> was never considered acceptable at all. "Music", he said to his friend Drury in 1930, "came to a full stop with Brahms; and even in Brahms I can begin to hear the noise of machinery."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Wittgenstein himself had <a href="absolute_pitch" title="wikilink">absolute pitch</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> and his devotion to music remained vitally important to him throughout his life: he made frequent use of musical examples and metaphors in his philosophical writings, and was unusually adept at whistling lengthy and detailed musical passages.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> He also learnt to play the <a class="uri" href="clarinet" title="wikilink">clarinet</a> in his thirties.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> A fragment of music (three bars), composed by Wittgenstein, was discovered in one of his 1931 notebooks, by Dr Michael Nedo, Director of the Wittgenstein Institute in Cambridge.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p> The family Palais housed seven grand pianos<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> and each of the siblings pursued music "with an enthusiasm that, at times, bordered on the pathological".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The eldest brother, Hans, was hailed as a musical prodigy.

<p>The second eldest brother, Kurt, an officer and company director, shot himself on 27 October 1918 at the end of World War I, when the Austrian troops he was commanding refused to obey his orders and deserted <em>en masse</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> According to Gottlieb, Hermine had said Kurt seemed to carry "the germ of disgust for life within himself".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Later Wittgenstein wrote: "I ought to have... become a star in the sky.

<p> Wittgenstein was taught by private tutors at home until he was fourteen years old. Subsequently, for three years, he attended a school. After the deaths of Hans and Rudi, Karl relented, and allowed Paul and Ludwig to be sent to school. Waugh writes that it was too late for Wittgenstein to pass his exams for the more academic <a href="Gymnasium_(school)" title="wikilink">Gymnasium</a> in Wiener Neustadt; having had no formal schooling, he failed his entrance exam and only barely managed after extra tutoring to pass the exam for the more technically oriented <a class="uri" href="K.u.k." title="wikilink">K.u.k.</a> <a class="uri" href="Realschule" title="wikilink">Realschule</a> in <a class="uri" href="Linz" title="wikilink">Linz</a>, a small state school with 300 pupils.<ref name="Waugh33">Waugh, p. 33.</ref></p>

<p>On starting at the Realschule, Wittgenstein had been moved forward a year.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Historian <a href="Brigitte_Hamann" title="wikilink">Brigitte Hamann</a> writes that he stood out from the other boys: he spoke an unusually pure form of <a href="High_German" title="wikilink">High German</a> with a stutter, dressed elegantly, and was sensitive and unsociable.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Monk writes that the other boys made fun of him, singing after him: "<em>Wittgenstein wandelt wehmütig widriger Winde wegen Wienwärts</em>"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> ("Wittgenstein strolls wistfully Vienna-wards due to adverse winds"). In his leaving certificate, he received a top mark (5) in religious studies; a 2 for conduct and English, 3 for French, geography, history, mathematics and physics, and 4 for German, chemistry, geometry and freehand drawing.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> He had particular difficulty with spelling and failed his written German exam because of it. He wrote in 1931: "My bad spelling in youth, up to the age of about 18 or 19, is connected with the whole of the rest of my character (my weakness in study)."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="faith">Faith</h3>

<p>Wittgenstein was baptized as an infant by a Catholic priest and received formal instruction in Catholic doctrine as a child.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> It was while he was at the <em>Realschule</em> that he decided he had lost his faith in God.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> He nevertheless believed in the importance of the idea of confession. He wrote in his diaries about having made a major confession to his oldest sister, Hermine, while he was at the <em>Realschule</em>; Monk writes that it may have been about his loss of faith. He also discussed it with Gretl, his other sister, who directed him to <a href="Arthur_Schopenhauer" title="wikilink">Arthur Schopenhauer</a>'s <em><a href="The_World_as_Will_and_Representation" title="wikilink">The World as Will and Representation</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> As a teenager, Wittgenstein adopted Schopenhauer's epistemological idealism. However, after his study of the philosophy of mathematics, he abandoned epistemological idealism for <a href="Gottlob_Frege" title="wikilink">Gottlob Frege</a>'s conceptual realism.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> In later years, Wittgenstein was highly dismissive of Schopenhauer, describing him as an ultimately "shallow" thinker: "Schopenhauer has quite a crude mind... where real depth starts, his comes to an end".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p>Wittgenstein's faith would undergo developmental transformations over time, much like his philosophical ideas; his relationship with Christianity and religion, in general, for which he professed a sincere and devoted reverence, would eventually flourish. Undoubtedly, amongst other Christian thinkers, Wittgenstein was influenced by <a href="St._Augustine" title="wikilink">St. Augustine</a>, with whom he would occasionally converse in his <em>Philosophical Investigations.</em> Philosophically, Wittgenstein's thought shows fundamental alignment with religious discourse.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> For example, Wittgenstein would become one of the century's fiercest critics of <a class="uri" href="Scientism" title="wikilink">Scientism</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

<p>With age, his deepening Christianity led to many religious elucidations and clarifications, as he untangled language problems in religion, attacking, for example, the temptation to think of God's existence as a matter of scientific evidence.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> In 1947, finding it more difficult to work, he wrote, "I have had a letter from an old friend in Austria, a priest. In it he says that he hopes my work will go well, if it should be God's will. Now that is all I want: if it should be God's will." <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> In Wittgenstein's <em>Culture and Value</em>, it is found, "Is what I am doing [my work in philosophy] really worth the effort? Yes, but only if a light shines on it from above." His close friend Norman Malcolm would write, “Wittgenstein’s mature life was strongly marked by religious thought and feeling. I am inclined to think that he was more deeply religious than are many people who correctly regard themselves as religious believers.” <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> At last, Wittgenstein writes, "Bach wrote on the title page of his <em>Orgelbuechlein</em>, ‘To the glory of the most high God, and that my neighbour may be benefited thereby.’ That is what I would have liked to say about my work.” <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="influence-of-otto-weininger">Influence of Otto Weininger</h3>

<p> While a student at the <em>Realschule</em>, Wittgenstein was influenced by Austrian philosopher <a href="Otto_Weininger" title="wikilink">Otto Weininger</a>'s 1903 book <em>Geschlecht und Charakter</em> (<a href="Sex_and_Character" title="wikilink">Sex and Character</a>). Weininger (1880–1903), who was also Jewish, argued that the concepts male and female exist only as <a href="Platonic_realism" title="wikilink">Platonic forms</a>, and that Jews tend to embody the platonic femininity. Whereas men are basically rational, women operate only at the level of their emotions and sexual organs. Jews, Weininger argued, are similar, saturated with femininity, with no sense of right and wrong, and no soul. Weininger argues that man must choose between his masculine and feminine sides, consciousness and unconsciousness, Platonic love and sexuality. Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality. The only life worth living is the spiritual one—to live as a woman or a Jew means one has no right to live at all; the choice is genius or death. Weininger committed suicide, shooting himself in 1903, shortly after publishing the book.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Many years later, as a professor at Cambridge, Wittgenstein distributed copies of Weininger's book to his bemused academic colleagues.

<h3 id="jewish-background-and-hitler">Jewish background and Hitler</h3>

<p>There is much debate about the extent to which Wittgenstein and his siblings, who were of 3/4 Jewish descent, saw themselves as Jews, and the issue has arisen in particular regarding Wittgenstein's schooldays, because <a href="Adolf_Hitler" title="wikilink">Adolf Hitler</a> was at the same school for part of the same time.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> <a href="Laurence_Goldstein" title="wikilink">Laurence Goldstein</a> argues it is "overwhelmingly probable" the boys met each other: that Hitler would have disliked Wittgenstein, a "stammering, precocious, precious, aristocratic upstart ...".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Other commentators have dismissed as irresponsible and uninformed any suggestion that Wittgenstein's wealth and unusual personality may have fed Hitler's antisemitism, in part because there is no indication that Hitler would have seen Wittgenstein as Jewish.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>

<p>In his own writings<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Wittgenstein frequently referred to himself as Jewish, at times as part of an apparent self-flagellation. For example, while berating himself for being a "reproductive" as opposed to "productive" thinker, he attributed this to his own Jewish sense of identity, writing: "The saint is the only Jewish genius. Even the greatest Jewish thinker is no more than talented. (Myself for instance)."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> While Wittgenstein would later claim that "[m]y thoughts are 100% Hebraic",<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> as <a href="Hans_Sluga" title="wikilink">Hans Sluga</a> has argued, if so, "his was a self-doubting Judaism, which had always the possibility of collapsing into a destructive self-hatred (as it did in <a href="Otto_Weininger" title="wikilink">Weininger's</a> case) but which also held an immense promise of innovation and genius."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="university">1906–1913: University</h2>
<h3 id="engineering-at-berlin-and-manchester">Engineering at Berlin and Manchester</h3>

<p> He began his studies in mechanical engineering at the <a href="Berlin_Institute_of_Technology" title="wikilink">Technische Hochschule</a> in <a class="uri" href="Charlottenburg" title="wikilink">Charlottenburg</a>, Berlin, on 23 October 1906, lodging with the family of professor Dr. Jolles. He attended for three semesters, and was awarded a diploma on 5 May 1908. During his time at the Institute, Wittgenstein developed an interest in aeronautics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> He arrived at the <a href="Victoria_University_of_Manchester" title="wikilink">Victoria University of Manchester</a> in the spring of 1908 to do his doctorate, full of plans for aeronautical projects, including designing and flying his own plane. He conducted research into the behavior of kites in the upper atmosphere, experimenting at a meteorological observation site near Glossop.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> He also worked on the design of a propeller with small jet engines on the end of its blades, something he patented in 1911 and which earned him a research studentship from the university in the autumn of 1908.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> </p>

<p>It was at this time that he became interested in the <a href="foundations_of_mathematics" title="wikilink">foundations of mathematics</a>, particularly after reading <a href="Bertrand_Russell" title="wikilink">Bertrand Russell</a>'s <em><a href="The_Principles_of_Mathematics" title="wikilink">The Principles of Mathematics</a></em> (1903), and <a href="Gottlob_Frege" title="wikilink">Gottlob Frege</a>'s <em>Grundgesetze der Arithmetik</em>, vol. 1 (1893) and vol. 2 (1903).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Wittgenstein's sister Hermine said he became obsessed with mathematics as a result, and was anyway losing interest in aeronautics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> He decided instead that he needed to study logic and the foundations of mathematics, describing himself as in a "constant, indescribable, almost pathological state of agitation".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn74" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> In the summer of 1911 he visited Frege at the <a href="University_of_Jena" title="wikilink">University of Jena</a> to show him some philosophy of mathematics and logic he had written, and to ask whether it was worth pursuing.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn75" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> He wrote: "I was shown into Frege's study. Frege was a small, neat man with a pointed beard who bounced around the room as he talked. He absolutely wiped the floor with me, and I felt very depressed; but at the end he said 'You must come again', so I cheered up. I had several discussions with him after that. Frege would never talk about anything but logic and mathematics, if I started on some other subject, he would say something polite and then plunge back into logic and mathematics."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn76" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="arrival-at-cambridge">Arrival at Cambridge</h3>

<p> Wittgenstein wanted to study with Frege, but Frege suggested he attend the University of Cambridge to study under Russell, so on 18 October 1911 Wittgenstein arrived unannounced at Russell's rooms in <a href="Trinity_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Trinity College</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn77" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Russell was having tea with <a href="C._K._Ogden" title="wikilink">C. K. Ogden</a>, when, according to Russell, "an unknown German appeared, speaking very little English but refusing to speak German. He turned out to be a man who had learned engineering at Charlottenburg, but during this course had acquired, by himself, a passion for the philosophy of mathematics &amp; has now come to Cambridge on purpose to hear me."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn78" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> He was soon not only attending Russell's lectures, but dominating them. The lectures were poorly attended and Russell often found himself lecturing only to <a href="C._D._Broad" title="wikilink">C. D. Broad</a>, <a href="Eric_Harold_Neville" title="wikilink">E. H. Neville</a>, and H. T. J. Norton.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn79" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Wittgenstein started following him after lectures back to his rooms to discuss more philosophy, until it was time for the evening meal in <a href="Formal_(university)#Terminology" title="wikilink">Hall</a>. Russell grew irritated; he wrote to his lover <a href="Lady_Ottoline_Morrell" title="wikilink">Lady Ottoline Morrell</a>: "My German friend threatens to be an infliction."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn80" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>

<p>Russell soon came to believe that Wittgenstein was a genius, especially after he had examined Wittgenstein's written work. He wrote in November 1911 that he had at first thought Wittgenstein might be a crank, but soon decided he was a genius: "Some of his early views made the decision difficult. He maintained, for example, at one time that all existential propositions are meaningless. This was in a lecture room, and I invited him to consider the proposition: 'There is no hippopotamus in this room at present.' When he refused to believe this, I looked under all the desks without finding one; but he remained unconvinced."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn81" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Three months after Wittgenstein's arrival Russell told Morrell: "I love him &amp; feel he will solve the problems I am too old to solve ... He is <em>the</em> young man one hopes for."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn82" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> The role-reversal between him and Wittgenstein was such that he wrote in 1916, after Wittgenstein had criticized his own work: "His criticism, 'tho I don't think he realized it at the time, was an event of first-rate importance in my life, and affected everything I have done since. I saw that he was right, and I saw that I could not hope ever again to do fundamental work in philosophy."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn83" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1912 Wittgenstein joined the <a href="Cambridge_University_Moral_Sciences_Club" title="wikilink">Cambridge Moral Sciences Club</a>, an influential discussion group for philosophy dons and students, delivering his first paper there on 29 November that year, a four-minute talk defining philosophy as "all those primitive propositions which are assumed as true without proof by the various sciences."<ref>Pitt, Jack.

<p>The club became infamous within popular philosophy because of a meeting on 25 October 1946 at <a href="R._B._Braithwaite" title="wikilink">Richard Braithwaite</a>'s rooms in <a href="King's_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">King's</a>, where <a href="Karl_Popper" title="wikilink">Karl Popper</a>, another Viennese philosopher, had been invited as the guest speaker. Popper's paper was "Are there philosophical problems?", in which he struck up a position against Wittgenstein's, contending that problems in philosophy are real, not just linguistic puzzles as Wittgenstein argued. Accounts vary as to what happened next, but Wittgenstein apparently started waving a hot poker, demanding that Popper give him an example of a moral rule. Popper offered one—"Not to threaten visiting speakers with pokers"—at which point Russell told Wittgenstein he had misunderstood and Wittgenstein left. Popper maintained that Wittgenstein 'stormed out', but it had become accepted practice for him to leave early (because of his aforementioned ability to dominate discussion). It was the only time the philosophers, three of the most eminent in the world, were ever in the same room together.<ref>Eidinow, John and Edmonds, David. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/mar/31/artsandhumanities.highereducation">"When Ludwig met Karl..."</a>, <em>The Guardian</em>, 31 March 2001.</ref></p>

<p><a href="John_Maynard_Keynes" title="wikilink">John Maynard Keynes</a> also invited him to join the <a href="Cambridge_Apostles" title="wikilink">Cambridge Apostles</a>, an elite secret society formed in 1820, which both Russell and <a href="G._E._Moore" title="wikilink">G. E. Moore</a> had joined as students, but Wittgenstein did not enjoy it and attended infrequently. Russell had been worried that Wittgenstein would not appreciate the group's unseriousness, style of humour, or the fact that the members were in love with one another.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn86" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> He was admitted in 1912 but resigned almost immediately because he could not tolerate the level of the discussion on the Hearth Rug; they took him back though in the 1920s when he returned to Cambridge. (He also had trouble tolerating the discussions in the Moral Sciences Club.)</p>
<h3 id="sexual-orientation-and-relationship-with-david-pinsent">Sexual orientation and relationship with David Pinsent</h3>

<p>Wittgenstein had romantic relations with both men and women. He is generally believed to have fallen in love with at least three men: <a href="David_Pinsent" title="wikilink">David Hume Pinsent</a> in 1912, <a href="Francis_Skinner" title="wikilink">Francis Skinner</a> in 1930, and Ben Richards in the late 1940s.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn87" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> He later revealed that, as a teenager in Vienna, he had had an affair with a woman.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn88" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Additionally, in the 1920s Wittgenstein became infatuated with a young Swiss woman, Marguerite Respinger, modelling a sculpture of her and proposing marriage, albeit on condition that they did not have children.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn89" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>

<p>Wittgenstein's <a href="Platonic_love" title="wikilink">platonic relationship</a> with David Pinsent (1891–1918) occurred during an intellectually formative period, and is well documented. Bertrand Russell introduced Wittgenstein to Pinsent in the summer of 1912. A mathematics undergraduate and descendant of <a href="David_Hume" title="wikilink">David Hume</a>, Pinsent soon became Wittgenstein's closest friend.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn90" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> The men worked together on experiments in the psychology laboratory about the role of rhythm in the appreciation of music, and Wittgenstein delivered a paper on the subject to the <a href="British_Psychological_Society" title="wikilink">British Psychological Association</a> in Cambridge in 1912. They also travelled together, including to Iceland in September 1912—the expenses paid by Wittgenstein, including <a href="first_class_travel" title="wikilink">first class travel</a>, the hiring of a private train, and new clothes and spending money for Pinsent—and later to Norway. Pinsent's diaries provide valuable insights into Wittgenstein's personality - sensitive, nervous and attuned to the tiniest slight or change in mood from Pinsent.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn91" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> In his diaries Pinsent wrote about shopping for furniture with Wittgenstein in Cambridge when the latter was given rooms in Trinity; most of what they found in the stores was not minimalist enough for Wittgenstein's aesthetics: "I went and helped him interview a lot of furniture at various shops ... It was rather amusing: he is terribly fastidious and we led the shopman a frightful dance, Vittgenstein [sic] ejaculating "No—Beastly!" to 90 percent of what he shewed [archaic spelling] us!"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn92" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>

<p>He wrote in May 1912 that Wittgenstein had just begun to study the history of philosophy: "He expresses the most naive surprise that all the philosophers he once worshipped in ignorance are after all stupid and dishonest and make disgusting mistakes!"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn93" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> The last time they saw each other was at a Birmingham railway station on 8 October 1913, when they said goodbye before Wittgenstein left to live in Norway.</p>

<h3 id="work-on-logik">Work on <em>Logik</em></h3>

<p> Karl Wittgenstein died on 20 January 1913, and after receiving his inheritance Wittgenstein became one of the wealthiest men in Europe.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn94" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> He donated some of his money, at first anonymously, to Austrian artists and writers, including <a href="Rainer_Maria_Rilke" title="wikilink">Rainer Maria Rilke</a> and <a href="Georg_Trakl" title="wikilink">Georg Trakl</a>. Wittgenstein came to feel that he could not get to the heart of his most fundamental questions while surrounded by other academics, and so in 1913 he retreated to the village of <a class="uri" href="Skjolden" title="wikilink">Skjolden</a> in Norway, where he rented the second floor of a house for the winter. He later saw this as one of the most productive periods of his life, writing <em>Logik</em> (<em>Notes on Logic</em>), the predecessor of much of the <em>Tractatus</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn95" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> While in Norway, Wittgenstein learned <a href="Norwegian_language" title="wikilink">Norwegian</a> to converse with the local villagers, and <a href="Danish_language" title="wikilink">Danish</a> to read the works of the Danish philosopher <a href="Søren_Kierkegaard" title="wikilink">Søren Kierkegaard</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn96" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>

<p>At Wittgenstein's insistence, Moore, who was now a Cambridge don, visited him in Norway in 1914, reluctantly because Wittgenstein exhausted him. David Edmonds and John Eidinow write that Wittgenstein regarded Moore, an internationally-known philosopher, as an example of how far someone could get in life with "absolutely no intelligence whatever".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn97" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> In Norway it was clear that Moore was expected to act as Wittgenstein's secretary, taking down his notes, with Wittgenstein falling into a rage when Moore got something wrong.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn98" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> When he returned to Cambridge, Moore asked the university to consider accepting <em>Logik</em> as sufficient for a bachelor's degree, but they refused, saying it wasn't formatted properly: no footnotes, no preface. Wittgenstein was furious, writing to Moore in May 1914: "If I am not worth your making an exception for me <em>even in some STUPID details</em> then I may as well go to Hell directly; and if I <em>am</em> worth it and you don't do it then—by God—<em>you</em> might go there."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn99" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> Moore was apparently distraught; he wrote in his diary that he felt sick and could not get the letter out of his head.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn100" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> The two did not speak again until 1929.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn101" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>

<p>Throughout the war, he kept notebooks in which he frequently wrote philosophical reflections alongside personal remarks, including his contempt for the character of the other soldiers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn111" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> He discovered <a href="Leo_Tolstoy" title="wikilink">Leo Tolstoy</a>'s 1896 <em><a href="The_Gospel_in_Brief" title="wikilink">The Gospel in Brief</a></em> at a bookshop in <a class="uri" href="Tarnów" title="wikilink">Tarnów</a>, and carried it everywhere, recommending it to anyone in distress, to the point where he became known to his fellow soldiers as "the man with the gospels".<ref>Monk, pp. 44, 116, 382–384.</ref></p>

<h3 id="completion-of-the-tractatus">Completion of the <em>Tractatus</em></h3>

<p>In the summer of 1918 Wittgenstein took military leave and went to stay in one of his family's Vienna summer houses, Neuwaldegg. It was there in August 1918 that he completed the <em>Tractatus</em>, which he submitted with the title <em>Der Satz</em> (German: proposition, sentence, phrase, set, but also "leap") to the publishers Jahoda and Siegel.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn114" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a></p>

<p>A series of events around this time left him deeply upset. On 13 August, his uncle Paul died. On 25 October, he learned that Jahoda and Siegel had decided not to publish the <em>Tractatus</em>, and on 27 October, his brother Kurt killed himself, the third of his brothers to commit suicide. It was around this time he received a letter from David Pinsent's mother to say that Pinsent had been killed in a plane crash on 8 May.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn115" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> Wittgenstein was distraught to the point of being suicidal. He was sent back to the Italian front after his leave and, as a result of the defeat of the Austrian army, was captured by <a href="Allies_of_World_War_I" title="wikilink">Allied forces</a> on 3 November in <a class="uri" href="Trentino" title="wikilink">Trentino</a>. He subsequently spent nine months in an Italian prisoner of war camp.</p>

<p>He returned to his family in Vienna on 25 August 1919, by all accounts physically and mentally spent. He apparently talked incessantly about suicide, terrifying his sisters and brother Paul. He decided to do two things: to enroll in teacher training college as an elementary school teacher, and to get rid of his fortune. In 1914, it had been providing him with an income of 300,000 <a href="Austro-Hungarian_krone" title="wikilink">Kronen</a> a year, but by 1919 was worth a great deal more, with a sizable portfolio of investments in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> and the <a class="uri" href="Netherlands" title="wikilink">Netherlands</a>. He divided it among his siblings, except for Margarete, insisting that it not be held in trust for him. His family saw him as ill, and acquiesced.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn116" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>

<p>In September 1919 he enrolled in the <em>Lehrerbildungsanstalt</em> (teacher training college) in the <em>Kundmanngasse</em> in Vienna. His sister Hermine said that Wittgenstein working as an elementary teacher was like using a precision instrument to open crates, but the family decided not to interfere.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn117" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> <a href="Thomas_Bernhard" title="wikilink">Thomas Bernhard</a>, more critically, wrote of this period in Wittgenstein's life: "the multi-millionaire as a village schoolmaster is surely a piece of perversity."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn118" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="teaching-posts-in-austria">Teaching posts in Austria</h3>

<p>In the summer of 1920, Wittgenstein worked as a gardener for a monastery. At first he applied, under a false name, for a teaching post at Reichenau, was awarded the job, but he declined it when his identity was discovered. As a teacher, he wished to no longer be recognized as a member of the famous Wittgenstein family. In response, his brother Paul wrote:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>"It is out of the question, really completely out of the question, that anybody bearing our name and whose elegant and gentle upbringing can be seen a thousand paces off, would not be identified as a member of our family... That one can neither simulate nor dissimulate anything including a refined education I need hardly tell you."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn119" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1920, Wittgenstein was given his first job as a primary school teacher in <a class="uri" href="Trattenbach" title="wikilink">Trattenbach</a>, under his real name, in a remote village of a few hundred people. His first letters describe it as beautiful, but in October 1921, he wrote to Russell: "I am still at Trattenbach, surrounded, as ever, by odiousness and baseness. I know that human beings on the average are not worth much anywhere, but here they are much more good-for-nothing and irresponsible than elsewhere."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn120" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> He was soon the object of gossip among the villagers, who found him eccentric at best. He did not get on well with the other teachers; when he found his lodgings too noisy, he made a bed for himself in the school kitchen. He was an enthusiastic teacher, offering late-night extra tuition to several of the students, something that did not endear him to the parents, though some of them came to adore him; his sister Hermine occasionally watched him teach and said the students "literally crawled over each other in their desire to be chosen for answers or demonstrations".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn121" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>

<p>To the less able, it seems that he became something of a tyrant. The first two hours of each day were devoted to mathematics, hours that Monk writes some of the pupils recalled years later with horror.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn122" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> They reported that he caned the boys and boxed their ears, and also that he pulled the girls' hair;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn123" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> This was not unusual at the time for boys, but for the villagers he went too far in doing it to the girls too; girls were not expected to understand algebra, much less have their ears boxed over it. The violence apart, Monk writes that he quickly became a village legend, shouting "<em>Krautsalat!</em>" ("coleslaw" - i.e. shredded cabbage) when the headmaster played the piano, and "Nonsense!" when a priest was answering children's questions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn124" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>

<p>While Wittgenstein was living in isolation in rural Austria, the <em><a href="Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus" title="wikilink">Tractatus</a></em> was published to considerable interest, first in German in 1921 as <em>Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung</em>, part of <a href="Wilhelm_Ostwald" title="wikilink">Wilhelm Ostwald</a>'s journal <em>Annalen der Naturphilosophie</em>, though Wittgenstein was not happy with the result and called it a pirate edition. Russell had agreed to write an introduction to explain why it was important, because it was otherwise unlikely to have been published: it was difficult if not impossible to understand, and Wittgenstein was unknown in philosophy.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn125" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> In a letter to Russell, Wittgenstein wrote "The main point is the theory of what can be expressed (gesagt) by prop[osition]s—i.e. by language—(and, which comes to the same thing, what can be <em>thought</em>) and what can not be expressed by pro[position]s, but only shown (gezeigt); which, I believe, is the cardinal problem of philosophy."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn126" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> But Wittgenstein was not happy with Russell's help. He had lost faith in Russell, finding him glib and his philosophy mechanistic, and felt he had fundamentally misunderstood the <em>Tractatus</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn127" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>

<p>An English translation was prepared in Cambridge by <a href="Frank_P._Ramsey" title="wikilink">Frank Ramsey</a>, a mathematics undergraduate at King's commissioned by <a href="C._K._Ogden" title="wikilink">C. K. Ogden</a>. It was Moore who suggested <em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em> for the title, an allusion to <a href="Baruch_Spinoza" title="wikilink">Baruch Spinoza</a>'s <em>Tractatus Theologico-Politicus.</em> Initially there were difficulties in finding a publisher for the English edition too, because Wittgenstein was insisting it appear without Russell's introduction; Cambridge University Press turned it down for that reason. Finally in 1922 an agreement was reached with Wittgenstein that Kegan Paul would print a bilingual edition with Russell's introduction and the Ramsey-Ogden translation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn128" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> This is the translation that was approved by Wittgenstein, but it is problematic in a number of ways. Wittgenstein's English was poor at the time, and Ramsey was a teenager who had only recently learned German, so philosophers often prefer to use a 1961 translation by <a href="David_Pears" title="wikilink">David Pears</a> and Brian McGuinness.<ref>For example, Ramsey translated "<em>Sachverhalt</em>" and "<em>Sachlage</em>" as "atomic fact" and "state of affairs" respectively. But Wittgenstein discusses non-existent "<em>Sachverhalten</em>", and there cannot be a non-existent fact. Pears and McGuinness made a number of changes, including translating "<em>Sachverhalt</em>" as "state of affairs" and "<em>Sachlage</em>" as "situation". The new translation is often preferred, but some philosophers use the original, in part because Wittgenstein approved it, and because it avoids the idiomatic English of Pears-McGuinness.

<p>An aim of the <em>Tractatus</em> is to reveal the relationship between language and the world: what can be said about it, and what can only be shown. Wittgenstein argues that language has an underlying logical structure, a structure that provides the limits of what can be said meaningfully, and therefore the limits of what can be thought. The limits of language, for Wittgenstein, are the limits of philosophy. Much of philosophy involves attempts to say the unsayable: "what we can say at all can be said clearly", he argues. Anything beyond that—religion, ethics, aesthetics, the mystical—cannot be discussed. They are not in themselves nonsensical, but any statement about them must be.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn129" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> He wrote in the preface: "The book will, therefore, draw a limit to thinking, or rather—not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts; for, in order to draw a limit to thinking we should have to be able to think both sides of this limit (we should therefore have to be able to think what cannot be thought)."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn130" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a></p>

<p>The book is 75 pages long—"As to the shortness of the book, I am <em>awfully sorry for it</em> ... If you were to squeeze me like a lemon you would get nothing more out of me", he told Ogden—and presents seven numbered propositions (1–7), with various sub-levels (1, 1.1, 1.11):<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn131" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>

<p> In September 1922 he moved to a secondary school in a nearby village, Hassbach, but the people there were just as bad—"These people are not human <em>at all</em> but loathsome worms", he wrote to a friend—and he left after a month. In November he began work at another primary school, this time in <a href="Puchberg_am_Schneeberg" title="wikilink">Puchberg</a> in the <a href="Schneeberg_(Alps)" title="wikilink">Schneeberg</a> mountains. There, he told Russell, the villagers were "one-quarter animal and three-quarters human".</p>

<p><a href="Frank_P._Ramsey" title="wikilink">Frank P. Ramsey</a> visited him on 17 September 1923 to discuss the <em>Tractatus</em>; he had agreed to write a review of it for <em>Mind</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn133" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> He reported in a letter home that Wittgenstein was living frugally in one tiny whitewashed room that only had space for a bed, washstand, a small table, and one small hard chair. Ramsey shared an evening meal with him of coarse bread, butter, and cocoa. Wittgenstein's school hours were eight to twelve or one, and he had afternoons free.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn134" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> After Ramsey returned to Cambridge a long campaign began among Wittgenstein's friends to persuade him to return to Cambridge and away from what they saw as a hostile environment for him. He was accepting no help even from his family.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn135" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> Ramsey wrote to John Maynard Keynes:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>"[Wittgenstein's family] are very rich and extremely anxious to give him money or do anything for him in any way, and he rejects all their advances; even Christmas presents or presents of invalid's food, when he is ill, he sends back. And this is not because they aren't on good terms but because he won't have any money he hasn't earned ...

<h3 id="haidbauer-incident-otterthal">Haidbauer incident, Otterthal</h3>

<p>He moved schools again in September 1924, this time to <a class="uri" href="Otterthal" title="wikilink">Otterthal</a>, near Trattenbach; the socialist headmaster, Josef Putre, was someone Wittgenstein had become friends with while at Trattenbach. While he was there, he wrote a 42-page pronunciation and spelling dictionary for the children, <em>Wörterbuch für Volksschulen</em>, published in Vienna in 1926 by Hölder-Pichler-Tempsky, the only book of his apart from the <em>Tractatus</em> that was published in his lifetime.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn137" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> A first edition sold in 2005 for £75,000.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn138" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>

<p>An incident occurred in April 1926 and became known as <em>Der Vorfall Haidbauer</em> (the Haidbauer incident). Josef Haidbauer was an 11-year-old pupil whose father had died and whose mother worked as a local maid. He was a slow learner, and one day Wittgenstein hit him two or three times on the head, causing him to collapse. Wittgenstein carried him to the headmaster's office, then quickly left the school, bumping into a parent, Herr Piribauer, on the way out. Piribauer had been sent for by the children when they saw Haidbauer collapse; Wittgenstein had previously pulled Piribauer's daughter, Hermine, so hard by the ears that her ears had bled.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn139" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> Piribauer said that when he met Wittgenstein in the hall that day: "I called him all the names under the sun. I told him he wasn't a teacher, he was an animal-trainer! And that I was going to fetch the police right away!"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn140" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>

<p>Piribauer tried to have Wittgenstein arrested, but the village's police station was empty, and when he tried again the next day he was told Wittgenstein had disappeared. On 28 April 1926, Wittgenstein handed in his resignation to Wilhelm Kundt, a local school inspector, who tried to persuade him to stay; however, Wittgenstein was adamant that his days as a schoolteacher were over.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn141" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> Proceedings were initiated in May, and the judge ordered a psychiatric report; in August 1926 a letter to Wittgenstein from a friend, Ludwig Hänsel, indicates that hearings were ongoing, but nothing is known about the case after that. Alexander Waugh writes that Wittgenstein's family and their money may have had a hand in covering things up. Waugh writes that Haidbauer died shortly afterwards of haemophilia; Monk says he died when he was 14 of leukaemia.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn142" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a></p>

<p>Ten years later, in 1936, as part of a series of "confessions" he engaged in that year, Wittgenstein appeared without warning at the village saying he wanted to confess personally and ask for pardon from the children he had hit. He visited at least four of the children, including Hermine Piribauer, who apparently replied only with a "Ja, ja", though other former students were more hospitable. Monk writes that the purpose of these confessions was not "to hurt his pride, as a form of punishment; it was to dismantle it – to remove a barrier, as it were, that stood in the way of honest and decent thought." Of the apologies, Wittgenstein wrote, "This brought me into more settled waters... and to greater seriousness."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn143" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-vienna-circle">The Vienna Circle</h3>

<p>The <em>Tractatus</em> was now the subject of much debate amongst philosophers, and Wittgenstein was a figure of increasing international fame. In particular, a discussion group of philosophers, scientists and mathematicians, known as the <a href="Vienna_Circle" title="wikilink">Vienna Circle</a>, had built up largely as a result of the inspiration they had been given by reading the <em>Tractatus</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn144" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> From 1926, with the members of the Vienna Circle, Wittgenstein would take part in many discussions. However, during these discussions, it soon became evident that Wittgenstein held a different attitude towards philosophy than the members of the Circle whom his work had inspired. For example, during meetings of the Vienna Circle, he would express his disagreement with the group's misreading of his work by turning his back to them and reading poetry aloud.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn145" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> In his autobiography, <a href="Rudolf_Carnap" title="wikilink">Rudolf Carnap</a> describes Wittgenstein as the thinker who gave him the greatest inspiration. However, he also wrote that "there was a striking difference between Wittgenstein's attitude toward philosophical problems and that of Schlick and myself. Our attitude toward philosophical problems was not very different from that which scientists have toward their problems." As for Wittgenstein: <mtpl></mtpl></p>

<p>In 1926 Wittgenstein was again working as a gardener for a number of months, this time at the monastery of Hütteldorf, where he had also inquired about becoming a monk. His sister, Margaret, invited him to help with the design of her new townhouse in Vienna's <em>Kundmanngasse</em>. Wittgenstein, his friend <a href="Paul_Engelmann" title="wikilink">Paul Engelmann</a>, and a team of architects developed a spare modernist house. In particular, Wittgenstein focused on the windows, doors, and radiators, demanding that every detail be exactly as he specified. When the house was nearly finished Wittgenstein had an entire ceiling raised 30mm so that the room had the exact proportions he wanted. Monk writes that "This is not so marginal as it may at first appear, for it is precisely these details that lend what is otherwise a rather plain, even ugly house its distinctive beauty.".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn146" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a></p>

<p>It took him a year to design the door handles and another to design the radiators. Each window was covered by a metal screen that weighed 150 kg, moved by a pulley Wittgenstein designed. Bernhard Leitner, author of <em>The Architecture of Ludwig Wittgenstein</em>, said there is barely anything comparable in the history of interior design: "It is as ingenious as it is expensive. A metal curtain that could be lowered into the floor."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn147" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a></p>

<p>The house was finished by December 1928 and the family gathered there at Christmas to celebrate its completion. Wittgenstein's sister Hermine wrote: "Even though I admired the house very much....It seemed indeed to be much more a dwelling for the gods."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn148" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> Wittgenstein said "the house I built for Gretl is the product of a decidedly sensitive ear and <em>good</em> manners, and expression of great <em>understanding</em>... But <em>primordial</em> life, wild life striving to erupt into the open - that is lacking."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn149" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> Monk comments that the same might be said of the technically excellent, but austere, terracotta sculpture Wittgenstein had modelled of Marguerite Respinger in 1926, and that, as Russell first noticed, this "wild life striving to be in the open" was precisely the substance of Wittgenstein's philosophical work.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn150" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>

<p>At the urging of Ramsey and others, Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge in 1929. Keynes wrote in a letter to his wife: "Well, God has arrived. I met him on the 5.15 train."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn151" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> Despite this fame, he could not initially work at Cambridge as he did not have a degree, so he applied as an advanced undergraduate. Russell noted that his previous residency was sufficient for a PhD, and urged him to offer the <em>Tractatus</em> as his thesis. It was examined in 1929 by Russell and Moore; at the end of the thesis defence, Wittgenstein clapped the two examiners on the shoulder and said, "Don't worry, I know you'll never understand it."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn152" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> Moore wrote in the examiner's report: "I myself consider that this is a work of genius; but, even if I am completely mistaken and it is nothing of the sort, it is well above the standard required for the Ph.D. degree."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn153" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> Wittgenstein was appointed as a lecturer and was made a fellow of Trinity College.</p>
<h3 id="anschluss">Anschluss</h3>

<p>From 1936 to 1937, Wittgenstein lived again in Norway,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn154" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> where he worked on the <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>. In the winter of 1936/7, he delivered a series of "confessions" to close friends, most of them about minor infractions like white lies, in an effort to cleanse himself. In 1938, he travelled to Ireland to visit <a href="Maurice_O'Connor_Drury" title="wikilink">Maurice O'Connor Drury</a>, a friend who became a psychiatrist, and considered such training himself, with the intention of abandoning philosophy for it. The visit to Ireland was at the same time a response to the invitation of the then Irish <a class="uri" href="Taoiseach" title="wikilink">Taoiseach</a>, <a href="Éamon_de_Valera" title="wikilink">Éamon de Valera</a>, himself a mathematics teacher. De Valera hoped Wittgenstein's presence would contribute to an academy for advanced mathematics.</p>

<p>While he was in Ireland in March 1938, Germany annexed Austria in the <em>Anschluss</em>; the Viennese Wittgenstein was now a citizen of the enlarged Germany and a Jew under the <a href="Nuremberg_Laws" title="wikilink">1935 Nuremberg racial laws</a>, because three of his grandparents had been born as Jews. The Nuremberg Laws classified people as Jews (<em>Volljuden</em>) if they had three or four Jewish grandparents, and as mixed blood (<em><a class="uri" href="Mischling" title="wikilink">Mischling</a></em>) if they had one or two. It meant <em>inter alia</em> that the Wittgensteins were restricted in whom they could marry or have sex with, and where they could work.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn155" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a></p>

<p>After the Anschluss, his brother Paul left almost immediately for England, and later the US. The Nazis discovered his relationship with Hilde Schania, a brewer's daughter with whom he had had two children but whom he had never married, though he did later. Because she was not Jewish, he was served with a summons for <em><a class="uri" href="Rassenschande" title="wikilink">Rassenschande</a></em> (racial defilement). He told no one he was leaving the country, except for Hilde who agreed to follow him. He left so suddenly and quietly that for a time people believed he was the fourth Wittgenstein brother to have committed suicide.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn156" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a></p>

<p>Wittgenstein began to investigate acquiring British or Irish citizenship with the help of Keynes, and apparently had to confess to his friends in England that he had earlier misrepresented himself to them as having just one Jewish grandparent, when in fact he had three.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn157" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a></p>

<p>A few days before the invasion of Poland, Hitler personally granted <em>Mischling</em> status to the Wittgenstein siblings. In 1939 there were 2,100 applications for this, and Hitler granted only 12.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn158" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> Anthony Gottlieb writes that the pretext was that their paternal grandfather had been the bastard son of a German prince, which allowed the Reichsbank to claim the gold, foreign currency, and stocks held in Switzerland by a Wittgenstein trust. Gretl, an American citizen by marriage, started the negotiations over the racial status of their grandfather, and the family's large foreign currency reserves were used as a bargaining tool. Paul had escaped to Switzerland and then the US in July 1938, and disagreed with the negotiations, leading to a permanent split between the siblings. After the war, when Paul was performing in Vienna, he did not visit Hermine who was dying there, and he had no further contact with Ludwig or Gretl.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn159" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="professor-of-philosophy">Professor of philosophy</h3>

<p>After G. E. Moore resigned the chair in philosophy in 1939, Wittgenstein was elected, and acquired British citizenship soon afterwards. In July 1939 he travelled to Vienna to assist Gretl and his other sisters, visiting Berlin for one day to meet an official of the Reichsbank. After this, he travelled to New York to persuade Paul, whose agreement was required, to back the scheme. The required Befreiung was granted in August 1939. The unknown amount signed over to the Nazis by the Wittgenstein family, a week or so before the outbreak of war, included amongst many other assets, 1700 kg of gold.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn160" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> There is a report Wittgenstein visited Moscow a second time in 1939, travelling from Berlin, and again met the philosopher <a href="Sofya_Yanovskaya" title="wikilink">Sophia Janowskaya</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn161" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a></p>

<p>Describing Wittgenstein's lecture program, Malcolm continues: <mtpl></mtpl></p>

<p>After work, Wittgenstein would often relax by watching <a href="Western_Movie" title="wikilink">Westerns</a>, where he preferred to sit at the very front of the cinema, or reading detective stories especially the ones written by <a href="Norbert_Davis" title="wikilink">Norbert Davis</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn162" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn163" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> Norman Malcolm wrote that he would rush to the cinema when class ended.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn164" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a></p>

<p>By this time, Wittgenstein's view on the <a href="foundations_of_mathematics" title="wikilink">foundations of mathematics</a> had changed considerably. In his early 20s, Wittgenstein had thought logic could provide a solid foundation, and he had even considered updating Russell and Whitehead's <em>Principia Mathematica</em>. Now he denied there were any mathematical facts to be discovered. He gave a series of lectures on mathematics, discussing this and other topics, documented in a book, with lectures by Wittgenstein and discussions between him and several students, including the young <a href="Alan_Turing" title="wikilink">Alan Turing</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn165" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="world-war-ii-and-guys-hospital">World War II and Guy's Hospital</h3>

<p>Monk writes that Wittgenstein found it intolerable that a war was going on and he was teaching philosophy. He grew angry when any of his students wanted to become professional philosophers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn166" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a></p>

<p>In September 1941 he asked <a href="John_Ryle_(professor)" title="wikilink">John Ryle</a>, the brother of the philosopher <a href="Gilbert_Ryle" title="wikilink">Gilbert Ryle</a>, if he could get a manual job at <a href="Guy's_Hospital" title="wikilink">Guy's Hospital</a> in London. John Ryle was professor of medicine at Cambridge and had been involved in helping Guy's prepare for <a href="the_Blitz" title="wikilink">the Blitz</a>. Wittgenstein told Ryle he would die slowly if left at Cambridge, and he would rather die quickly. He started working at Guy's shortly afterwards as a dispensary porter, meaning that he delivered drugs from the pharmacy to the wards—where he apparently advised the patients not to take them.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn167" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a></p>

<p>The hospital staff were not told he was one of the world's most famous philosophers, though some of the medical staff did recognize him—at least one had attended Moral Sciences Club meetings—but they were discreet. "Good God, don't tell anybody who I am!" Wittgenstein begged one of them.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn168" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> Some of them nevertheless called him Professor Wittgenstein, and he was allowed to dine with the doctors. He wrote on 1 April 1942: "I no longer feel any hope for the future of my life. It is as though I had before me nothing more than a long stretch of living death. I cannot imagine any future for me other than a ghastly one. Friendless and joyless."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn169" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>

<p>He had developed a friendship with Keith Kirk, a working-class teenage friend of <a href="Francis_Skinner" title="wikilink">Francis Skinner</a>, the mathematics undergraduate he had had a relationship with until Skinner's death in 1941 from polio. Skinner had given up academia, thanks at least in part to Wittgenstein's influence, and had been working as a mechanic in 1939, with Kirk as his apprentice. Kirk and Wittgenstein struck up a friendship, with Wittgenstein giving him lessons in physics to help him pass a <a href="City_and_Guilds" title="wikilink">City and Guilds</a> exam. During his period of loneliness at Guy's he wrote in his diary: "For ten days I've heard nothing more from K, even though I pressed him a week ago for news. I think that he has perhaps broken with me. A <em>tragic</em> thought!"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn170" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> Kirk had in fact got married, and they never saw one another again.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn171" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a></p>

<p>While Wittgenstein was at Guy's he met Basil Reeve, a young doctor with an interest in philosophy, who, with Dr R T Grant, was studying the effect of shock on air-raid casualties. When the blitz ended there were fewer casualties to study and in November 1942 Grant and Reeve moved to the <a href="Royal_Victoria_Infirmary" title="wikilink">Royal Victoria Infirmary</a>, <a href="Newcastle_upon_Tyne" title="wikilink">Newcastle upon Tyne</a>, in order to study road traffic and industrial casualties. Grant offered Wittgenstein a position as a laboratory assistant at a wage of £4 per week, and he lived in Newcastle (at 28 Brandling Park, <a class="uri" href="Jesmond" title="wikilink">Jesmond</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn172" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a>) from 29 April 1943 until February 1944.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn173" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a></p>

<p>He resigned the professorship at Cambridge in 1947 to concentrate on his writing, and in 1947 and 1948 travelled to <a class="uri" href="Ireland" title="wikilink">Ireland</a>, staying at Ross's Hotel in <a class="uri" href="Dublin" title="wikilink">Dublin</a> and at a farmhouse in <a class="uri" href="Redcross" title="wikilink">Redcross</a>, <a href="County_Wicklow" title="wikilink">County Wicklow</a>, where he began the manuscript volume MS 137, Band R.

<p>He also accepted an invitation from <a href="Norman_Malcolm" title="wikilink">Norman Malcolm</a>, then professor at Cornell University, to stay with him and his wife for several months at <a href="Ithaca,_New_York" title="wikilink">Ithaca, New York</a>. He made the trip in April 1949, although he told Malcolm he was too unwell to do philosophical work: "I haven't done any work since the beginning of March &amp; I haven't had the strength of even trying to do any." A doctor in Dublin had diagnosed anaemia and prescribed iron and liver pills. The details of Wittgenstein's stay in America are recounted in Norman Malcolm's <em>Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir</em>. During his summer in America, Wittgenstein began his epistemological discussions, in particular his engagement with <a href="philosophical_skepticism" title="wikilink">philosophical skepticism</a>, that would eventually become the final fragments <em><a href="On_Certainty" title="wikilink">On Certainty</a></em>.  He returned to London, where he was diagnosed with an inoperable <a href="prostate_cancer" title="wikilink">prostate cancer</a>, which had spread to his bone marrow. He spent the next two months in Vienna, where his sister Hermine died on 11 February 1950; he went to see her every day, but she was hardly able to speak or recognize him. "Great loss for me and all of us", he wrote. "Greater than I would have thought." He moved around a lot after Hermine's death staying with various friends: to Cambridge in April 1950, where he stayed with <a href="Georg_Henrik_von_Wright" title="wikilink">G. H. von Wright</a>; to London to stay with <a href="Rush_Rhees" title="wikilink">Rush Rhees</a>; then to Oxford to see <a href="Elizabeth_Anscombe" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Anscombe</a>, writing to Norman Malcolm that he was hardly doing any philosophy. He went to Norway in August with Ben Richards, then returned to Cambridge, where on 27 November he moved into "Storey's End", at 76 <a href="Storey's_Way" title="wikilink">Storey's Way</a>, the home of his doctor, <a href="Edward_Vaughan_Bevan" title="wikilink">Edward Bevan</a>, and his wife Joan; he had told them he did not want to die in a hospital, so they said he could spend his last days in their home instead. Joan at first was afraid of Wittgenstein, but they soon became good friends.<ref name="archivefinalyears"><a href="http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/text/biogre11.html">"Ludwig Wittgenstein: Final Years"</a>, Cambridge Wittgenstein archive.

<p>By the beginning of 1951, it was clear that he had little time left. He wrote a new will in Oxford on 29 January, naming Rhees as his executor, and Anscombe and von Wright his literary administrators, and wrote to Norman Malcolm that month to say, "My mind's completely dead. This isn't a complaint, for I don't really suffer from it. I know that life must have an end once and that mental life can cease before the rest does."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn175" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> In February he returned to the Bevans' home to work on MS 175 and MS 176. These and other manuscripts were later published as <em><a href="Remarks_on_Colour" title="wikilink">Remarks on Colour</a></em> and <em><a href="On_Certainty" title="wikilink">On Certainty</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn176" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> He wrote to Malcolm on 16 April 13 days before his death: "An extraordinary thing happened to me.

<h3 id="death">Death</h3>

<p>Wittgenstein began work on his final manuscript, MS 177, on 25 April 1951. It was his 62nd birthday on 26 April. He went for a walk the next afternoon, and wrote his last entry that day, 27 April. That evening, he became very ill; when his doctor told him he might live only a few days, he reportedly replied, "Good!" Joan stayed with him throughout that night, and just before losing consciousness for the last time on 28 April, he told her: "Tell them I've had a wonderful life". Norman Malcolm describes this as a "strangely moving utterance".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn178" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a></p>

<p>Four of Wittgenstein's former students arrived at his bedside—Ben Richards, <a href="Elizabeth_Anscombe" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Anscombe</a>, <a href="Yorick_Smythies" title="wikilink">Yorick Smythies</a>, and <a href="Maurice_O'Connor_Drury" title="wikilink">Maurice O'Connor Drury</a>. Anscombe and Smythies were Catholics; and, at the latter's request, a Dominican friar, Father <a href="Conrad_Pepler" title="wikilink">Conrad Pepler</a>, also attended. They were at first unsure what Wittgenstein would have wanted, but then remembered he had said he hoped his Catholic friends would pray for him, so they did, and he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>Wittgenstein was given a Catholic burial at <a href="Ascension_Parish_Burial_Ground,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground</a> in Cambridge.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn179" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> Drury later said he had been troubled ever since about whether that was the right thing to do.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn180" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a></p>

<p>On his religious views, Wittgenstein was said to be greatly interested in <a class="uri" href="Catholicism" title="wikilink">Catholicism</a> and was sympathetic to it. In his university years, he expressed belief in the <a href="Resurrection_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">Resurrection of Jesus</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn181" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> However, he did not consider himself to be a Catholic. According to <a href="Norman_Malcolm" title="wikilink">Norman Malcolm</a>, Wittgenstein saw Catholicism to be more a way of life rather than as a set of beliefs which he personally held, considering that he did not accept any religious faith.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn182" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn183" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="publication-of-the-philosophical-investigations">1953: Publication of the <em>Philosophical Investigations</em></h2>

<p> The <em><a href="Blue_and_Brown_Books" title="wikilink">Blue Book</a></em>, a set of notes dictated to his class at Cambridge in 1933–1934, contains the seeds of Wittgenstein's later thoughts on language, and is widely read as a turning-point in his philosophy of language.</p>

<p><em>Philosophical Investigations</em> was published in two parts in 1953. Most of Part I was ready for printing in 1946, but Wittgenstein withdrew the manuscript from his publisher. The shorter Part II was added by his editors, Elizabeth Anscombe and Rush Rhees. Wittgenstein asks the reader to think of language as a multiplicity of language-games within which parts of language develop and function. He argues that philosophical problems are bewitchments that arise from philosophers' misguided attempts to consider the meaning of words independently of their context, usage, and grammar, what he called "language gone on holiday".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn186" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a></p>

<p>According to Wittgenstein, philosophical problems arise when language is forced from its proper home into a metaphysical environment, where all the familiar and necessary landmarks and contextual clues are removed. He describes this metaphysical environment as like being on frictionless ice: where the conditions are apparently perfect for a philosophically and logically perfect language, all philosophical problems can be solved without the muddying effects of everyday contexts; but where, precisely because of the lack of friction, language can in fact do no work at all.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn187" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> Wittgenstein argues that philosophers must leave the frictionless ice and return to the "rough ground" of ordinary language in use. Much of the <em>Investigations</em> consists of examples of how the first false steps can be avoided, so that philosophical problems are dissolved, rather than solved: "the clarity we are aiming at is indeed <em>complete</em> clarity. But this simply means that the philosophical problems should <em>completely</em> disappear."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn188" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>

<p>Wittgenstein left a voluminous archive of unpublished papers, including 83 manuscripts, 46 typescripts and 11 dictations, amounting to an estimated 20,000 pages. Choosing among repeated drafts, revisions, corrections and loose notes editorial work has found nearly one third of the total suitable for print.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn189" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> An Internet facility hosted by the <a href="University_of_Bergen" title="wikilink">University of Bergen</a> allows access to images of almost all the material and to search the available transcriptions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn190" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> In 2011 two new boxes of Wittgenstein papers were found.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn191" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a></p>

<p><em><a href="Philosophical_Investigations" title="wikilink">Philosophical Investigations</a></em> was the only nearly finished project and the book was published in 1953. In 1999 a survey among American university and college teachers ranked the <em>Investigations</em> as the most important book of 20th-century philosophy, standing out as "the one crossover masterpiece in twentieth-century philosophy, appealing across diverse specializations and philosophical orientations".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn192" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a></p>

<p>The <em>Investigations</em> also ranked 54th on a list of most influential twentieth-century works in cognitive science prepared by the University of Minnesota's Center for Cognitive Sciences.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn193" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> <a href="Peter_Hacker" title="wikilink">Peter Hacker</a> argues that Wittgenstein's influence on 20th-century analytical philosophy can be attributed to his early influence on the Vienna Circle and later influence on the Oxford "ordinary language" school and Cambridge philosophers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn194" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a></p>

<p>Since Wittgenstein's death, scholarly interpretations of his philosophy have differed. Scholars have differed on the continuity between "early" and "late" Wittgenstein (that is, the difference between his views expressed in the <em>Tractatus</em> and those in <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>), with some seeing the two as starkly disparate and others stressing the gradual transition between the two works through analysis of Wittgenstein's unpublished papers (the <em>Nachlass</em>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn195" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a></p>

<p>One significant debate in Wittgenstein scholarship concerns the work of interpreters who are referred to under the banner of the <a href="New_Wittgenstein" title="wikilink">New Wittgenstein</a> school such as <a href="Cora_Diamond" title="wikilink">Cora Diamond</a>, <a href="Alice_Crary" title="wikilink">Alice Crary</a> and <a href="James_F._Conant" title="wikilink">James F. Conant</a>. The traditional reading of the <em>Tractatus</em> is that its latter arguments are paradoxical and self-undermining. The New Wittgenstein scholars advance a "therapeutic" understanding of Wittgenstein's work—"an understanding of Wittgenstein as aspiring, not to advance metaphysical theories, but rather to help us work ourselves out of confusions we become entangled in when philosophizing".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn196" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> To support this goal, the New Wittgenstein scholars propose a reading of the <em>Tractatus</em> as "plain nonsense"—arguing it does not attempt to convey a substantive philosophical project but instead simply tries to push the reader to abandon philosophical speculation. The therapeutic approach traces its roots to the philosophical work of <a href="John_Wisdom" title="wikilink">John Wisdom</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn197" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> and the review of <em>The Blue Book</em> written by <a href="Oets_Kolk_Bouwsma" title="wikilink">Oets Kolk Bouwsma</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn198" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn199" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a></p>

<p>The therapeutic approach is not without critics: <a href="Hans-Johann_Glock" title="wikilink">Hans-Johann Glock</a> argues that the "plain nonsense" reading of the <em>Tractatus</em> "is at odds with the external evidence, writings and conversations in which Wittgenstein states that the <em>Tractatus</em> is committed to the idea of ineffable insight".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn200" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a></p>
