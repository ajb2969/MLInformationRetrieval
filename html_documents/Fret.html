<h1>Fret</h1>
<hr/>

<p> A <strong>fret</strong> is a raised element on the <a href="neck_(music)" title="wikilink">neck</a> of a <a href="stringed_instrument" title="wikilink">stringed instrument</a>. Frets usually extend across the full width of the neck. On most modern <a href="western_culture" title="wikilink">western</a> fretted instruments, frets are <a class="uri" href="metal" title="wikilink">metal</a> strips inserted into the <a class="uri" href="fingerboard" title="wikilink">fingerboard</a>. On some historical instruments and non-European instruments, frets are made of pieces of string tied around the neck.</p>

<p>Frets divide the neck into fixed segments at intervals related to a <a href="music" title="wikilink">musical</a> framework. On instruments such as <a href="guitar" title="wikilink">guitars</a>, each fret represents one <a class="uri" href="semitone" title="wikilink">semitone</a> in the standard western system, in which one <a class="uri" href="octave" title="wikilink">octave</a> is divided into twelve semitones. <em>Fret</em> is often used as a verb, meaning simply "to press down the string behind a fret". <em>Fretting</em> often refers to the frets and/or their system of placement.</p>
<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2>

<p>Pressing the string against the fret reduces the vibrating length of the string to that between the <a href="bridge_(instrument)" title="wikilink">bridge</a> and the next fret between the fretting finger and the bridge. This is damped if the string were stopped with the soft fingertip on a <a class="uri" href="fretless" title="wikilink">fretless</a> fingerboard.</p>

<p>Frets make it much easier for a player to achieve an acceptable standard of <a href="Intonation_(music)" title="wikilink">intonation</a>, since the frets determine the positions for the correct notes. Furthermore, a fretted fingerboard makes it easier to play <a href="Chord_(music)" title="wikilink">chords</a> accurately.</p>

<p>A disadvantage of frets is that they restrict pitches to the <a href="musical_tuning" title="wikilink">temperament</a> defined by the fret positions. A player may still influence <a href="Intonation_(music)" title="wikilink">intonation</a>, however, by pulling the string to the side to increase string tension and raise the pitch. This technique (commonly called '<a href="bend_(guitar)" title="wikilink">bending</a>') is often used by electric <a href="guitarist" title="wikilink">guitarists</a> of all genres, and is an important part of <a class="uri" href="sitar" title="wikilink">sitar</a> playing. On instruments with frets that are thicker off the fingerboard, string tension and pitch vary with finger pressure behind the fret. Sometimes a player can pull the string toward the bridge or <a href="nut_(instrumental)" title="wikilink">nut</a>, thus lowering or raising the string tension and pitch. However, except for instruments that accommodate extensive string pulling, like the sitar, much less influence on intonation is possible than on unfretted instruments.</p>

<p>Since the intonation of most modern western fretted instruments is <a href="equal_tempered" title="wikilink">equal tempered</a>, the <a class="uri" href="ratio" title="wikilink">ratio</a> of the distances of two consecutive frets to the bridge is

, or approximately 1.059463. Theoretically, the twelfth fret should divide the string in two exact halves. To compensate for the increase in string tension when the string is pressed against the frets, the bridge position is adjusted slightly so the 12th fret plays exactly in tune.</p>

<p> Many instruments' frets are not spaced according to the <a href="semitone" title="wikilink">semitones</a> of <a href="equal_temperament" title="wikilink">equal temperament</a>, including the <a href="Appalachian_dulcimer" title="wikilink">Appalachian dulcimer</a> (with frets in a <a href="diatonic_scale" title="wikilink">diatonic scale</a>), the Turkish <a href="Baglama" title="wikilink">Saz</a> (with frets spaced according to the <a class="uri" href="Makam" title="wikilink">Makam</a> system of <a href="Turkish_folk_music" title="wikilink">Turkish folk music</a>), the Arabic <a class="uri" href="Buzuq" title="wikilink">Buzuq</a> (with frets spaced according to the <a href="Arabic_maqam" title="wikilink">Arabic maqam</a> system), and the Persian <a href="Setar_(lute)" title="wikilink">setar</a> and <a href="Tar_(lute)" title="wikilink">tar</a> (with frets spaced according to the Persian <a class="uri" href="Dastgah" title="wikilink">Dastgah</a> system), and the Turkish <a href="Tanbur_(Turkish)" title="wikilink">tanbur</a> (with as many as 5 frets per semitone, to cover all of the <a href="Comma_(music)" title="wikilink">commas</a> of the Turkish <a class="uri" href="Makam" title="wikilink">Makam</a> system).</p>
<h2 id="variations">Variations</h2>

<p><strong>Fan frets</strong> (or fanned frets, or slanted frets): Most frets are <a class="uri" href="perpendicular" title="wikilink">perpendicular</a> to the instrument's neck centerline and <a href="parallel_(geometry)" title="wikilink">parallel</a> to each other. On a fanned fret board, the frets are spread out like a fan—with only one center fret perpendicular to the necks centerline and the rest angled. This gives the lower-pitched strings more length and the higher strings shorter length (comparable to a piano or a harp where different strings also have different lengths). The idea is to give more accurate tuning and deeper bass. Some think that fanned frets might be more <a class="uri" href="ergonomic" title="wikilink">ergonomic</a>. Fanned frets first appeared on the 16th century <a class="uri" href="Orpharion" title="wikilink">Orpharion</a>, a variant of the <a class="uri" href="cittern" title="wikilink">cittern</a>, tuned like a <a class="uri" href="lute" title="wikilink">lute</a>. John Starrett revived the idea in the late seventies on his innovative instrument, the Starrboard. Rickenbacker employed a slanted fret, but it was not multi scale, or fanned. <a href="Novax_Guitars" title="wikilink">Novax Guitars</a> among others offers such guitars today. The appearance of angled frets on these modern instruments belies the antiquity of this technique.</p>

<p><strong>Scalloped fretboard:</strong> <a href="scalloping_(fingerboard)" title="wikilink">Scalloping</a> involves the wood between some or all of the frets being scooped out. This allows a lighter touch for a more precise playing while executing bends or vibratos (since there's no contact between the fingertips and the wooden part of the fingerboard). It has some popularity with musicians playing <a href="heavy_metal_music" title="wikilink">heavy metal music</a>, although the concept can also be seen in ancient instruments such as the <a class="uri" href="sitar" title="wikilink">sitar</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Fat frets:</strong> on older guitars (especially the <a href="Fender_Stratocaster" title="wikilink">Fender Stratocaster</a>), frets were typically made out of thin wire, and some electric guitar players replaced that with thicker wire, for "fat frets" or "jumbo frets". One possible benefit of using thicker wire is a fatter tone, though Dave Hunter points out that usually there are many more and more important factors in determining guitar tone. Fat frets do make bending easier, and they change the feel of the guitar--"smoother, more buttery". A side effect of a thicker fret is a less precise note, since the string is held over a wider surface, causing a slight blurring of the tone.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="semi-fretted-instruments">Semi-fretted instruments</h2>

<p>It is also possible to find semi-fretted instruments; examples include the <a href="Music_of_Madagascar" title="wikilink">Malagasy</a> <em>kabosy</em> and the <a href="Rubab_(instrument)" title="wikilink">Afghan Rubab</a>. Semi-fretted versions of guitars and other fretted string instruments, however, are usually one-off, custom adaptations made for players who want to combine elements of both types of sound. One arrangement is for the frets to extend only part of the way along the neck so that the higher notes can be played with the smooth expression possible with a fretless fingerboard. Another approach is the use of frets that extend only partway across the fretboard so that some courses of strings are fretted and others fretless, for example Ryszard Latecki's <a href="http://www.unfretted.com/loader.php?LINK=/profs/ryszard">Latar</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fret-intonation">Fret intonation</h2>

<p>Instruments with straight frets like <a href="guitar" title="wikilink">guitars</a> require a special compensation on the saddle and nut. Every time a string is fretted it is also stretched, and as it stretches the string rises in <a href="pitch_(music)" title="wikilink">pitch</a>, making all fretted tones sound sharp. When the saddle is positioned properly, however, the fretted tones all sound sharp to the same degree as long as the distances between the frets are correct. With the right nut compensation, the pitch of the unfretted string can be raised by the same amount. As a result, when the tension of the strings is lowered, the pitches of all notes, both fretted and unfretted, becomes correct.</p>
<h2 id="fret-wear">Fret wear</h2>

<p>On instruments equipped with steel strings, such as <a href="folk_guitar" title="wikilink">folk guitars</a> and <a href="electric_guitar" title="wikilink">electric guitars</a>, frets are eventually bound to wear down as the strings cut grooves into them. When this happens, the instrument may need refretting (the frets are removed and replaced) or, in less severe cases, "fret dressing" (the frets are leveled, polished, and possibly recrowned). Often, a few fret dressings can be performed on a guitar before it requires complete refretting.</p>

<p>Tied gut frets, used on instruments such as the <a class="uri" href="lute" title="wikilink">lute</a> or <a class="uri" href="viol" title="wikilink">viol</a>, wear quickly, and must be replaced regularly.</p>
<h2 id="fret-buzz">Fret buzz</h2>

<p>Fret buzz is one of the many undesirable phenomena that can occur on a <a class="uri" href="guitar" title="wikilink">guitar</a> or similar <a href="stringed_instrument" title="wikilink">stringed instrument</a>. Fret buzz occurs when the vibrating part of one or more strings physically strikes the frets that are higher than the fretted note (or open note). This causes a "buzzing" sound on the guitar that can range from a small annoyance, to severe enough to dampen the note and greatly reduce <a class="uri" href="sustain" title="wikilink">sustain</a>. Sometimes, fret buzz can be so minimal that there is only a small change in the tone (<a class="uri" href="timbre" title="wikilink">timbre</a>) of the note, without any noticeable buzzing. Fret buzz can be caused by different things:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Low <a href="action_(music)" title="wikilink">action</a></li>
<li>Improperly installed frets</li>
<li><a href="string_(music)" title="wikilink">Strings</a> too loose</li>
<li>Improper <a href="relief_(music)" title="wikilink">relief</a> of <a href="guitar_neck" title="wikilink">guitar neck</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Fret buzz is evident in some famous recordings; an example is "<a href="Friends_(Led_Zeppelin_song)" title="wikilink">Friends</a>" by <a href="Led_Zeppelin" title="wikilink">Led Zeppelin</a> (although this example is undoubtedly caused by alternate open tunings that reduce string tension). In some songs, such as "<a href="My_Last_Serenade" title="wikilink">My Last Serenade</a>" by <a href="Killswitch_Engage" title="wikilink">Killswitch Engage</a>, the guitars are tuned to <a href="Dropped_C" title="wikilink">Dropped C</a> and the low tension of the strings are used to create fret buzz by the bass player in order to create a dirty sound.</p>
