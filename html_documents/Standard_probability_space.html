<h1>Standard probability space</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In <a href="probability_theory" title="wikilink">probability theory</a>, a <strong>standard probability space</strong>, also called <strong>Lebesgue–Rokhlin probability space</strong> or just <strong><a href="Lebesgue_space" title="wikilink">Lebesgue space</a></strong> (the latter term is ambiguous) is a <a href="probability_space" title="wikilink">probability space</a> satisfying certain assumptions introduced by <a href="Vladimir_Rokhlin_(Soviet_mathematician)" title="wikilink">Vladimir Rokhlin</a> in 1940. Informally, it is a probability space consisting of an interval and/or a finite or countable number of <a href="Probability_space#General_case" title="wikilink">atoms</a>.</p>
<p>The theory of standard probability spaces was started by <a href="John_von_Neumann" title="wikilink">von Neumann</a> in 1932 and shaped by <a href="Vladimir_Rokhlin_(Soviet_mathematician)" title="wikilink">Vladimir Rokhlin</a> in 1940. Rokhlin showed that the <a href="unit_interval" title="wikilink">unit interval</a> endowed with the <a href="Lebesgue_measure" title="wikilink">Lebesgue measure</a> has important advantages over general probability spaces, yet can be effectively substituted for many of these in probability theory. The dimension of the unit interval is not an obstacle, as was clear already to <a href="Norbert_Wiener" title="wikilink">Norbert Wiener</a>. He constructed the <a href="Wiener_process" title="wikilink">Wiener process</a> (also called <a href="Brownian_motion" title="wikilink">Brownian motion</a>) in the form of a <a class="uri" href="measurable" title="wikilink">measurable</a> <a href="map_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">map</a> from the unit interval to the <a href="function_space" title="wikilink">space of continuous functions</a>.</p>
<h2 id="short-history">Short history</h2>
<p>The theory of standard probability spaces was started by <a href="John_von_Neumann" title="wikilink">von Neumann</a> in 1932<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and shaped by <a href="Vladimir_Rokhlin_(Soviet_mathematician)" title="wikilink">Vladimir Rokhlin</a> in 1940.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> For modernized presentations see , ,  and .</p>
<p>Nowadays standard probability spaces may be (and often are) treated in the framework of <a href="descriptive_set_theory" title="wikilink">descriptive set theory</a>, via <a href="Borel_algebra" title="wikilink">standard Borel spaces</a>, see for example . This approach is based on the <a href="Borel_space#Standard_Borel_spaces_and_Kuratowski_theorems" title="wikilink">isomorphism theorem for standard Borel spaces</a> . An alternate approach of Rokhlin, based on <a href="measure_theory" title="wikilink">measure theory</a>, neglects <a href="null_set" title="wikilink">null sets</a>, in contrast to descriptive set theory. Standard probability spaces are used routinely in <a href="ergodic_theory" title="wikilink">ergodic theory</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>One of several well-known equivalent definitions of the standardness is given below, after some preparations. All <a href="probability_space" title="wikilink">probability spaces</a> are assumed to be <a href="complete_measure" title="wikilink">complete</a>.</p>
<h3 id="isomorphism">Isomorphism</h3>
<p>An <a class="uri" href="isomorphism" title="wikilink">isomorphism</a> between two probability spaces <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (\Omega_1,\mathcal{F}_1,P_1)$</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (\Omega_2,\mathcal{F}_2,P_2)$</span> is an <a href="inverse_function" title="wikilink">invertible</a> map <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f : \Omega_1 \to \Omega_2$</span> such that <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f^{-1}$</span> both are (measurable and) <a href="measure-preserving_transformation" title="wikilink">measure preserving maps</a>.</p>
<p>Two probability spaces are isomorphic, if there exists an isomorphism between them.</p>
<h3 id="isomorphism-modulo-zero">Isomorphism modulo zero</h3>
<p>Two probability spaces <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (\Omega_1,\mathcal{F}_1,P_1)$</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (\Omega_2,\mathcal{F}_2,P_2)$</span> are isomorphic <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \operatorname{mod} \, 0$</span>, if there exist <a href="null_set" title="wikilink">null sets</a> <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle A_1 \subset \Omega_1$</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle A_2 \subset \Omega_2$</span> such that the probability spaces <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \Omega_1 \setminus A_1$</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \Omega_2 \setminus A_2$</span> are isomorphic (being endowed naturally with sigma-fields and probability measures).</p>
<h3 id="standard-probability-space">Standard probability space</h3>
<p>A probability space is <strong>standard</strong>, if it is isomorphic <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \operatorname{mod} \, 0$</span> to an interval with Lebesgue measure, a finite or countable set of atoms, or a combination (disjoint union) of both.</p>
<p>See , , and . See also , and . In  the measure is assumed finite, not necessarily probabilistic. In  atoms are not allowed.</p>
<h2 id="examples-of-non-standard-probability-spaces">Examples of non-standard probability spaces</h2>
<h3 id="a-naive-white-noise">A naive white noise</h3>
<p>The space of all functions <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$</span> may be thought of as the product <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{R}$</span> of a continuum of copies of the real line <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \mathbb{R}$</span>. One may endow <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \mathbb{R}$</span> with a probability measure, say, the <a href="standard_normal_distribution" title="wikilink">standard normal distribution</a> <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \gamma = N(0,1)$</span>, and treat the space of functions as the product <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (\mathbb{R},\gamma)^\mathbb{R}$</span> of a continuum of identical probability spaces <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (\mathbb{R},\gamma)$</span>. The <a href="product_measure" title="wikilink">product measure</a> <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \gamma^\mathbb{R}$</span> is a probability measure on <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{R}$</span>. Many non-experts are inclined to believe that <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \gamma^\mathbb{R}$</span> describes the so-called <a href="white_noise" title="wikilink">white noise</a>.</p>
<p>However, it does not. For the white noise, its integral from 0 to 1 should be a random variable distributed <em>N</em>(0, 1). In contrast, the integral (from 0 to 1) of <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f \in \textstyle (\mathbb{R},\gamma)^\mathbb{R}$</span> is undefined. Even worse, <em>ƒ</em> fails to be <a href="almost_surely" title="wikilink">almost surely</a> measurable. Still worse, the probability of <em>ƒ</em> being measurable is undefined. And the worst thing: if <em>X</em> is a random variable distributed (say) uniformly on (0, 1) and independent of <em>ƒ</em>, then <em>ƒ</em>(<em>X</em>) is not a random variable at all! (It lacks measurability.)</p>
<h3 id="a-perforated-interval">A perforated interval</h3>
<p>Let <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle Z \subset (0,1)$</span> be a set whose <a href="inner_measure" title="wikilink">inner</a> Lebesgue measure is equal to 0, but <a href="outer_measure" title="wikilink">outer</a> Lebesgue measure is equal to 1 (thus, <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle Z$</span> is <a class="uri" href="nonmeasurable" title="wikilink">nonmeasurable</a> to extreme). There exists a probability measure <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle m$</span> on <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle Z$</span> such that <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle m(Z \cap A) = \operatorname{mes} (A)$</span> for every Lebesgue measurable <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle A \subset (0,1)$</span>. (Here <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \operatorname{mes}$</span> is the Lebesgue measure.) Events and random variables on the probability space <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (Z,m)$</span> (treated <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \operatorname{mod} \, 0$</span>) are in a natural one-to-one correspondence with events and random variables on the probability space <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle ((0,1),\operatorname{mes})$</span>. Many non-experts are inclined to conclude that the probability space <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (Z,m)$</span> is as good as <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle ((0,1),\operatorname{mes})$</span>.</p>
<p>However, it is not. A random variable <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle X$</span> defined by <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle X(\omega)=\omega$</span> is distributed uniformly on <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (0,1)$</span>. The conditional measure, given <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle X=x$</span>, is just a single atom (at <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle x$</span>), provided that <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle ((0,1),\operatorname{mes})$</span> is the underlying probability space. However, if <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (Z,m)$</span> is used instead, then the conditional measure does not exist when <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle x \notin Z$</span>.</p>
<p>A perforated circle is constructed similarly. Its events and random variables are the same as on the usual circle. The group of rotations acts on them naturally. However, it fails to act on the perforated circle.</p>

<h3 id="a-superfluous-measurable-set">A superfluous measurable set</h3>
<p>Let <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle Z \subset (0,1)$</span> be as in the previous example. Sets of the form <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle ( A \cap Z ) \cup ( B \setminus Z ),$</span> where <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle A$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle B$</span> are arbitrary Lebesgue measurable sets, are a σ-algebra <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \mathcal{F};$</span> it contains the Lebesgue σ-algebra and <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle Z.$</span> The formula</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\displaystyle m \big( ( A \cap Z ) \cup ( B \setminus Z ) \big) = p \, \operatorname{mes} (A) + (1-p) \operatorname{mes} (B)$$</span> gives the general form of a probability measure <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle m$</span> on <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \big( (0,1), \mathcal{F} \big)$</span> that extends the Lebesgue measure; here <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle p \in [0,1]$</span> is a parameter. To be specific, we choose <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle p = 0.5.$</span> Many non-experts are inclined to believe that such an extension of the Lebesgue measure is at least harmless.</p>
<p>However, it is the perforated interval in disguise. The map</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\displaystyle f(x) = \begin{cases}
 0.5 x &\text{for } x \in Z, \\
 0.5 + 0.5 x &\text{for } x \in (0,1) \setminus Z
\end{cases}$$</span></p>
<p>is an isomorphism between <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \big( (0,1), \mathcal{F}, m \big)$</span> and the perforated interval corresponding to the set</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\displaystyle Z_1 = \{ 0.5 x : x \in Z \} \cup \{ 0.5 + 0.5 x : x \in (0,1) \setminus Z \} \, ,$$</span> another set of inner Lebesgue measure 0 but outer Lebesgue measure 1.</p>

<h2 id="a-criterion-of-standardness">A criterion of standardness</h2>
<p>Standardness of a given probability space <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$</span> is equivalent to a certain property of a measurable map <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f$</span> from <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$</span> to a measurable space <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (X,\Sigma).$</span> Interestingly, the answer (standard, or not) does not depend on the choice of <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (X,\Sigma)$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f$</span>. This fact is quite useful; one may adapt the choice of <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (X,\Sigma)$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f$</span> to the given <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (\Omega,\mathcal{F},P).$</span> No need to examine all cases. It may be convenient to examine a random variable <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f : \Omega \to \mathbb{R},$</span> a random vector <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^n,$</span> a random sequence <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^\infty,$</span> or a sequence of events <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (A_1,A_2,\dots)$</span> treated as a sequence of two-valued random variables, <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f : \Omega \to \{0,1\}^\infty.$</span></p>
<p>Two conditions will be imposed on <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f$</span> (to be <a href="injective_function" title="wikilink">injective</a>, and generating). Below it is assumed that such <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f$</span> is given. The question of its existence will be addressed afterwards.</p>
<p>The probability space <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$</span> is assumed to be <a href="complete_measure" title="wikilink">complete</a> (otherwise it cannot be standard).</p>
<h3 id="a-single-random-variable">A single random variable</h3>
<p>A measurable function <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$</span> induces a <a href="pushforward_measure" title="wikilink">pushforward measure</a>, – the probability measure <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \mu$</span> on <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \mathbb{R},$</span> defined by</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\displaystyle \mu(B) = P \big( f^{-1}(B) \big)$$</span>    for Borel sets <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle B \subset \mathbb{R}.$</span> (It is nothing but the <a href="probability_distribution" title="wikilink">distribution</a> of the random variable.) The image <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f (\Omega)$</span> is always a set of full outer measure,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\displaystyle \mu^* \big( f(\Omega) \big) = 1,$$</span> but its <a href="inner_measure" title="wikilink">inner measure</a> can differ (see <em>a perforated interval</em>). In other words, <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f (\Omega)$</span> need not be a set of <a href="full_measure" title="wikilink">full measure</a> <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \mu.$</span></p>
<p>A measurable function <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$</span> is called <em>generating</em> if <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \mathcal{F}$</span> is the completion of the σ-algebra of inverse images <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f^{-1}(B),$</span> where <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle B \subset \mathbb{R}$</span> runs over all Borel sets.</p>
<p><em>Caution.</em>   The following condition is not sufficient for <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f$</span> to be generating: for every <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle A \in \mathcal{F}$</span> there exists a Borel set <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle B \subset \mathbb{R}$</span> such that <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle P ( A \Delta f^{-1}(B) ) = 0.$</span> (<span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \Delta$</span> means <a href="symmetric_difference" title="wikilink">symmetric difference</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let a measurable function <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$</span> be injective and generating, then the following two conditions are equivalent:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f (\Omega)$</span> is of full measure <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \mu;$</span></li>
<li><span class="LaTeX">$(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P) \,$</span> is a standard probability space.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a-random-vector">A random vector</h3>
<p>The same theorem holds for any <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbb{R}^n \,$</span> (in place of <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbb{R} \,$</span>). A measurable function <span class="LaTeX">$f : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^n \,$</span> may be thought of as a finite sequence of random variables <span class="LaTeX">$X_1,\dots,X_n : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}, \,$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$f \,$</span> is generating if and only if <span class="LaTeX">$\mathcal{F} \,$</span> is the completion of the σ-algebra generated by <span class="LaTeX">$X_1,\dots,X_n. \,$</span></p>
<h3 id="a-random-sequence">A random sequence</h3>
<p>The theorem still holds for the space <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbb{R}^\infty \,$</span> of infinite sequences. A measurable function <span class="LaTeX">$f : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^\infty \,$</span> may be thought of as an infinite sequence of random variables <span class="LaTeX">$X_1,X_2,\dots : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}, \,$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$f \,$</span> is generating if and only if <span class="LaTeX">$\mathcal{F} \,$</span> is the completion of the σ-algebra generated by <span class="LaTeX">$X_1,X_2,\dots. \,$</span></p>
<h3 id="a-sequence-of-events">A sequence of events</h3>
<p>In particular, if the random variables <span class="LaTeX">$X_n \,$</span> take on only two values 0 and 1, we deal with a measurable function <span class="LaTeX">$f : \Omega \to \{0,1\}^\infty \,$</span> and a sequence of sets <span class="LaTeX">$A_1,A_2,\ldots \in \mathcal{F}. \,$</span> The function <span class="LaTeX">$f \,$</span> is generating if and only if <span class="LaTeX">$\mathcal{F} \,$</span> is the completion of the σ-algebra generated by <span class="LaTeX">$A_1,A_2,\dots. \,$</span></p>
<p>In the pioneering work  sequences <span class="LaTeX">$A_1,A_2,\ldots \,$</span> that correspond to injective, generating <span class="LaTeX">$f \,$</span> are called <em>bases</em> of the probability space <span class="LaTeX">$(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P) \,$</span> (see ). A basis is called complete mod 0, if <span class="LaTeX">$f(\Omega) \,$</span> is of full measure <span class="LaTeX">$\mu, \,$</span> see . In the same section Rokhlin proved that if a probability space is complete mod 0 with respect to some basis, then it is complete mod 0 with respect to every other basis, and defines <em>Lebesgue spaces</em> by this completeness property. See also  and .</p>
<h3 id="additional-remarks">Additional remarks</h3>
<p>The four cases treated above are mutually equivalent, and can be united, since the measurable spaces <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbb{R}, \,$</span> <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbb{R}^n, \,$</span> <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbb{R}^\infty \,$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\{0,1\}^\infty \,$</span> are mutually isomorphic; they all are <a href="Borel_space#Standard_Borel_spaces_and_Kuratowski_theorems" title="wikilink">standard measurable spaces</a> (in other words, standard Borel spaces).</p>
<p>Existence of an injective measurable function from <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$</span> to a standard measurable space <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (X,\Sigma)$</span> does not depend on the choice of <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (X,\Sigma).$</span> Taking <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (X,\Sigma) =  \{0,1\}^\infty$</span> we get the property well known as being <em>countably separated</em> (but called <em>separable</em> in ).</p>
<p>Existence of a generating measurable function from <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$</span> to a standard measurable space <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (X,\Sigma)$</span> also does not depend on the choice of <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (X,\Sigma).$</span> Taking <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (X,\Sigma) =  \{0,1\}^\infty$</span> we get the property well known as being <em>countably generated</em> (mod 0), see .</p>

<p>Every injective measurable function from a <em>standard</em> probability space to a <em>standard</em> measurable space is generating. See , , . This property does not hold for the non-standard probability space dealt with in the subsection "A superfluous measurable set" above.</p>
<p><em>Caution.</em>   The property of being countably generated is invariant under mod 0 isomorphisms, but the property of being countably separated is not. In fact, a standard probability space <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$</span> is countably separated if and only if the <a class="uri" href="cardinality" title="wikilink">cardinality</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \Omega$</span> does not exceed <a href="cardinality_of_the_continuum" title="wikilink">continuum</a> (see ). A standard probability space may contain a null set of any cardinality, thus, it need not be countably separated. However, it always contains a countably separated subset of full measure.</p>
<h2 id="equivalent-definitions">Equivalent definitions</h2>

<h2 id="verifying-the-standardness">Verifying the standardness</h2>
<p>Every probability distribution on the space <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \mathbb{R}^n$</span> turns it into a standard probability space. (Here, a probability distribution means a probability measure defined initially on the <a href="Borel_sigma-algebra" title="wikilink">Borel sigma-algebra</a> and completed.)</p>
<p>The same holds on every <a href="Polish_space" title="wikilink">Polish space</a>, see , , , and .</p>
<p>For example, the Wiener measure turns the Polish space <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle C[0,\infty)$</span> (of all continuous functions <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle [0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R},$</span> endowed with the <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topology</a> of <a href="local_uniform_convergence" title="wikilink">local uniform convergence</a>) into a standard probability space.</p>
<p>Another example: for every sequence of random variables, their joint distribution turns the Polish space <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \mathbb{R}^\infty$</span> (of sequences; endowed with the <a href="product_topology" title="wikilink">product topology</a>) into a standard probability space.</p>
<p>(Thus, the idea of <a class="uri" href="dimension" title="wikilink">dimension</a>, very natural for <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topological spaces</a>, is utterly inappropriate for standard probability spaces.)</p>
<p>The <a href="product_measure" title="wikilink">product</a> of two standard probability spaces is a standard probability space.</p>
<p>The same holds for the product of countably many spaces, see , , and .</p>
<p>A measurable subset of a standard probability space is a standard probability space. It is assumed that the set is not a null set, and is endowed with the conditional measure. See  and .</p>
<p>Every <a href="probability_measure" title="wikilink">probability measure</a> on a <a href="Borel_space#Standard_Borel_spaces_and_Kuratowski_theorems" title="wikilink">standard Borel space</a> turns it into a standard probability space.</p>

<p>In the discrete setup, the conditional probability is another probability measure, and the conditional expectation may be treated as the (usual) expectation with respect to the conditional measure, see <a href="conditional_expectation" title="wikilink">conditional expectation</a>. In the non-discrete setup, conditioning is often treated indirectly, since the condition may have probability 0, see <a href="conditional_expectation" title="wikilink">conditional expectation</a>. As a result, a number of well-known facts have special 'conditional' counterparts. For example: linearity of the expectation; Jensen's inequality (see <a href="conditional_expectation" title="wikilink">conditional expectation</a>); <a href="Hölder's_inequality" title="wikilink">Hölder's inequality</a>; the <a href="monotone_convergence_theorem#Lebesgue_monotone_convergence_theorem" title="wikilink">monotone convergence theorem</a>, etc.</p>
<p>Given a random variable <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle Y$</span> on a probability space <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$</span>, it is natural to try constructing a conditional measure <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle P_y$</span>, that is, the <a href="conditional_distribution" title="wikilink">conditional distribution</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle \omega \in \Omega$</span> given <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle Y(\omega)=y$</span>. In general this is impossible (see ). However, for a <em>standard</em> probability space <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$</span> this is possible, and well known as <em>canonical system of measures</em> (see ), which is basically the same as <em>conditional probability measures</em> (see ), <a href="disintegration_theorem" title="wikilink"><em>disintegration of measure</em></a> (see ), and <a href="regular_conditional_probability" title="wikilink"><em>regular conditional probabilities</em></a> (see ).</p>
<p>The conditional Jensen's inequality is just the (usual) Jensen's inequality applied to the conditional measure. The same holds for many other facts.</p>
<h3 id="measure-preserving-transformations">Measure preserving transformations</h3>
<p>Given two probability spaces <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (\Omega_1,\mathcal{F}_1,P_1)$</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (\Omega_2,\mathcal{F}_2,P_2)$</span> and a measure preserving map <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f : \Omega_1 \to \Omega_2$</span>, the image <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f(\Omega_1)$</span> need not cover the whole <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle    \Omega_2$</span>, it may miss a null set. It may seem that <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle P_2(f(\Omega_1))$</span> has to be equal to 1, but it is not so. The outer measure of <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f(\Omega_1)$</span> is equal to 1, but the inner measure may differ. However, if the probability spaces <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (\Omega_1,\mathcal{F}_1,P_1)$</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle (\Omega_2,\mathcal{F}_2,P_2)$</span> are ''standard '' then <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle P_2(f(\Omega_1))=1$</span>, see . If <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f$</span> is also one-to-one then every <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle A \in \mathcal{F}_1$</span> satisfies <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f(A) \in \mathcal{F}_2$</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle P_2(f(A))=P_1(A)$</span>. Therefore <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f^{-1}$</span> is measurable (and measure preserving). See  and . See also .</p>
<p>"There is a coherent way to ignore the sets of measure 0 in a measure space" . Striving to get rid of null sets, mathematicians often use equivalence classes of measurable sets or functions. Equivalence classes of measurable subsets of a probability space form a normed <a href="complete_Boolean_algebra" title="wikilink">complete Boolean algebra</a> called the <em>measure algebra</em> (or metric structure). Every measure preserving map <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f : \Omega_1 \to \Omega_2$</span> leads to a homomorphism <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle F$</span> of measure algebras; basically, <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle F(B) = f^{-1}(B)$</span> for <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle B\in\mathcal{F}_2$</span>.</p>
<p>It may seem that every homomorphism of measure algebras has to correspond to some measure preserving map, but it is not so. However, for <em>standard</em> probability spaces each <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle F$</span> corresponds to some <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle f$</span>. See , , .</p>
