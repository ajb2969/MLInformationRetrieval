<h1>Catch-22 (logic)</h1>
<hr/>

<p>A <strong>catch-22</strong> is a <a class="uri" href="paradoxical" title="wikilink">paradoxical</a> situation from which an individual cannot escape because of contradictory rules.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> For example: <em>To apply for this job, you would have to be insane<strong>;</strong> but if you are insane, you are unacceptable for the job.</em> Catch-22s often result from rules, regulations, or procedures that an individual is subject to but has no control over because to fight the rule is to accept it. Another example is a situation in which someone is in need of something that can only be had by not being in need of it. One connotation of the term is that the creators of the "catch-22" have created arbitrary rules in order to justify and conceal their own abuse of power.</p>
<h2 id="origin-and-meaning">Origin and meaning</h2>

<p><a href="Joseph_Heller" title="wikilink">Joseph Heller</a> coined the term in his 1961 novel <em><a class="uri" href="Catch-22" title="wikilink">Catch-22</a></em>, which describes absurd bureaucratic constraints on soldiers in <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. The term is introduced by the character Doc Daneeka, an army psychiatrist who invokes "Catch 22" to explain why any pilot requesting mental evaluation for insanity—hoping to be found not sane enough to fly and thereby escape dangerous missions—demonstrates his own sanity in making the request and thus cannot be declared insane.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> </p>

<p>Different formulations of "Catch-22" appear throughout the novel. The term is applied to various loopholes and quirks of the military system, always with the implication that rules are inaccessible to and slanted against those lower in the hierarchy. In chapter 6, Yossarian is told that Catch-22 requires him to do anything his <a href="commanding_officer" title="wikilink">commanding officer</a> tells him to do, regardless of whether these orders contradict orders from the officer's superiors.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>In a final episode, Catch-22 is described to Yossarian by an old woman recounting an act of violence by soldiers:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>According to literature professor Ian Gregson, the old woman's narrative defines "Catch-22" more directly as the "brutal operation of power", stripping away the "bogus sophistication" of the earlier scenarios.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="other-appearances-in-the-novel">Other appearances in the novel</h3>

<p>Besides referring to an unsolvable logical <a class="uri" href="dilemma" title="wikilink">dilemma</a>, Catch-22 is invoked to explain or justify the military bureaucracy. For example, in the first chapter, it requires Yossarian to sign his name to letters that he censors while he is confined to a hospital bed. One clause mentioned in chapter 10 closes a loophole in promotions, which one private had been exploiting to reattain the attractive rank of <a href="Private_First_Class" title="wikilink">Private First Class</a> after any promotion. Through <a class="uri" href="courts-martial" title="wikilink">courts-martial</a> for going <a class="uri" href="AWOL" title="wikilink">AWOL</a>, he would be busted in rank back to private, but Catch-22 limited the number of times he could do this before being sent to the stockade.</p>

<p>At another point in the book, a prostitute explains to Yossarian that she cannot marry him because he is crazy, and she will never marry a crazy man. She considers any man crazy who would marry a woman who is not a virgin. This closed logic loop clearly illustrated Catch-22 because by her logic, all men who refuse to marry her are sane and thus she would consider marriage; but as soon as a man agrees to marry her, he becomes crazy for wanting to marry a non-virgin, and is instantly rejected.</p>

<p>At one point, Captain Black attempts to pressure Milo into depriving <a href="Major_Major_Major_Major" title="wikilink">Major Major</a> of food as a consequence of not signing a loyalty oath that Major Major was never given an opportunity to sign in the first place. Captain Black asks Milo, "You're not against Catch-22, are you?"</p>

<p>In chapter 40, Catch-22 forces Colonels Korn and Cathcart to promote Yossarian to Major and ground him rather than simply sending him home. They fear that if they do not, others will refuse to fly, just as Yossarian did.</p>
<h3 id="significance-of-the-number-22">Significance of the number 22</h3>

<p>Heller originally wanted to call the phrase, and hence the book, by other numbers, but he and his publishers eventually settled on 22. The number has no particular significance; it was chosen more or less for <a class="uri" href="euphony" title="wikilink">euphony</a>. The title was originally <em>Catch-18</em>, but Heller changed it after the popular <em><a href="Mila_18" title="wikilink">Mila 18</a></em> was published a short time beforehand.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>The term "catch-22" has filtered into common usage in the English language.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In a 1975 interview, Heller said the term would not translate well into other languages.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>James E. Combs and Dan D. Nimmo suggest that the idea of a "catch-22" has gained popular currency because so many people in modern society are exposed to frustrating bureaucratic logic. They write:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Everyone, then, who deals with organizations understands the bureaucratic logic of Catch-22. In high school or college, for example, students can participate in student government, a form of self-government and democracy that allows them to decide whatever they want, just so long as the principal or dean of students approves. This bogus democracy that can be overruled by arbitrary fiat is perhaps a citizen's first encounter with organizations that may profess 'open' and libertarian values, but in fact are closed and hierarchical systems. Catch-22 is an organizational assumption, an unwritten law of informal power that excepts the organization from responsibility and accountability, and puts the individual in the absurd position of being excepted for the convenience or unknown purposes of the organization.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Along with George Orwell's "<a class="uri" href="doublethink" title="wikilink">doublethink</a>", "Catch-22" has become one of the best-recognized ways to describe the predicament of being trapped by contradictory rules.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="logic">Logic</h2>

<p>The <a href="Archetype" title="wikilink">archetypal</a> <em>catch-22</em>, as formulated by <a href="Joseph_Heller" title="wikilink">Heller</a>, involves the case of <a href="John_Yossarian" title="wikilink">John Yossarian</a>, a <a href="United_States_Army_Air_Corps" title="wikilink">U.S. Army Air Forces</a> <a href="Bombardier_(air_force)" title="wikilink">bombardier</a>, who wishes to be grounded from combat flight. This will only happen if he is evaluated by the squadron's <a href="flight_surgeon" title="wikilink">flight surgeon</a> and found "unfit to fly". "Unfit" would be any pilot who is willing to fly such dangerous missions, as one would have to be <a href="Insanity" title="wikilink">mad</a> to volunteer for possible death. However, to be evaluated, he must <em>request</em> the evaluation, an act that is considered sufficient proof for being declared sane. These conditions make it impossible to be declared "unfit".</p>

<p>The "Catch-22" is that "anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Hence, pilots who request a mental fitness evaluation <em>are</em> sane, and therefore must fly in combat. At the same time, if an evaluation is not requested by the pilot, he will never receive one and thus can never be found insane, meaning he must also fly in combat.</p>

<p>Therefore, Catch-22 ensures that no pilot can ever be grounded for being insane even if he is.</p>

<p>A logical formulation of this situation is: </p>

<p>Philosophy professor Laurence Goldstein argues that the "airman's dilemma" is logically not even a condition that is true under no circumstances; it is a "vacuous biconditional" that is ultimately meaningless. Goldstein writes:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
