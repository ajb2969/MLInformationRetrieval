<p>Informally, an embedding of a graph into a surface is a drawing of the graph on the surface in such a way that its edges may intersect only at their endpoints. It is well known that any graph can be embedded in 3-dimensional Euclidean space

<p>Often, an <strong>embedding</strong> is regarded as an equivalence class (under homeomorphisms of Σ) of representations of the kind just described.</p>

<p>Some authors define a weaker version of the definition of "graph embedding" by omitting the non-intersection condition for edges. In such contexts the stricter definition is described as "non-crossing graph embedding".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>This article deals only with the strict definition of graph embedding. The weaker definition is discussed in the articles "<a href="graph_drawing" title="wikilink">graph drawing</a>" and "<a href="Crossing_number_(graph_theory)" title="wikilink">crossing number</a>".</p>

 is a family of <strong>regions</strong> (or <strong>faces</strong>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> A <strong>2-cell embedding</strong> or <strong>map</strong> is an embedding in which every face is homeomorphic to an open disk.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> A <strong>closed 2-cell embedding</strong> is an embedding in which the closure of every face is homeomorphic to a closed disk.</p>

<p>The <strong>genus</strong> of a <a href="graph_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">graph</a> is the minimal integer <em>n</em> such that the graph can be embedded in a surface of <a href="Genus_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">genus</a> <em>n</em>. In particular, a <a href="planar_graph" title="wikilink">planar graph</a> has genus 0, because it can be drawn on a sphere without self-crossing. The <strong>non-orientable genus</strong> of a <a href="graph_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">graph</a> is the minimal integer <em>n</em> such that the graph can be embedded in a non-orientable surface of (non-orientable) genus <em>n</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>The <strong>Euler genus</strong> of a graph is the minimal integer <em>n</em> such that the graph can be embedded in an orientable surface of (orientable) genus <em>n/2</em> or in a non-orientable surface of (non-orientable) genus <em>n</em>. A graph is <strong>orientably simple</strong> if its Euler genus is smaller than its non-orientable genus.</p>

<p>The <strong>maximum genus</strong> of a <a href="graph_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">graph</a> is the maximal integer <em>n</em> such that the graph can be 2-cell embedded in an orientable surface of <a href="Genus_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">genus</a> <em>n</em>.</p>
<h2 id="combinatorial-embedding">Combinatorial embedding</h2>

<p>An embedded graph uniquely defines cyclic orders of edges incident to the same vertex. The set of all these cyclic orders is called a <a href="rotation_system" title="wikilink">rotation system</a>. Embeddings with the same rotation system are considered to be equivalent and the corresponding equivalence class of embeddings is called <strong>combinatorial embedding</strong> (as opposed to the term <strong>topological embedding</strong>, which refers to the previous definition in terms of points and curves). Sometimes, the rotation system itself is called a "combinatorial embedding".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>An embedded graph also defines natural cyclic orders of edges which constitutes the boundaries of the faces of the embedding. However handling these face-based orders is less straightforward, since in some cases some edges may be traversed twice along a face boundary. For example this is always the case for embeddings of trees, which have a single face. To overcome this combinatorial nuisance, one may consider that every edge is "split" lengthwise in two "half-edges", or "sides". Under this convention in all face boundary traversals each half-edge is traversed only once and the two half-edges of the same edge are always traversed in opposite directions.</p>
<h2 id="computational-complexity">Computational complexity</h2>

<p>The problem of finding the graph genus is <a class="uri" href="NP-hard" title="wikilink">NP-hard</a> (the problem of determining whether an <em>n</em>-vertex graph has genus <em>g</em> is <a class="uri" href="NP-complete" title="wikilink">NP-complete</a>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>At the same time, the graph genus problem is <a href="Fixed-parameter_tractability" title="wikilink">fixed-parameter tractable</a>, i.e., <a href="polynomial_time" title="wikilink">polynomial time</a> algorithms are known to check whether a graph can be embedded into a surface of a given fixed genus as well as to find the embedding.</p>

<p>The first breakthrough in this respect happened in 1979, when algorithms of <a href="time_complexity" title="wikilink">time complexity</a> <em>O</em>(<em>n</em><sup><em>O</em>(<em>g</em>)</sup>) were independently submitted to the Annual <a href="ACM_Symposium_on_Theory_of_Computing" title="wikilink">ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing</a>: one by I. Filotti and <a href="Gary_Miller_(computer_scientist)" title="wikilink">G.L. Miller</a> and another one by <a href="John_Reif" title="wikilink">John Reif</a>. Their approaches were quite different, but upon the suggestion of the program committee they presented a joint paper.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1999 it was reported that the fixed-genus case can be solved in time <a href="linear_time" title="wikilink">linear</a> in the graph size and <a href="Double_exponential_function" title="wikilink">doubly exponential</a> in the genus.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="embeddings-of-graphs-into-higher-dimensional-spaces">Embeddings of graphs into higher-dimensional spaces</h2>

<p>It is known that any graph can be embedded into a three-dimensional space.</p>

<p>One method for doing this is to place the points on any line in space and to draw the <em>m</em> edges as curves each of which lies in one of <em>m</em> distinct <a href="halfplane" title="wikilink">halfplanes</a> having that line as their common boundary. An embedding like this in which the edges are drawn on halfplanes is called a <a href="book_embedding" title="wikilink">book embedding</a> of the graph. This <a class="uri" href="metaphor" title="wikilink">metaphor</a> comes from imagining that each of the planes where an edge is drawn is like a page of a book. It was observed that in fact several edges may be drawn in the same "page"; the <em>book thickness</em> of the graph is the minimum number of halfplanes needed for such a drawing.</p>

<p>Alternatively, any graph can be drawn with straight-line edges in three dimensions without crossings by placing its vertices in <a href="general_position" title="wikilink">general position</a> so that no four are coplanar. For instance, this may be achieved by placing the <em>i</em>th vertex at the point (<em>i</em>,<em>i</em><sup>2</sup>,<em>i</em><sup>3</sup>) of the <a href="moment_curve" title="wikilink">moment curve</a>.</p>

<p>An embedding of a graph into three-dimensional space in which no two of the cycles are topologically linked is called a <a href="linkless_embedding" title="wikilink">linkless embedding</a>. A graph has a linkless embedding if and only if it does not have one of the seven graphs of the <a href="Petersen_family" title="wikilink">Petersen family</a> as a <a href="minor_(graph_theory)" title="wikilink">minor</a>.</p>
