<h1>Fernandez’s method</h1>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Fernandez's method</strong> (FB) is a method which is used in the <a href="multiprocessing_scheduling_algorithm" title="wikilink">multiprocessing scheduling algorithm</a>. It is actually used to improve the quality of the lower bounding schemes which are adopted by <a href="branch_and_bound" title="wikilink">branch and bound</a> algorithms for solving multiprocessor scheduling problem. Fernandez's problem derives a better lower bound than <a class="uri" href="HF" title="wikilink">HF</a>,and propose a quadratic-time algorithm from calculating the bound. It is known that a straightforward calculation of FB takes O<span class="LaTeX">$(n^3)$</span> time, since it must examine O<span class="LaTeX">$(n^2)$</span> combinations each of which takes O<span class="LaTeX">$(n)$</span> time in the worst case.</p>
