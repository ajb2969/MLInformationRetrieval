<p><strong>Heat transfer</strong> describes the exchange of <a href="thermal_energy" title="wikilink">thermal energy</a>, between physical systems depending on the <a class="uri" href="temperature" title="wikilink">temperature</a> and <a class="uri" href="pressure" title="wikilink">pressure</a>, by <a href="Dissipation" title="wikilink">dissipating</a> <a class="uri" href="heat" title="wikilink">heat</a>. The fundamental modes of heat transfer are <em>conduction</em> or <em>diffusion</em>, <em>convection</em> and <em>radiation</em>.</p>

<p>The exchange of <a href="kinetic_energy" title="wikilink">kinetic energy</a> of particles through the boundary between two systems which are at different temperatures from each other or from their surroundings.

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p> <a class="uri" href="Heat" title="wikilink">Heat</a> is defined in physics as the transfer of <a href="thermal_energy" title="wikilink">thermal energy</a> across a well-defined boundary around a <a href="thermodynamic_system" title="wikilink">thermodynamic system</a>. The <a href="thermodynamic_free_energy" title="wikilink">thermodynamic free energy</a> is the amount of work that a thermodynamic system can perform. <a class="uri" href="Enthalpy" title="wikilink">Enthalpy</a> is a <a href="thermodynamic_potential" title="wikilink">thermodynamic potential</a>, designated by the letter "H", that is the sum of the <a href="internal_energy" title="wikilink">internal energy</a> of the system (U) plus the product of <a class="uri" href="pressure" title="wikilink">pressure</a> (P) and <a class="uri" href="volume" title="wikilink">volume</a> (V). <a class="uri" href="Joule" title="wikilink">Joule</a> is a unit to quantify energy, work, or the amount of heat.</p>

<p>Heat transfer is a <a href="process_function" title="wikilink">process function</a> (or path function), as opposed to <a href="functions_of_state" title="wikilink">functions of state</a>; therefore, the amount of heat transferred in a <a href="thermodynamic_process" title="wikilink">thermodynamic process</a> that changes the <a href="thermodynamic_state" title="wikilink">state</a> of a <a href="thermodynamic_system" title="wikilink">system</a> depends on how that process occurs, not only the net difference between the initial and final states of the process.</p>

<p>Thermodynamic and <a href="Mechanical_engineering" title="wikilink">mechanical</a> heat transfer is calculated with the <a href="heat_transfer_coefficient" title="wikilink">heat transfer coefficient</a>, the <a href="Proportionality_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">proportionality</a> between the <a href="heat_flux" title="wikilink">heat flux</a> and the thermodynamic driving force for the flow of heat. Heat flux is a quantitative, vectorial representation of the heat flow through a surface.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>In engineering contexts, the term <em>heat</em> is taken as synonymous to thermal energy. This usage has its origin in the <a href="Nicolas_Léonard_Sadi_Carnot#The_second_law_of_thermodynamics" title="wikilink">historical interpretation</a> of heat as a fluid (<em>caloric</em>) that can be transferred by various causes,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and that is also common in the language of laymen and everyday life.</p>

<p>The <a href="Transport_phenomena" title="wikilink">transport</a> equations for thermal energy (<a href="Thermal_conduction#Fourier's_law" title="wikilink">Fourier's law</a>), mechanical momentum (<a href="Newtonian_fluid" title="wikilink">Newton's law for fluids</a>), and mass transfer (<a href="Fick's_laws_of_diffusion" title="wikilink">Fick's laws of diffusion</a>) are similar,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and analogies among these three transport processes have been developed to facilitate prediction of conversion from any one to the others.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Thermal_engineering" title="wikilink">Thermal engineering</a> concerns the generation, use, conversion, and exchange of heat transfer. As such, heat transfer is involved in almost every sector of the economy.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms, such as <a href="thermal_conduction" title="wikilink">thermal conduction</a>, <a href="convective_heat_transfer" title="wikilink">thermal convection</a>, <a href="thermal_radiation" title="wikilink">thermal radiation</a>, and transfer of energy by <a href="phase_changes" title="wikilink">phase changes</a>.</p>

<h3 id="advection">Advection</h3>

<p>By transferring matter, energy—including thermal energy—is moved by the physical transfer of a hot or cold object from one place to another.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> This can be as simple as placing hot water in a bottle and heating a bed, or the movement of an iceberg in changing ocean currents. A practical example is <a href="thermal_hydraulics" title="wikilink">thermal hydraulics</a>. This can be described by the formula:</p>

<h3 id="conduction">Conduction</h3>

<p>On a microscopic scale, heat conduction occurs as hot, rapidly moving or vibrating atoms and molecules interact with neighboring atoms and molecules, transferring some of their energy (heat) to these neighboring particles. In other words, heat is transferred by conduction when adjacent atoms vibrate against one another, or as electrons move from one atom to another. Conduction is the most significant means of heat transfer within a solid or between solid objects in <a href="thermal_contact" title="wikilink">thermal contact</a>. Fluids—especially gases—are less conductive. <a href="Thermal_contact_conductance" title="wikilink">Thermal contact conductance</a> is the study of heat conduction between solid bodies in contact.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p><em>Steady state conduction</em> (see <a href="Fourier's_law" title="wikilink">Fourier's law</a>) is a form of conduction that happens when the temperature difference driving the conduction is constant, so that after an equilibration time, the spatial distribution of temperatures in the conducting object does not change any further.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In steady state conduction, the amount of heat entering a section is equal to amount of heat coming out.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p><em>Transient conduction</em> (see <a href="Heat_equation" title="wikilink">Heat equation</a>) occurs when the temperature within an object changes as a function of time. Analysis of transient systems is more complex and often calls for the application of approximation theories or numerical analysis by computer.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> </p>
<h3 id="convection">Convection</h3>

<p>The flow of fluid may be forced by external processes, or sometimes (in gravitational fields) by buoyancy forces caused when thermal energy expands the fluid (for example in a fire plume), thus influencing its own transfer. The latter process is often called "natural convection". All convective processes also move heat partly by diffusion, as well. Another form of convection is forced convection. In this case the fluid is forced to flow by use of a pump, fan or other mechanical means.</p>

<p><a href="Convective_heat_transfer" title="wikilink">Convective heat transfer</a>, or convection, is the transfer of heat from one place to another by the movement of <a class="uri" href="fluids" title="wikilink">fluids</a>, a process that is essentially the transfer of heat via <a href="mass_transfer" title="wikilink">mass transfer</a>. Bulk motion of fluid enhances heat transfer in many physical situations, such as (for example) between a solid surface and the fluid.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Convection is usually the dominant form of heat transfer in liquids and gases. Although sometimes discussed as a third method of heat transfer, convection is usually used to describe the combined effects of heat conduction within the fluid (diffusion) and heat transference by bulk fluid flow streaming.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The process of transport by fluid streaming is known as advection, but pure advection is a term that is generally associated only with mass transport in fluids, such as advection of pebbles in a river. In the case of heat transfer in fluids, where transport by advection in a fluid is always also accompanied by transport via heat diffusion (also known as heat conduction) the process of heat convection is understood to refer to the sum of heat transport by advection and diffusion/conduction.</p>

<p>Free, or natural, convection occurs when bulk fluid motions (streams and currents) are caused by buoyancy forces that result from density variations due to variations of temperature in the fluid. <em>Forced</em> convection is a term used when the streams and currents in the fluid are induced by external means—such as fans, stirrers, and pumps—creating an artificially induced convection current.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="convection-cooling">Convection-cooling</h4>

<p>Convective cooling is sometimes described as <a href="Convective_heat_transfer#Newton's_law_of_cooling" title="wikilink">Newton's law of cooling</a>:  However, by definition, the validity of Newton's law of cooling requires that the rate of heat loss from convection be a linear function of ("proportional to") the temperature difference that drives heat transfer, and in convective cooling this is sometimes not the case. In general, convection is not linearly dependent on temperature gradients, and in some cases is strongly nonlinear. In these cases, Newton's law does not apply.</p>
<h3 id="convection-vs.-conduction">Convection vs. conduction</h3>

<p>In a body of fluid that is heated from underneath its container, conduction and convection can be considered to compete for dominance. If heat conduction is too great, fluid moving down by convection is heated by conduction so fast that its downward movement will be stopped due to its <a class="uri" href="buoyancy" title="wikilink">buoyancy</a>, while fluid moving up by convection is cooled by conduction so fast that its driving buoyancy will diminish. On the other hand, if heat conduction is very low, a large temperature gradient may be formed and convection might be very strong.</p>

<p>where Q is the heat flux, ε is the <a class="uri" href="emissivity" title="wikilink">emissivity</a> (unity for a <a href="black_body" title="wikilink">black body</a>), σ is the <a href="Stefan-Boltzmann_constant" title="wikilink">Stefan-Boltzmann constant</a>, and T is the absolute temperature (in Kelvin or Rankine). Radiation is typically only important for very hot objects, or for objects with a large temperature difference.</p>

<p>Radiation from the sun, or solar radiation, can be harvested for heat and power.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Unlike conductive and convective forms of heat transfer, thermal radiation can be concentrated in a small spot by using reflecting mirrors, which is exploited in <a href="concentrating_solar_power" title="wikilink">concentrating solar power</a> generation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> For example, the sunlight reflected from mirrors heats the <a href="PS10_solar_power_tower" title="wikilink">PS10 solar power tower</a> and during the day it can heat water to . </p>
<h2 id="phase-transition">Phase transition</h2>

<p> Phase transition or phase change, takes place in a <a href="thermodynamic_system" title="wikilink">thermodynamic system</a> from one phase or <a href="state_of_matter" title="wikilink">state of matter</a> to another one by heat transfer. Phase change examples are the melting of ice or the boiling of water. The <a href="Mason_equation" title="wikilink">Mason equation</a> explains the growth of a water droplet based on the effects of heat transport on <a class="uri" href="evaporation" title="wikilink">evaporation</a> and condensation.</p>

<p>Types of phase transition occurring in <a href="State_of_matter#The_four_fundamental_states" title="wikilink">the four fundamental states of matter</a>, include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a class="uri" href="Solid" title="wikilink">Solid</a></strong> - Deposition, freezing and solid to solid transformation.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="boiling">Boiling</h3>

<p> The <a href="boiling_point" title="wikilink">boiling point</a> of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> and the liquid <a href="Evaporation" title="wikilink">evaporates</a> resulting in an abrupt change in vapor volume.</p>

<p>Saturation temperature means boiling point. The saturation temperature is the temperature for a corresponding saturation pressure at which a liquid boils into its vapor phase. The liquid can be said to be saturated with thermal energy. Any addition of thermal energy results in a phase transition.</p>

<p>At <strong>low temperatures</strong>, no boiling occurs and the heat transfer rate is controlled by the usual single-phase mechanisms. As the surface temperature is increased, local boiling occurs and vapor bubbles nucleate, grow into the surrounding cooler fluid, and collapse. This is <em>sub-cooled nucleate boiling</em>, and is a very efficient heat transfer mechanism. At high bubble generation rates, the bubbles begin to interfere and the heat flux no longer increases rapidly with surface temperature (this is the <a href="Nucleate_boiling#Departure_from_nucleate_boiling" title="wikilink">departure from nucleate boiling</a>, or DNB).</p>

<p>At <strong>high temperatures</strong>, the hydrodynamically-quieter regime of <a href="Boiling#Film" title="wikilink">film boiling</a> is reached. Heat fluxes across the stable vapor layers are low, but rise slowly with temperature. Any contact between fluid and the surface that may be seen probably leads to the extremely rapid nucleation of a fresh vapor layer ("spontaneous <a class="uri" href="nucleation" title="wikilink">nucleation</a>"). At higher temperatures still, a maximum in the heat flux is reached (the <a href="critical_heat_flux" title="wikilink">critical heat flux</a>, or CHF).</p>

<p>The <a href="Leidenfrost_Effect" title="wikilink">Leidenfrost Effect</a> demonstrates how nucleate boiling slows heat transfer due to gas bubbles on the heater's surface. As mentioned, gas-phase thermal conductivity is much lower than liquid-phase thermal conductivity, so the outcome is a kind of "gas thermal barrier".</p>
<h3 id="condensation">Condensation</h3>

<p>Condensation occurs when a vapor is cooled and changes its phase to a liquid. During condensation, the <a href="latent_heat_of_vaporization" title="wikilink">latent heat of vaporization</a> must be released. The amount of the heat is the same as that absorbed during vaporization at the same fluid pressure.</p>

<p>There are several types of condensation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Homogeneous condensation, as during a formation of fog.</li>
<li>Condensation in direct contact with subcooled liquid.</li>
<li>Condensation on direct contact with a cooling wall of a heat exchanger: This is the most common mode used in industry:
<ul>
<li>Filmwise condensation is when a liquid film is formed on the subcooled surface, and usually occurs when the liquid wets the surface.</li>
<li>Dropwise condensation is when liquid drops are formed on the subcooled surface, and usually occurs when the liquid does not wet the surface.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Dropwise condensation is difficult to sustain reliably; therefore, industrial equipment is normally designed to operate in filmwise condensation mode.
</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="melting">Melting</h3>

<p> Melting is a physical process that results in the phase transition of a substance from a <a class="uri" href="solid" title="wikilink">solid</a> to a <a class="uri" href="liquid" title="wikilink">liquid</a>. The <a href="internal_energy" title="wikilink">internal energy</a> of a substance is increased, typically by the application of heat or pressure, resulting in a rise of its temperature to the <a href="melting_point" title="wikilink">melting point</a>, at which the ordering of ionic or molecular entities in the solid breaks down to a less ordered state and the solid liquefies. An object that has melted completely is molten. Substances in the molten state generally have reduced viscosity with elevated temperature; an exception to this maxim is the element <a class="uri" href="sulfur" title="wikilink">sulfur</a>, whose viscosity increases to a point due to <a class="uri" href="polymerization" title="wikilink">polymerization</a> and then decreases with higher temperatures in its molten state.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="modeling-approaches">Modeling approaches</h2>

<p>Heat transfer can be modeled in the following ways.</p>
<h3 id="climate-models">Climate models</h3>

<p><a href="Climate_models" title="wikilink">Climate models</a> study the <a href="Thermal_radiation" title="wikilink">radiant heat transfer</a> by using quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice.</p>
<h3 id="heat-equation">Heat equation</h3>

<p>The <a href="heat_equation" title="wikilink">heat equation</a> is an important <a href="partial_differential_equation" title="wikilink">partial differential equation</a> that describes the distribution of heat (or variation in temperature) in a given region over time. In some cases, exact solutions of the equation are available;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> in other cases the equation must be solved numerically using <a href="Computational_fluid_dynamics" title="wikilink">computational methods</a>.</p>
<h3 id="lumped-system-analysis">Lumped system analysis</h3>

<p>Lumped system analysis often reduces the complexity of the equations to one first-order linear differential equation, in which case heating and cooling are described by a simple exponential solution, often referred to as <a href="Newton's_law_of_cooling" title="wikilink">Newton's law of cooling</a>.</p>

<p>System analysis by the <a href="lumped_capacitance_model" title="wikilink">lumped capacitance model</a> is a common approximation in transient conduction that may be used whenever heat conduction within an object is much faster than heat conduction across the boundary of the object. This is a method of approximation that reduces one aspect of the transient conduction system—that within the object—to an equivalent steady state system. That is, the method assumes that the temperature within the object is completely uniform, although its value may be changing in time.</p>

<p>In this method, the ratio of the conductive heat resistance within the object to the convective heat transfer resistance across the object's boundary, known as the <em><a href="Biot_number" title="wikilink">Biot number</a></em>, is calculated. For small Biot numbers, the approximation of <em>spatially uniform temperature within the object</em> can be used: it can be presumed that heat transferred into the object has time to uniformly distribute itself, due to the lower resistance to doing so, as compared with the resistance to heat entering the object.</p>
<h2 id="engineering">Engineering</h2>

<p> Heat transfer has broad application to the functioning of numerous devices and systems. Heat-transfer principles may be used to preserve, increase, or decrease temperature in a wide variety of circumstances. Heat transfer methods are used in numerous disciplines, such as <a href="automotive_engineering" title="wikilink">automotive engineering</a>, <a href="thermal_management_of_electronic_devices_and_systems" title="wikilink">thermal management of electronic devices and systems</a>, <a href="HVAC" title="wikilink">climate control</a>, <a href="thermal_insulation" title="wikilink">insulation</a>, <a href="process_(engineering)" title="wikilink">materials processing</a>, and <a href="power_station" title="wikilink">power station</a> engineering.</p>
<h3 id="insulation-radiance-and-resistance">Insulation, radiance and resistance</h3>

<p><a href="Thermal_insulation" title="wikilink">Thermal insulators</a> are materials specifically designed to reduce the flow of heat by limiting conduction, convection, or both. <a href="Thermal_resistance" title="wikilink">Thermal resistance</a> is a heat property and the measurement by which an object or material resists to heat flow (heat per time unit or thermal resistance) to temperature difference.</p>

<p><a class="uri" href="Radiance" title="wikilink">Radiance</a> or spectral radiance are measures of the quantity of radiation that passes through or is emitted. <a href="Radiant_barrier" title="wikilink">Radiant barriers</a> are materials that <a href="Reflection_(physics)" title="wikilink">reflect</a> radiation, and therefore reduce the flow of heat from radiation sources. Good insulators are not necessarily good radiant barriers, and vice versa. Metal, for instance, is an excellent reflector and a poor insulator.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of a radiant barrier is indicated by its <strong>reflectivity</strong>, which is the fraction of radiation reflected. A material with a high reflectivity (at a given wavelength) has a low emissivity (at that same wavelength), and vice versa. At any specific wavelength, reflectivity = 1 - emissivity. An ideal radiant barrier would have a reflectivity of 1, and would therefore reflect 100 percent of incoming radiation. <a href="Vacuum_flasks" title="wikilink">Vacuum flasks</a>, or Dewars, are <a class="uri" href="silvered" title="wikilink">silvered</a> to approach this ideal. In the vacuum of space, satellites use <a href="multi-layer_insulation" title="wikilink">multi-layer insulation</a>, which consists of many layers of aluminized (shiny) <a class="uri" href="Mylar" title="wikilink">Mylar</a> to greatly reduce radiation heat transfer and control satellite temperature.</p>

<h4 id="heat-exchangers">Heat exchangers</h4>

<p>A <a href="heat_exchanger" title="wikilink">heat exchanger</a> is used for more efficient heat transfer or to dissipate heat. Heat exchangers are widely used in <a class="uri" href="refrigeration" title="wikilink">refrigeration</a>, <a href="air_conditioning" title="wikilink">air conditioning</a>, <a href="space_heating" title="wikilink">space heating</a>, <a href="power_generation" title="wikilink">power generation</a>, and chemical processing. One common example of a heat exchanger is a car's radiator, in which the hot <a href="coolant" title="wikilink">coolant fluid</a> is cooled by the flow of air over the radiator's surface.</p>

<p>Common types of heat exchanger flows include parallel flow, counter flow, and cross flow. In parallel flow, both fluids move in the same direction while transferring heat; in counter flow, the fluids move in opposite directions; and in cross flow, the fluids move at <a href="right_angle" title="wikilink">right angles</a> to each other. Common constructions for heat exchanger include shell and tube, <a href="Heat_exchanger#Double_pipe_heat_exchanger" title="wikilink">double pipe</a>, extruded finned pipe, spiral fin pipe, u-tube, and stacked plate.</p>

<p>A <a href="heat_sink" title="wikilink">heat sink</a> is a component that transfers heat generated within a solid material to a fluid medium, such as air or a liquid. Examples of heat sinks are the heat exchangers used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems or the radiator in a car. A <a href="heat_pipe" title="wikilink">heat pipe</a> is another heat-transfer device that combines thermal conductivity and phase transition to efficiently transfer heat between two solid interfaces.</p>

Since the amount of <a href="carbon_dioxide" title="wikilink">carbon dioxide</a> determines the <a href="radiative_balance" title="wikilink">radiative balance</a> of Earth atmosphere, carbon dioxide removal techniques can be applied to reduce the <a href="radiative_forcing" title="wikilink">radiative forcing</a>. Solar radiation management is the attempt to absorb less solar radiation to offset the effects of <a href="greenhouse_gases" title="wikilink">greenhouse gases</a>.</p>
<h3 id="greenhouse-effect">Greenhouse effect</h3>

<p> The <a href="greenhouse_effect" title="wikilink">greenhouse effect</a> is a process by which thermal radiation from a planetary surface is absorbed by atmospheric greenhouse gases, and is re-radiated in all directions. Since part of this re-radiation is back towards the surface and the lower atmosphere, it results in an elevation of the average surface temperature above what it would be in the absence of the gases.</p>
<h3 id="heat-transfer-in-the-human-body">Heat transfer in the human body</h3>

<p>The principles of heat transfer in engineering systems can be applied to the human body in order to determine how the body transfers heat. Heat is produced in the body by the continuous metabolism of nutrients which provides energy for the systems of the body.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The human body must maintain a consistent internal temperature in order to maintain healthy bodily functions. Therefore, excess heat must be dissipated from the body to keep it from overheating. When a person engages in elevated levels of physical activity, the body requires additional fuel which increases the metabolic rate and the rate of heat production. The body must then use additional methods to remove the additional heat produced in order to keep the internal temperature at a healthy level.</p>

<p><a href="Convective_heat_transfer" title="wikilink">Heat transfer by convection</a> is driven by the movement of fluids over the surface of the body. This convective fluid can be either a liquid or a gas. For heat transfer from the outer surface of the body, the convection mechanism is dependent on the surface area of the body, the velocity of the air, and the temperature gradient between the surface of the skin and the ambient air.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The normal temperature of the body is approximately 37 °C. Heat transfer occurs more readily when the temperature of the surroundings is significantly less than the normal body temperature. This concept explains why a person feels “cold” when not enough covering is worn when exposed to a cold environment. Clothing can be considered an insulator which provides thermal resistance to heat flow over the covered portion of the body.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> This thermal resistance causes the temperature on the surface of the clothing to be less than the temperature on the surface of the skin. This smaller temperature gradient between the surface temperature and the ambient temperature will cause a lower rate of heat transfer than if the skin were not covered.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that one portion of the body is not significantly hotter than another portion, heat must be distributed evenly through the bodily tissues. Blood flowing through blood vessels acts as a convective fluid and helps to prevent any buildup of excess heat inside the tissues of the body. This flow of blood through the vessels can be modeled as pipe flow in an engineering system. The heat carried by the blood is determined by the temperature of the surrounding tissue, the diameter of the blood vessel, the <a href="Viscosity" title="wikilink">thickness of the fluid</a>, velocity of the flow, and the heat transfer coefficient of the blood. The velocity, blood vessel diameter, and the fluid thickness can all be related with the <a href="Reynolds_Number" title="wikilink">Reynolds Number</a>, a dimensionless number used in fluid mechanics to characterize the flow of fluids.</p>

<p><a href="Latent_heat" title="wikilink">Latent heat</a> loss, also known as evaporative heat loss, accounts for a large fraction of heat loss from the body. When the core temperature of the body increases, the body triggers sweat glands in the skin to bring additional moisture to the surface of the skin. The liquid is then transformed into vapor which removes heat from the surface of the body.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The rate of evaporation heat loss is directly related to the vapor pressure at the skin surface and the amount of moisture present on the skin.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Therefore, the maximum of heat transfer will occur when the skin is completely wet. The body continuously loses water by evaporation but the most significant amount of heat loss occurs during periods of increased physical activity.</p>
<h3 id="cooling-techniques">Cooling techniques</h3>
<h4 id="evaporative-cooling">Evaporative cooling</h4>

<p> <a href="Evaporative_cooling" title="wikilink">Evaporative cooling</a> happens when water vapor is added to the surrounding air. The energy needed to evaporate the water is taken from the air in the form of sensible heat and converted into latent heat, while the air remains at a constant <a class="uri" href="enthalpy" title="wikilink">enthalpy</a>. Latent heat is describes the amount of heat that is needed to evaporate the liquid; this heat comes from the liquid itself and the surrounding gas and surfaces. The greater the difference between the two temperatures, the greater the evaporative cooling effect. When the temperatures are the same, no net evaporation of water in air occurs; thus, there is no cooling effect.</p>

<p>In <a href="Quantum_Physics" title="wikilink">Quantum Physics</a> laser cooling is used to achieve temperatures of near <a href="absolute_zero" title="wikilink">absolute zero</a> (−273.15 °C, −459.67 °F) of atomic and molecular samples, to observe unique <a href="quantum_effects" title="wikilink">quantum effects</a> that can only occur at this heat level.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Doppler_cooling" title="wikilink">Doppler cooling</a> is the most common method of laser cooling.</li>
<li><a href="Sympathetic_cooling" title="wikilink">Sympathetic cooling</a> is a process in which particles of one type cool particles of another type. Typically, atomic ions that can be directly laser-cooled are used to cool nearby ions or atoms. This technique allows cooling of ions and atoms that cannot be laser cooled directly.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="magnetic-cooling">Magnetic cooling</h4>

<p><a href="Magnetic_evaporative_cooling" title="wikilink">Magnetic evaporative cooling</a> is a process for lowering the temperature of a group of atoms, after pre-cooled by methods such as laser cooling. Magnetic refrigeration cools below 0.3K, by making use of the <a href="Magnetic_refrigeration#The_magnetocaloric_effect" title="wikilink">magnetocaloric effect</a>.</p>
<h4 id="radiative-cooling">Radiative cooling</h4>

<p><a href="Radiative_cooling" title="wikilink">Radiative cooling</a> is the process by which a body loses heat by radiation. <a href="Earth's_energy_budget#Outgoing_energy" title="wikilink">Outgoing</a> energy is an important effect in the <a href="Earth's_energy_budget#Outgoing_energy" title="wikilink">Earth's energy budget</a>. In the case of the Earth-atmosphere system, it refers to the process by which long-wave (infrared) radiation is emitted to balance the absorption of short-wave (visible) energy from the Sun. Convective transport of heat and evaporative transport of latent heat both remove heat from the surface and redistribute it in the atmosphere.</p>
<h3 id="thermal-energy-storage">Thermal energy storage</h3>

<p><a href="Thermal_energy_storage" title="wikilink">Thermal energy storage</a> refers to technologies used to collect and <a href="Energy_storage" title="wikilink">store energy</a> for later use. They can be employed to balance energy demand between day and nighttime. The thermal reservoir may be maintained at a temperature above (hotter) or below (colder) than that of the ambient environment. Applications include later use in space heating, domestic or process hot water, or to generate electricity.</p>

Sonntag: "A heat engine may be defined as a device that operates in a thermodynamic cycle and does a certain amount of net positive work as a result of heat transfer from a high-temperature body and to a low-temperature body. Often the term heat engine is used in a broader sense to include all devices that produce work, either through heat transfer or combustion, even though the device does not operate in a thermodynamic cycle. The internal-combustion engine and the gas turbine are examples of such devices, and calling these heat engines is an acceptable use of the term."<a href="#fnref25">↩</a></li>
