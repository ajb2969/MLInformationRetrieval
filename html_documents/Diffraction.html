<p><strong>Diffraction</strong> refers to various phenomena which occur when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit. In classical physics, the diffraction phenomenon is described as the <a href="Interference_(wave_propagation)" title="wikilink">interference</a> of waves according to the <a href="Huygens–Fresnel_principle" title="wikilink">Huygens–Fresnel principle</a>. These characteristic behaviors are exhibited when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit that is comparable in size to its wavelength. Similar effects occur when a light wave travels through a medium with a varying <a href="refractive_index" title="wikilink">refractive index</a>, or when a <a href="Sound" title="wikilink">sound wave</a> travels through a medium with varying <a href="acoustic_impedance" title="wikilink">acoustic impedance</a>. Diffraction occurs with all waves, including sound waves, <a href="Wind_wave" title="wikilink">water waves</a>, and <a href="electromagnetic_radiation" title="wikilink">electromagnetic waves</a> such as <a href="visible_spectrum" title="wikilink">visible light</a>, <a href="X-ray" title="wikilink">X-rays</a> and <a href="radio_waves" title="wikilink">radio waves</a>.</p>

<p>Since physical objects have wave-like properties (at the atomic level), diffraction also occurs with matter and can be studied according to the principles of <a href="quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">quantum mechanics</a>. Italian scientist <a href="Francesco_Maria_Grimaldi" title="wikilink">Francesco Maria Grimaldi</a> coined the word "diffraction" and was the first to record accurate observations of the phenomenon in 1660.<ref>Francesco Maria Grimaldi, <em>Physico mathesis de lumine, coloribus, et iride, aliisque annexis libri duo</em> (Bologna ("Bonomia"), Italy: Vittorio Bonati, 1665), [<a class="uri" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=FzYVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg">http://books.google.com/books?id=FzYVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg;</a>;=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q;&amp;f;=false page 2]:</ref></p>
<blockquote>

<p><em>Original</em> : Nobis alius quartus modus illuxit, quem nunc proponimus, vocamusque; diffractionem, quia advertimus lumen aliquando diffringi, hoc est partes eius multiplici dissectione separatas per idem tamen medium in diversa ulterius procedere, eo modo, quem mox declarabimus.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p><em>Translation</em> : It has illuminated for us another, fourth way, which we now make known and call "diffraction" [i.e., shattering], because we sometimes observe light break up; that is, that parts of the compound [i.e., the beam of light], separated by division, advance farther through the medium but in different [directions], as we will soon show.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>While diffraction occurs whenever propagating waves encounter such changes, its effects are generally most pronounced for waves whose <a class="uri" href="wavelength" title="wikilink">wavelength</a> is roughly comparable to the dimensions of the diffracting object or slit. If the obstructing object provides multiple, closely spaced openings, a complex pattern of varying intensity can result. This is due to the addition, or <a href="Interference_(wave_propagation)" title="wikilink">interference</a>, of different parts of a wave that travels to the observer by different paths, where different path lengths result in different phases (see <a href="diffraction_grating" title="wikilink">diffraction grating</a> and <a href="Wave_superposition#Diffraction_vs._interference" title="wikilink">wave superposition</a>). The formalism of diffraction can also describe the way in which waves of finite extent propagate in free space. For example, the expanding profile of a laser beam, the beam shape of a radar antenna and the field of view of an ultrasonic transducer can all be analyzed using diffraction equations.</p>

A <strong>glory</strong> is an optical phenomenon produced by light backscattered (a combination of diffraction, <a href="reflection_(physics)" title="wikilink">reflection</a> and <a class="uri" href="refraction" title="wikilink">refraction</a>) towards its source by a cloud of uniformly sized water droplets.|thumb</figcaption>

<p>The effects of diffraction are often seen in everyday life. The most striking examples of diffraction are those that involve light; for example, the closely spaced tracks on a CD or DVD act as a <a href="diffraction_grating" title="wikilink">diffraction grating</a> to form the familiar rainbow pattern seen when looking at a disk. This principle can be extended to engineer a grating with a structure such that it will produce any diffraction pattern desired; the <a href="holography" title="wikilink">hologram</a> on a credit card is an example. <a href="Atmospheric_diffraction" title="wikilink">Diffraction in the atmosphere</a> by small particles can cause a bright ring to be visible around a bright light source like the sun or the moon. A shadow of a solid object, using light from a compact source, shows small fringes near its edges. The <a href="speckle_pattern" title="wikilink">speckle pattern</a> which is observed when laser light falls on an optically rough surface is also a diffraction phenomenon. When <a href="deli_meat" title="wikilink">deli meat</a> appears to be <a class="uri" href="iridescent" title="wikilink">iridescent</a>, that is diffraction off the meat fibers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> All these effects are a consequence of the fact that light propagates as a <a class="uri" href="wave" title="wikilink">wave</a>.</p>

<p>Diffraction can occur with any kind of wave. Ocean waves diffract around <a href="jetty" title="wikilink">jetties</a> and other obstacles. Sound waves can diffract around objects, which is why one can still hear someone calling even when hiding behind a tree.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Diffraction can also be a concern in some technical applications; it sets a <a href="Diffraction-limited_system" title="wikilink">fundamental limit</a> to the resolution of a camera, telescope, or microscope.</p>

<p>The effects of diffraction of light were first carefully observed and characterized by <a href="Francesco_Maria_Grimaldi" title="wikilink">Francesco Maria Grimaldi</a>, who also coined the term <em>diffraction</em>, from the Latin <em>diffringere</em>, 'to break into pieces', referring to light breaking up into different directions.

<p>Diffraction arises because of the way in which waves propagate; this is described by the <a href="Huygens–Fresnel_principle" title="wikilink">Huygens–Fresnel principle</a> and the <a href="superposition_principle" title="wikilink">principle of superposition of waves</a>. The propagation of a wave can be visualized by considering every particle of the transmitted medium on a wavefront as a point source for a secondary <a href="wave_equation#Spherical_waves" title="wikilink">spherical wave</a>. The wave displacement at any subsequent point is the sum of these secondary waves. When waves are added together, their sum is determined by the relative phases as well as the amplitudes of the individual waves so that the summed amplitude of the waves can have any value between zero and the sum of the individual amplitudes. Hence, diffraction patterns usually have a series of maxima and minima.</p>

<p>There are various analytical models which allow the diffracted field to be calculated, including the <a href="Kirchhoff's_diffraction_formula" title="wikilink">Kirchhoff-Fresnel diffraction equation</a> which is derived from <a href="wave_equation" title="wikilink">wave equation</a>, the <a href="Fraunhofer_diffraction" title="wikilink">Fraunhofer diffraction</a> approximation of the Kirchhoff equation which applies to the <a href="near_and_far_field#Far_field" title="wikilink">far field</a> and the <a href="Fresnel_diffraction" title="wikilink">Fresnel diffraction</a> approximation which applies to the <a href="near_and_far_field#Near_field" title="wikilink">near field</a>. Most configurations cannot be solved analytically, but can yield numerical solutions through <a href="finite_element" title="wikilink">finite element</a> and <a href="boundary_element" title="wikilink">boundary element</a> methods.</p>

<p>It is possible to obtain a qualitative understanding of many diffraction phenomena by considering how the relative phases of the individual secondary wave sources vary, and in particular, the conditions in which the phase difference equals half a cycle in which case waves will cancel one another out.</p>

<p>The simplest descriptions of diffraction are those in which the situation can be reduced to a two-dimensional problem. For water waves, this is already the case; water waves propagate only on the surface of the water. For light, we can often neglect one direction if the diffracting object extends in that direction over a distance far greater than the wavelength. In the case of light shining through small circular holes we will have to take into account the full three-dimensional nature of the problem.</p>

<p>In Quantum Mechanics it is a remarkable fact that the mechanism of diffraction is based on radiating particles of a medium, while quantum mechanical waves have no transmitting medium. As being part of the <a href="Wave-particle_duality" title="wikilink">Wave-particle duality</a> this has no physical explanation.</p>

<p>Some examples of diffraction of light are considered below.</p>
<h3 id="single-slit-diffraction">Single-slit diffraction</h3>

<p></p>

<p> </p>

<p>A long slit of infinitesimal width which is illuminated by light diffracts the light into a series of circular waves and the wavefront which emerges from the slit is a cylindrical wave of uniform intensity.</p>

<p>A slit which is wider than a wavelength produces interference effects in the space downstream of the slit. These can be explained by assuming that the slit behaves as though it has a large number of point sources spaced evenly across the width of the slit. The analysis of this system is simplified if we consider light of a single wavelength. If the incident light is coherent, these sources all have the same phase. Light incident at a given point in the space downstream of the slit is made up of contributions from each of these point sources and if the relative phases of these contributions vary by 2π or more, we may expect to find minima and maxima in the diffracted light. Such phase differences are caused by differences in the path lengths over which contributing rays reach the point from the slit.</p>

<p>We can find the angle at which a first minimum is obtained in the diffracted light by the following reasoning. The light from a source located at the top edge of the slit interferes destructively with a source located at the middle of the slit, when the path difference between them is equal to <em>λ</em>/2. Similarly, the source just below the top of the slit will interfere destructively with the source located just below the middle of the slit at the same angle. We can continue this reasoning along the entire height of the slit to conclude that the condition for destructive interference for the entire slit is the same as the condition for destructive interference between two narrow slits a distance apart that is half the width of the slit. The path difference is given by

<p>In the far-field / Fraunhofer region, this becomes the spatial <a href="Fourier_transform" title="wikilink">Fourier transform</a> of the aperture distribution. Huygens' principle when applied to an aperture simply says that the <a href="far-field_diffraction_pattern" title="wikilink">far-field diffraction pattern</a> is the spatial Fourier transform of the aperture shape, and this is a direct by-product of using the parallel-rays approximation, which is identical to doing a plane wave decomposition of the aperture plane fields (see <a href="Fourier_optics" title="wikilink">Fourier optics</a>).</p>
<h3 id="propagation-of-a-laser-beam">Propagation of a laser beam</h3>

<p>The way in which the beam profile of a <a href="laser" title="wikilink">laser beam</a> changes as it propagates is determined by diffraction. When the entire emitted beam has a planar, spatially <a href="Coherence_(physics)" title="wikilink">coherent</a> wave front, it approximates <a href="Gaussian_beam" title="wikilink">Gaussian beam</a> profile and has the lowest divergence for a given diameter. The smaller the output beam, the quicker it diverges. It is possible to reduce the divergence of a laser beam by first expanding it with one <a href="convex_lens" title="wikilink">convex lens</a>, and then collimating it with a second convex lens whose focal point is coincident with that of the first lens. The resulting beam has a larger diameter, and hence a lower divergence. Divergence of a laser beam may be reduced below the diffraction of a <a href="Gaussian_beam" title="wikilink">Gaussian beam</a> or even reversed to convergence if the refractive index of the propagation media increases with the light intensity.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> This may result in a <a class="uri" href="self-focusing" title="wikilink">self-focusing</a> effect.</p>

<p>When the wave front of the emitted beam has perturbations, only the transverse coherence length (where the wave front perturbation is less than 1/4 of the wavelength) should be considered as a <a href="Gaussian_beam" title="wikilink">Gaussian beam</a> diameter when determining the divergence of the laser beam. If the transverse coherence length in the vertical direction is higher than in horizontal, the laser beam divergence will be lower in the vertical direction than in the horizontal.</p>

<p>The ability of an imaging system to resolve detail is ultimately limited by <a href="diffraction-limited" title="wikilink">diffraction</a>.

<p>where <em>D</em> is the diameter of the <a href="entrance_pupil" title="wikilink">entrance pupil</a> of the imaging lens (e.g., of a telescope's main mirror).</p>

<p>Two point sources will each produce an Airy pattern – see the photo of a binary star. As the point sources move closer together, the patterns will start to overlap, and ultimately they will merge to form a single pattern, in which case the two point sources cannot be resolved in the image. The <a href="Rayleigh_criterion" title="wikilink">Rayleigh criterion</a> specifies that two point sources can be considered to be resolvable if the separation of the two images is at least the radius of the Airy disk, i.e. if the first minimum of one coincides with the maximum of the other.</p>

<p>Thus, the larger the aperture of the lens, and the smaller the wavelength, the finer the resolution of an imaging system. This is why telescopes have very large lenses or mirrors, and why optical microscopes are limited in the detail which they can see.</p>
<h3 id="speckle-patterns">Speckle patterns</h3>

<p>The <a href="speckle_pattern" title="wikilink">speckle pattern</a> which is seen when using a laser pointer is another diffraction phenomenon. It is a result of the superposition of many waves with different phases, which are produced when a laser beam illuminates a rough surface. They add together to give a resultant wave whose amplitude, and therefore intensity, varies randomly.</p>
<h3 id="babinets-principle">Babinet's Principle</h3>

<p><a href="Babinet's_Principle" title="wikilink">Babinet's Principle</a> is a useful theorem stating that the diffraction pattern from an opaque body is identical to that from a hole of the same size and shape, but with differing intensities. This means that the interference conditions of a single obstruction would be the same as that of a single slit.</p>
<h2 id="patterns">Patterns</h2>

<p> Several qualitative observations can be made of diffraction in general:</p>
<ul>
<li>The angular spacing of the features in the diffraction pattern is inversely proportional to the dimensions of the object causing the diffraction. In other words: The smaller the diffracting object, the 'wider' the resulting diffraction pattern, and vice versa. (More precisely, this is true of the <a href="sine" title="wikilink">sines</a> of the angles.)</li>
<li>The diffraction angles are invariant under scaling; that is, they depend only on the ratio of the wavelength to the size of the diffracting object.</li>
<li>When the diffracting object has a periodic structure, for example in a diffraction grating, the features generally become sharper. The third figure, for example, shows a comparison of a <a href="Double-slit_experiment" title="wikilink">double-slit</a> pattern with a pattern formed by five slits, both sets of slits having the same spacing, between the center of one slit and the next.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="particle-diffraction">Particle diffraction</h2>

<p>Quantum theory tells us that every particle exhibits wave properties. In particular, massive particles can interfere and therefore diffract. Diffraction of electrons and neutrons stood as one of the powerful arguments in favor of quantum mechanics. The wavelength associated with a particle is the <a href="de_Broglie_wavelength" title="wikilink">de Broglie wavelength</a></p>

<p>For most macroscopic objects, this wavelength is so short that it is not meaningful to assign a wavelength to them. A sodium atom traveling at about 30,000 m/s would have a De Broglie wavelength of about 50 pico meters.</p>

<p>Because the wavelength for even the smallest of macroscopic objects is extremely small, diffraction of matter waves is only visible for small particles, like electrons, neutrons, atoms and small molecules. The short wavelength of these matter waves makes them ideally suited to study the atomic crystal structure of solids and large molecules like proteins.</p>

<p>Relatively larger molecules like <a href="Buckyball_(molecule)" title="wikilink">buckyballs</a> were also shown to diffract.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="bragg-diffraction">Bragg diffraction</h2>

<p>  Diffraction from a three-dimensional periodic structure such as atoms in a crystal is called <a href="Bragg_diffraction" title="wikilink">Bragg diffraction</a>. It is similar to what occurs when waves are scattered from a diffraction grating. Bragg diffraction is a consequence of interference between waves reflecting from different crystal planes. The condition of constructive interference is given by <em>Bragg's law</em>:</p>

<p>Bragg diffraction may be carried out using either light of very short wavelength like <a href="X-ray_crystallography" title="wikilink">X-rays</a> or matter waves like <a href="Neutron_diffraction" title="wikilink">neutrons</a> (and <a href="electron_diffraction" title="wikilink">electrons</a>) whose wavelength is on the order of (or much smaller than) the atomic spacing.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The pattern produced gives information of the separations of crystallographic planes <em>d</em>, allowing one to deduce the crystal structure. Diffraction contrast, in <a href="electron_microscope" title="wikilink">electron microscopes</a> and <a href="diffraction_topography" title="wikilink">x-topography devices</a> in particular, is also a powerful tool for examining individual defects and local strain fields in crystals.</p>
<h2 id="coherence">Coherence</h2>

<p>The description of diffraction relies on the interference of waves emanating from the same source taking different paths to the same point on a screen. In this description, the difference in phase between waves that took different paths is only dependent on the effective path length. This does not take into account the fact that waves that arrive at the screen at the same time were emitted by the source at different times. The initial phase with which the source emits waves can change over time in an unpredictable way. This means that waves emitted by the source at times that are too far apart can no longer form a constant interference pattern since the relation between their phases is no longer time independent.</p>

<p>The length over which the phase in a beam of light is correlated, is called the <a href="coherence_length" title="wikilink">coherence length</a>. In order for interference to occur, the path length difference must be smaller than the coherence length. This is sometimes referred to as spectral coherence, as it is related to the presence of different frequency components in the wave. In the case of light emitted by an <a href="Energy_level" title="wikilink">atomic transition</a>, the coherence length is related to the lifetime of the excited state from which the atom made its transition.</p>

<p>If waves are emitted from an extended source, this can lead to incoherence in the transversal direction. When looking at a cross section of a beam of light, the length over which the phase is correlated is called the transverse coherence length. In the case of Young's double slit experiment, this would mean that if the transverse coherence length is smaller than the spacing between the two slits, the resulting pattern on a screen would look like two single slit diffraction patterns.</p>

<p>In the case of particles like electrons, neutrons and atoms, the coherence length is related to the spatial extent of the wave function that describes the particle.</p>
