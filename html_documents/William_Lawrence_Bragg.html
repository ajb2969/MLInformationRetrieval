<h1>William Lawrence Bragg</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Sir William Lawrence Bragg</strong> <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (31 March 1890 – 1 July 1971) was an Australian-born British <a class="uri" href="physicist" title="wikilink">physicist</a> and X-ray crystallographer, discoverer (1912) of the <a href="Bragg's_law" title="wikilink">Bragg law of X-ray diffraction</a>, which is basic for the determination of <a href="crystal_structure" title="wikilink">crystal structure</a>. He was joint winner (with his father, <a href="William_Henry_Bragg" title="wikilink">William Henry Bragg</a>) of the <a href="Nobel_Prize_in_Physics" title="wikilink">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> in 1915: <em>"For their services in the <a href="X-ray_crystallography" title="wikilink">analysis</a> of <a href="crystal_structure" title="wikilink">crystal structure</a> by means of <a class="uri" href="X-ray" title="wikilink">X-ray</a>"</em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> an important step in the development of <a href="X-ray_crystallography" title="wikilink">X-ray crystallography</a>.</p>

<p>Bragg was <a href="knight_bachelor" title="wikilink">knighted</a> in 1941.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> As of 2014, Lawrence Bragg is the youngest ever <a href="Nobel_Laureate" title="wikilink">Nobel Laureate</a> in physics, having received the award at the age of 25 years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> (The youngest of all Nobel Laureates is <a href="Malala_Yousafzai" title="wikilink">Malala Yousafzai</a> in 2014 at the age of 17) Bragg was the director of the <a href="Cavendish_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Cavendish Laboratory</a>, Cambridge, when the discovery of the structure of DNA was reported by <a href="James_D._Watson" title="wikilink">James D. Watson</a> and <a href="Francis_Crick" title="wikilink">Francis Crick</a> in February 1953.</p>

<h3 id="early-years">Early years</h3>

<p>Bragg was born in <a href="North_Adelaide" title="wikilink">North Adelaide</a>, South Australia. He showed an early interest in science and mathematics. His father, <a href="William_Henry_Bragg" title="wikilink">William Henry Bragg</a>, was <a href="Thomas_Elder" title="wikilink">Elder</a> Professor of Mathematics and Physics at the <a href="University_of_Adelaide" title="wikilink">University of Adelaide</a>. Shortly after starting school aged 5, William Lawrence Bragg fell from his tricycle and broke his arm. His father, who had read about <a href="Wilhelm_Röntgen" title="wikilink">Röntgen</a>'s experiments in Europe and was performing his own experiments, used the newly discovered X-rays and his experimental equipment to examine the broken arm. This is the first recorded surgical use of X-rays in Australia.</p>

<p>After beginning his studies at <a href="St_Peter's_College,_Adelaide" title="wikilink">St Peter's College, Adelaide</a> in 1905, Bragg went to the University of Adelaide at age 16 to study mathematics, chemistry and physics, graduating in 1908. In the same year his father accepted the Cavendish chair of physics at the <a href="University_of_Leeds" title="wikilink">University of Leeds</a>, and brought the family back to England. Bragg entered <a href="Trinity_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Trinity College, Cambridge</a> in the autumn of 1909 and received a major scholarship in mathematics, despite taking the exam while in bed with pneumonia. After initially excelling in mathematics, he transferred to the physics course in the later years of his studies, and graduated with first class honours in 1911. In 1914 Bragg was elected to a Fellowship at Trinity College – a Fellowship at a Cambridge college involves the submission and defence of a thesis.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Among Bragg's other interests was <a href="shell_collecting" title="wikilink">shell collecting</a>; his personal collection amounted to specimens from some 500 species; all personally collected from South Australia. He discovered a new species of <a class="uri" href="cuttlefish" title="wikilink">cuttlefish</a> – <em><a href="Sepia_braggi" title="wikilink">Sepia braggi</a></em>, named for him by <a href="Joseph_Verco" title="wikilink">Joseph Verco</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="career">Career</h3>
<h4 id="work-on-x-ray-crystallography">Work on X-ray crystallography</h4>

<p>Bragg is most famous for his law on the diffraction of <a href="X-ray" title="wikilink">X-rays</a> by crystals. <a href="Bragg's_law" title="wikilink">Bragg's law</a> makes it possible to calculate the positions of the atoms within a crystal from the way in which an X-ray beam is diffracted by the crystal lattice. He made this discovery in 1912, during his first year as a research student in Cambridge. He discussed his ideas with his father, who developed the X-ray spectrometer in Leeds. This tool allowed many different types of crystals to be analysed.</p>
<h4 id="work-on-sound-ranging">Work on sound ranging</h4>

<p>Bragg's research work was interrupted by both World War I and World War II. During both wars he worked on sound ranging methods for locating enemy guns. In this work he was aided by <a href="William_Sansome_Tucker" title="wikilink">William Sansome Tucker</a>, <a href="Harold_Roper_Robinson" title="wikilink">Harold Roper Robinson</a> and <a href="Henry_Harold_Hemming" title="wikilink">Henry Harold Hemming</a>. For his work during WWI he was awarded the <a href="Military_Cross" title="wikilink">Military Cross</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and appointed <a href="Officer_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> He was also <a href="Mentioned_in_Despatches" title="wikilink">Mentioned in Despatches</a> on 16 June 1916, 4 January 1917 and 7 July 1919.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>On 2 September 1915 his brother was killed during the <a href="Gallipoli_Campaign" title="wikilink">Gallipoli Campaign</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Shortly afterwards, William Lawrence Bragg received the news that he had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, aged 25.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>Between the wars, from 1919 to 1937, he worked at the <a href="Victoria_University_of_Manchester" title="wikilink">Victoria University of Manchester</a> as Langworthy Professor of Physics. After World War II, he returned to Cambridge, splitting the <a href="Cavendish_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Cavendish Laboratory</a> into research groups. He believed that "the ideal research unit is one of six to twelve scientists and a few assistants".</p>
<h4 id="work-on-proteins">Work on proteins</h4>

<p>In 1948 he became interested in the structure of proteins and was partly responsible for creating a group that used physics to solve biological problems. He played a part in the 1953 discovery of the structure of <a class="uri" href="DNA" title="wikilink">DNA</a>, in that he provided support to <a href="Francis_Crick" title="wikilink">Francis Crick</a> and <a href="James_D._Watson" title="wikilink">James D. Watson</a> who worked under his aegis at the Cavendish.</p>

<p>Bragg's original announcement of the discovery of the structure of DNA was made at a Solvay conference on proteins in Belgium on 8 April 1953, but went unreported by the press. He then gave a talk at Guys Hospital Medical School in London on Thursday 14 May 1953, which resulted in an article by Ritchie Calder in The News Chronicle of London on Friday 15 May 1953, entitled "Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life."</p>

<p>Bragg was gratified to see that the X-ray method that he developed forty years before was at the heart of this profound insight to the nature of life itself. At the same time at the Cavendish, <a href="Max_Perutz" title="wikilink">Max Perutz</a> was also doing his Nobel Prize–winning work on the structure of <a class="uri" href="haemoglobin" title="wikilink">haemoglobin</a>. Bragg subsequently successfully lobbied for, and nominated, Crick, Watson and <a href="Maurice_Wilkins" title="wikilink">Maurice Wilkins</a> for the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; Wilkins' share recognised the contribution made by researchers (using X-ray crystallography) at <a href="King's_College_London" title="wikilink">King's College London</a> to the determination of the structure of DNA. Among those researchers was <a href="Rosalind_Franklin" title="wikilink">Rosalind Franklin</a>, whose "<a href="Photo_51" title="wikilink">photograph 51</a>" showed that DNA was a double <a class="uri" href="helix" title="wikilink">helix</a>, not a triple helix as <a href="Linus_Pauling" title="wikilink">Linus Pauling</a> had proposed. Franklin died before the prize (which only goes to living people) was awarded.</p>

 helix is an earlier proposal for the structure of polypeptides made by Bragg W L, Kendrew J C &amp; Perutz M F in 1950. It is based on the crystallographic idea of an integral number of residues per turn of the helix. In this conformation, every third peptide is hydrogen-bonded back to the first peptide, thus forming a ring containing ten atoms.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

Although Hunter, in his book on Bragg <em>Light is a Messenger</em>, argued that he was more a crystallographer than a physicist, Bragg's lifelong activity showed otherwise—he was more of a physicist than anything else. Thus, from 1939 to 1943, he served as President of the <a href="Institute_of_Physics" title="wikilink">Institute of Physics</a>, London.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In the <a href="1967_New_Year_Honours" title="wikilink">1967 New Year Honours</a> he was appointed <a href="Companion_of_Honour" title="wikilink">Companion of Honour</a> by Queen Elizabeth II.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
