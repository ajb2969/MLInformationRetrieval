<p> <strong>Nikola Tesla</strong> (10 July 1856 - 7 January 1943) was a world-renowned <a class="uri" href="inventor" title="wikilink">inventor</a>, <a class="uri" href="physicist" title="wikilink">physicist</a>, <a href="mechanical_engineer" title="wikilink">mechanical engineer</a> and <a href="electrical_engineer" title="wikilink">electrical engineer</a>. He was born an ethnic <a class="uri" href="Serb" title="wikilink">Serb</a> citizen of the <a href="Austrian_Empire" title="wikilink">Austrian Empire</a> and later became an <a href="American_citizen" title="wikilink">American citizen</a>. Tesla is best known for his revolutionary work in, and numerous contributions to, the discipline of <a href="electricity_and_magnetism" title="wikilink">electricity and magnetism</a> in the late 19th and early <a href="20th_century" title="wikilink">20th century</a>. <a href="List_of_Tesla_patents" title="wikilink">Tesla's patents</a> and theoretical work formed the basis of modern <a href="alternating_current" title="wikilink">alternating current</a> <a href="electric_power" title="wikilink">electric power</a> (AC) systems, including the <a href="polyphase_system" title="wikilink">polyphase</a> <a href="power_distribution" title="wikilink">power distribution</a> systems and the <a href="Electric_motor#AC_motor" title="wikilink">AC motor</a>, with which he helped usher in the <a href="Second_Industrial_Revolution" title="wikilink">Second Industrial Revolution</a>.</p>

<p>After his demonstration of <a href="Transmission_(telecommunications)" title="wikilink">wireless communication</a> in 1893 and after being the victor in the "<a href="War_of_Currents" title="wikilink">War of Currents</a>", he was widely respected as America's greatest electrical engineer. Much of his early work pioneered modern electrical engineering and many of his discoveries were of groundbreaking importance. In the United States, Tesla's fame rivaled that of any other inventor or scientist in <a class="uri" href="history" title="wikilink">history</a> or <a href="popular_culture" title="wikilink">popular culture</a>, but due to his eccentric personality and, at the time, unbelievable and sometimes bizarre claims about possible scientific and technological developments, Tesla was ultimately ostracized and regarded as a <em><a href="mad_scientist" title="wikilink">mad scientist</a></em>. Never putting much focus on his finances, Tesla died impoverished at the age of 86.</p>

), the <a href="tesla_(unit)" title="wikilink">tesla</a>, was named in his honour (at the <em>Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures</em>, <a class="uri" href="Paris" title="wikilink">Paris</a>, 1960).</p>

<p>Aside from his work on <a class="uri" href="electromagnetism" title="wikilink">electromagnetism</a> and engineering, Tesla is said to have contributed in varying degrees to the establishment of <a class="uri" href="robotics" title="wikilink">robotics</a>, <a href="remote_control" title="wikilink">remote control</a>, <a class="uri" href="radar" title="wikilink">radar</a> and <a href="computer_science" title="wikilink">computer science</a> and to the expansion of <a class="uri" href="ballistics" title="wikilink">ballistics</a>, <a href="nuclear_physics" title="wikilink">nuclear physics</a> and <a href="theoretical_physics" title="wikilink">theoretical physics</a>. In 1943, the <a href="Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Supreme Court of the United States</a> credited him as being the <a href="invention_of_radio" title="wikilink">inventor of the radio</a>. Many of his achievements have been used, with some <a class="uri" href="controversy" title="wikilink">controversy</a>, to support various <a href="pseudoscience" title="wikilink">pseudosciences</a>, <a href="unidentified_flying_object" title="wikilink">UFO theories</a> and <a href="new_age" title="wikilink">new age</a> <a href="occult" title="wikilink">occultism</a>. Contemporary researchers of Tesla have deemed him "the man who invented the twentieth century" and "the <a href="patron_saint" title="wikilink">patron saint</a> of modern electricity.""</p>
