<h1>Soil gradation</h1>
<hr/>

<p> <strong>Soil gradation</strong> is a classification of a coarse-grained <a class="uri" href="soil" title="wikilink">soil</a> that ranks the soil based on the different particle sizes contained in the soil.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Soil gradation is an important aspect of <a href="soil_mechanics" title="wikilink">soil mechanics</a> and <a href="geotechnical_engineering" title="wikilink">geotechnical engineering</a> because it is an indicator of other engineering properties such as compressibility, shear strength, and hydraulic conductivity. In a design, the gradation of the in situ or on site soil often controls the design and ground water drainage of the site. A poorly graded soil will have better drainage than a well graded soil.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Soil is graded as either well graded or poorly graded.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> ref Dr.B.C PUNMIA- Soil Mechanics and Khanna civil engineering hand book ,Delhi.</p>

<p>Soil gradation is determined by analyzing the results of a <a href="sieve_analysis" title="wikilink">sieve analysis</a> <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> or a <a href="hydrometer" title="wikilink">hydrometer analysis</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>The process for grading a soil is in accordance with either the <a href="Unified_Soil_Classification_System" title="wikilink">Unified Soil Classification System</a> or the <a href="AASHTO_Soil_Classification_System" title="wikilink">AASHTO Soil Classification System</a>. Gradation of a soil is determined by reading the grain size distribution curve produced from the results of laboratory tests on the soil. Gradation of a soil can also be determined by calculating the coefficient of uniformity, C<sub>u</sub>, and the coefficient of curvature, C<sub>c</sub>, of the soil and comparing the calculated values with published gradation limits.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="soil-gradations">Soil Gradations</h2>

<p>Soil gradation is a classification of the particle size distribution of a soil. Coarse-grained soils, mainly gravels or sands, are graded as either well graded or poorly graded. Poorly graded soils are further divided into uniformly-graded or gap-graded soils. Fine-grained soils, mainly silts and clays, are classified according to their <a href="Atterberg_limits" title="wikilink">Atterberg limits</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="well-graded">Well Graded</h3>

<p>A <em>well graded</em> soil is a soil that contains particles of a wide range of sizes and has a good representation of all sizes from the No. 4 to No. 200 sieves.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> A well graded gravel is classified as GW while a well graded sand is classified as SW.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="poorly-graded">Poorly Graded</h3>

<p>A <em>poorly graded</em> soil is a soil that does not have a good representation of all sizes of particles from the No. 4 to No. 200 sieve. A poorly graded gravel is classified as GP while a poorly graded sand is classified as SP. Poorly graded soils are more susceptible to <a href="soil_liquefaction" title="wikilink">soil liquefaction</a> than well graded soils.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> A soil having particles of nearly the same size is known as poorly graded soil. ref-soil mechanics by - Professor B.C punmia and soil engineering by Professor Shamsher Prakash and Khanna civil Engineering hand book ,Delhi, India, IIT Delhi publications. Ref -ASCE ,USA</p>

<p>A <em>gap-graded</em> soil is a soil that has an excess or deficiency of certain particle sizes or a soil that has at least one particle size missing.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> An example of a gap-graded soil is one in which sand of the No. 10 and No. 40 sizes are missing, and all the other sizes are present.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="process-of-grading-a-soil">Process of Grading a Soil</h3>

<p>The process of grading a soil is in accordance with either the Unified Soil Classification System or the AASHTO Soil Classification System. The steps in grading a soil are data collection, calculating coefficients of uniformity and curvature, and grading the soil based on the grading criteria given in the used soil classification system.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h4>

<p>Soil gradation is determined by analyzing the results of a <a href="sieve_analysis" title="wikilink">sieve analysis</a> or a <a href="hydrometer" title="wikilink">hydrometer analysis</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>In a sieve analysis, a coarse-grained soil sample is shaken through a series of woven-wire square-mesh sieves. Each sieve has successively smaller openings so particles larger than the size of each sieve are retained on the sieve.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The percentage of each soil size is measured by weighing the amount retained on each sieve and comparing the weight to the total weight of the sample. The results of a sieve analysis are plotted as a grain size distribution curve, which is then analyzed to determine the soil gradation of the particular soil.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p>In a hydrometer analysis, a fine-grained soil sample is left to settle in a <a href="viscosity" title="wikilink">viscous</a> fluid. This method is used based on <a href="Stoke's_Law" title="wikilink">Stoke's Law</a> which relates terminal velocity of fall of a particle in a viscous fluid to the grain diameter and density of the grain in suspension.Grain diameter is calculated from a known distance and time of the fall of the particle. This is used to classify fine-grained soils.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="calculating-the-coefficients-of-uniformity-and-curvature">Calculating the Coefficients of Uniformity and Curvature</h4>

<p>Calculating the coefficients of uniformity and curvature requires grain diameters. The grain diameter can be found for each percent of the soil passing a particular sieve. This means that if 40% of the sample is retained on the No. 20 sieve then there is 60% passing the No. 20 sieve.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>The <em>coefficient of uniformity</em>, C<sub>u</sub> is a crude shape parameter and is calculated using the following equation:</p>

<p>Once the coefficient of uniformity and the coefficient of curvature have been calculated, they must be compared to published gradation criteria.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="criteria-for-grading-soils">Criteria for Grading Soils</h4>

<p>The following criteria are in accordance with the Unified Soil Classification System:</p>

<p>For a gravel to be classified as well graded, the following criteria must be met:</p>

<p>C<sub>u</sub> &gt; 4 &amp; 1 c u ≥ 6 &amp; 1 c </p>
<h3 id="importance">Importance</h3>

<p>Soil gradation is very important to geotechnical engineering. It is an indicator of other engineering properties such as compressibility, shear strength, and hydraulic conductivity.</p>

<p>In a design, the gradation of the in situ or on site soil often controls the design and ground water drainage of the site. A poorly graded soil will have better drainage than a well graded soil because there are more void spaces in a poorly graded soil.</p>

<p>When a fill material is being selected for a project such as a highway embankment or earthen dam, the soil gradation is considered. A well graded soil is able to be compacted more than a poorly graded soil. These types of projects may also have gradation requirements that must be met before the soil to be used is accepted.</p>

<p>When options for ground remediation techniques are being selected, the soil gradation is a controlling factor.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
