<h1>PPAD (complexity)</h1>
<hr>In [[computer science]], '''PPAD''' (''"Polynomial Parity Arguments on Directed graphs"'') is a [[complexity class]] introduced by [[Christos Papadimitriou]] in 1994. PPAD is a subclass of [[TFNP]] based on functions that can be shown to be total by a parity argument.<ref>{{cite journal | author = [[Christos Papadimitriou]] | year = 1994 | title = On the complexity of the parity argument and other inefficient proofs of exis

<p>PPAD is a class of problems that are believed to be hard, but obtaining PPAD-completeness is a weaker evidence of intractability than that of obtaining <a class="uri" href="NP-completeness" title="wikilink">NP-completeness</a>. PPAD problems cannot be NP-complete, for the technical reason that NP is a class of decision problems, but the answer of PPAD problems is always yes, as a solution is known to exist, even though it might be hard to find that solution. <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> It could still be the case that PPAD is the same class as <a href="P_(complexity)" title="wikilink">P</a>, and still have that <a href="P_versus_NP_problem" title="wikilink">P

<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>

<p>PPAD is a subset of the class <a class="uri" href="TFNP" title="wikilink">TFNP</a>, the class of <a href="function_problem" title="wikilink">function problems</a> in <a href="FNP_(complexity)" title="wikilink">FNP</a> that are guaranteed to be <a href="total_function" title="wikilink">total</a>. The <a class="uri" href="TFNP" title="wikilink">TFNP</a> formal definition is given as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>A binary relation P(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) is in TFNP if and only if there is a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that can determine whether P(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) holds given both <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, and for every <em>x</em>, there exists a <em>y</em> such that P(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) holds.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Subclasses of TFNP are defined based on the type of mathematical proof used to prove that a solution always exists. Informally, PPAD is the subclass of TFNP where the guarantee that there exists a <em>y</em> such that P(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) holds is based on a parity argument on a directed graph. The class is formally defined by specifying one of its complete problems, known as <em>End-Of-The-Line</em>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>G is a (possibly exponentially large) directed graph with no isolated vertices, and with every <a href="Vertex_(graph_theory)" title="wikilink">vertex</a> having at most one predecessor and one successor. G is specified by giving a polynomial-time computable function f(<em>v</em>) (polynomial in the size of <em>v</em>) that returns the predecessor and successor (if they exist) of the vertex <em>v</em>. Given a vertex <em>s</em> in G with no predecessor, find a vertex <em>t≠s</em> with no predecessor or no successor. (The input to the problem is the source vertex <em>s</em> and the function f(<em>v</em>)). In other words, we want any source or sink of the directed graph other than <em>s</em>.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Such a <em>t</em> must exist if an <em>s</em> does, because the structure of G means that vertices with only one neighbour come in pairs. In particular, given <em>s</em>, we can find such a <em>t</em> at the other end of the string starting at <em>s</em>. (Note that this may take exponential time if we just evaluate f repeatedly.)</p>
