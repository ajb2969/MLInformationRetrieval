<h1>SL (complexity)</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a href="computational_complexity_theory" title="wikilink">computational complexity theory</a>, <strong>SL</strong> (<strong>Symmetric Logspace</strong> or <strong>Sym-L</strong>) is the <a href="complexity_class" title="wikilink">complexity class</a> of problems <a href="log-space_reducible" title="wikilink">log-space reducible</a> to <strong>USTCON</strong> (<em>undirected s-t connectivity</em>), which is the problem of determining whether there exists a path between two vertices in an <a href="undirected_graph" title="wikilink">undirected graph</a>, otherwise described as the problem of determining whether two vertices are in the same <a href="Connected_component_(graph_theory)" title="wikilink">connected component</a>. This problem is also called the <strong>undirected reachability problem</strong>. It does not matter whether <a href="many-one_reduction" title="wikilink">many-one reducibility</a> or <a href="Turing_reduction" title="wikilink">Turing reducibility</a> is used. Although originally described in terms of <a href="symmetric_Turing_machine" title="wikilink">symmetric Turing machines</a>, that equivalent formulation is very complex, and the reducibility definition is what is used in practice.</p>

<p>USTCON is a special case of <a class="uri" href="STCON" title="wikilink">STCON</a> (<em>directed reachability</em>), the problem of determining whether a directed path between two vertices in a <a href="directed_graph" title="wikilink">directed graph</a> exists, which is complete for <a href="NL_(complexity)" title="wikilink">NL</a>. Because USTCON is <strong>SL</strong>-complete, most advances that impact USTCON have also impacted <strong>SL</strong>. Thus they are connected, and discussed together.</p>

<p>In October 2004 <a href="Omer_Reingold" title="wikilink">Omer Reingold</a> showed that <strong>SL</strong> = <strong><a href="L_(complexity)" title="wikilink">L</a></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="origin">Origin</h2>

<p>SL was first defined in 1982 by Lewis and Papadimitriou,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> who were looking for a class in which to place USTCON, which until this time could, at best, be placed only in <a href="NL_(complexity)" title="wikilink">NL</a>, despite seeming not to require nondeterminism. They defined the <a href="symmetric_Turing_machine" title="wikilink">symmetric Turing machine</a>, used it to define SL, showed that USTCON was complete for SL, and proved that</p>

 where <a href="L_(complexity)" title="wikilink">L</a> is the more well-known class of problems solvable by an ordinary <a href="deterministic_Turing_machine" title="wikilink">deterministic Turing machine</a> in logarithmic space, and NL is the class of problems solvable by <a href="nondeterministic_Turing_machines" title="wikilink">nondeterministic Turing machines</a> in logarithmic space. The result of Reingold, discussed later, shows that in fact, when limited to log space, the symmetric Turing machine is equivalent in power to the deterministic Turing machine.</p>
<h2 id="complete-problems">Complete problems</h2>

<p>By definition, USTCON is complete for SL (all problems in SL reduce to it, including itself). Many more interesting complete problems were found, most by reducing directly or indirectly from USTCON, and a compendium of them was made by Àlvarez and Greenlaw.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Many of the problems are <a href="graph_theory" title="wikilink">graph theory</a> problems. Some of the simplest and most important SL-complete problems they describe include:</p>
<ul>
<li>USTCON</li>
<li>Simulation of symmetric Turing machines: does an STM accept a given input in a certain space, given in unary?</li>
<li>Vertex-disjoint paths: are there <em>k</em> paths between two vertices, sharing vertices only at the endpoints? (a generalization of USTCON, equivalent to asking whether a graph is <em>k</em>-edge-connected)</li>
<li>Is a given graph a <a href="bipartite_graph" title="wikilink">bipartite graph</a>, or equivalently, does it have a <a href="graph_coloring" title="wikilink">graph coloring</a> using 2 colors?</li>
<li>Do two undirected graphs have the same number of <a href="Connected_component_(graph_theory)" title="wikilink">connected components</a>?</li>
<li>Does a graph have an even number of connected components?</li>
<li>Given a graph, is there a cycle containing a given edge?</li>
<li>Do the <a href="spanning_forest" title="wikilink">spanning forests</a> of two graphs have the same number of edges?</li>
<li>Given a graph where all its edges have distinct weights, is a given edge in the <a href="minimum_weight_spanning_forest" title="wikilink">minimum weight spanning forest</a>?</li>
<li><a href="Exclusive_or" title="wikilink">Exclusive or</a> 2-<a href="Boolean_satisfiability_problem" title="wikilink">satisfiability</a>: given a formula requiring that <em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> xor <em>x</em><sub><em>j</em></sub> hold for a number of pairs of variables (<em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>,<em>x</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>), is there an assignment to the variables that makes it true?</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="complement_(complexity)" title="wikilink">complements</a> of all these problems are in SL as well, since, as we will see, SL is closed under complement.</p>

<p>From the fact that <strong>L</strong> = <strong>SL</strong>, it follows that many more problems are SL-complete with respect to log-space reductions: every problem in <strong>L</strong> or in <strong>SL</strong> is <strong>SL</strong>-complete; moreover, even if the reductions are in some smaller class than <strong>L</strong>, <strong>L</strong>-completeness is equivalent to <strong>SL</strong>-completeness. In this sense this class has become somewhat trivial.</p>
<h2 id="important-results">Important results</h2>

<p>There are well-known classical algorithms such as <a href="depth-first_search" title="wikilink">depth-first search</a> and <a href="breadth-first_search" title="wikilink">breadth-first search</a> which solve USTCON in linear time and space. Their existence, shown long before <strong>SL</strong> was defined, proves that <strong>SL</strong> is contained in <strong>P</strong>. It's also not difficult to show that USTCON, and so <strong>SL</strong>, is in <strong>NL</strong>, since we can just nondeterministically guess at each vertex which vertex to visit next in order to discover a path if one exists.</p>

<p>The first nontrivial result for <strong>SL</strong>, however, was <a href="Savitch's_theorem" title="wikilink">Savitch's theorem</a>, proved in 1970, which provided an algorithm that solves USTCON in log<sup>2</sup> <em>n</em> space. Unlike depth-first search, however, this algorithm is impractical for most applications because of its potentially superpolynomial running time. One consequence of this is that USTCON, and so <strong>SL</strong>, is in DSPACE(log<sup>2</sup><em>n</em>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> (Actually, Savitch's theorem gives the stronger result that <strong>NL</strong> is in DSPACE(log<sup>2</sup><em>n</em>).)</p>

<p>Although there were no (uniform) <em>deterministic</em> space improvements on Savitch's algorithm for 22 years, a highly practical probabilistic log-space algorithm was found in 1979 by Aleliunas et al.: simply start at one vertex and perform a random walk until you find the other one (then accept) or until <em>|V|</em><sup>3</sup> time has passed (then reject).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> False rejections are made with a small bounded probability that shrinks exponentially the longer the random walk is continued. This showed that <strong>SL</strong> is contained in <a href="RL_(complexity)" title="wikilink">RLP</a>, the class of problems solvable in polynomial time and logarithmic space with probabilistic machines that reject incorrectly less than 1/3 of the time. By replacing the random walk by a universal traversal sequence, Aleliunas et al. also showed that <strong>SL</strong> is contained in <a class="uri" href="L/poly" title="wikilink">L/poly</a>, a non-uniform complexity class of the problems solvable deterministically in logarithmic space with polynomial <a href="advice_(complexity)" title="wikilink">advice</a>.</p>

<p>In 1989, Borodin et al. strengthened this result by showing that the <a href="complement_(complexity)" title="wikilink">complement</a> of USTCON, determining whether two vertices are in different connected components, is also in <strong>RLP</strong>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> This placed USTCON, and <strong>SL</strong>, in co-<strong>RLP</strong> and in the intersection of <strong>RLP</strong> and co-<strong>RLP</strong>, which is <a class="uri" href="ZPLP" title="wikilink">ZPLP</a>, the class of problems which have log-space, expected polynomial-time, no-error randomized algorithms.</p>

<p>In 1992, <a href="Noam_Nisan" title="wikilink">Nisan</a>, <a href="Endre_Szemerédi" title="wikilink">Szemerédi</a>, and <a href="Avi_Wigderson" title="wikilink">Wigderson</a> finally found a new deterministic algorithm to solve USTCON using only log<sup>1.5</sup> <em>n</em> space.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> This was improved slightly, but there would be no more significant gains until Reingold.</p>

<p>In 1995, Nisan and Ta-Shma showed the surprising result that <strong>SL</strong> is closed under complement, which at the time was believed by many to be false; that is, <strong>SL</strong> = co-<strong>SL</strong>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Equivalently, if a problem can be solved by reducing it to a graph and asking if two vertices are in the <em>same</em> component, it can also be solved by reducing it to another graph and asking if two vertices are in <em>different</em> components. However, Reingold's paper would later make this result redundant.</p>

<p>One of the most important corollaries of <strong>SL</strong> = co-<strong>SL</strong> is that <strong>L</strong><sup><strong>SL</strong></sup> = <strong>SL</strong>; that is, a deterministic, log-space machine with an <a href="oracle_machine" title="wikilink">oracle</a> for <strong>SL</strong> can solve problems in <strong>SL</strong> (trivially) but cannot solve any other problems. This means it does not matter whether we use Turing reducibility or many-one reducibility to show a problem is in <strong>SL</strong>; they are equivalent.</p>

<p>A breakthrough October 2004 paper by <a href="Omer_Reingold" title="wikilink">Omer Reingold</a> showed that USTCON is in fact in <a href="L_(complexity)" title="wikilink">L</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Since USTCON is <strong>SL</strong>-complete, this implies that <strong>SL</strong> = <strong>L</strong>, essentially eliminating the usefulness of consideration of <strong>SL</strong> as a separate class. A few weeks later, graduate student Vladimir Trifonov showed that USTCON could be solved deterministically using O(log <em>n</em> log log <em>n</em>) space—a weaker result—using different techniques.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>==Consequences of L = SL ==</p>

<p>The collapse of <strong>L</strong> and <strong>SL</strong> has a number of significant consequences. Most obviously, all <strong>SL</strong>-complete problems are now in <strong>L</strong>, and can be gainfully employed in the design of deterministic log-space and polylogarithmic-space algorithms. In particular, we have a new set of tools to use in <a href="log-space_reduction" title="wikilink">log-space reductions</a>. It is also now known that a problem is in <strong>L</strong> if and only if it is log-space reducible to USTCON.</p>
