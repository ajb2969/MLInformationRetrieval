<p><strong>Rolling resistance</strong>, sometimes called <strong>rolling friction</strong> or <strong>rolling drag</strong>, is the force resisting the <a href="Motion_(physics)" title="wikilink">motion</a> when a body (such as a <a class="uri" href="ball" title="wikilink">ball</a>, <a class="uri" href="tire" title="wikilink">tire</a>, or <a class="uri" href="wheel" title="wikilink">wheel</a>) rolls on a surface. It is mainly caused by <a href="Plasticity_(physics)" title="wikilink">non-elastic</a> effects; that is, not all the energy needed for deformation (or movement) of the wheel, roadbed, etc. is recovered when the pressure is removed. Two forms of this are hysteresis losses (see <a href="rolling_resistance#Primary_cause" title="wikilink">below</a>), and permanent <a href="plastic_deformation" title="wikilink">(plastic) deformation</a> of the object or the surface (e.g. soil). Another cause of rolling resistance lies in the <a href="frictional_contact_mechanics" title="wikilink">slippage</a> between the wheel and the surface, which dissipates energy. Note that only the last of these effects involves <a class="uri" href="friction" title="wikilink">friction</a>, therefore the name "rolling friction" is to an extent a misnomer.</p>

<p>In analogy with <a href="sliding_friction" title="wikilink">sliding friction</a>, rolling resistance is often expressed as a coefficient times the normal force. This coefficient of rolling resistance is generally much smaller than the coefficient of sliding friction.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Any coasting wheeled <a class="uri" href="vehicle" title="wikilink">vehicle</a> will gradually slow down due to rolling resistance including that of the bearings, but a <a class="uri" href="train" title="wikilink">train</a> car with steel wheels running on steel <a href="Rail_tracks" title="wikilink">rails</a> will roll farther than a <a class="uri" href="bus" title="wikilink">bus</a> of the same mass with rubber tires running on tarmac. Factors that contribute to rolling resistance are the (amount of) deformation of the wheels, the deformation of the roadbed surface, and movement below the surface. Additional contributing factors include <a href="#Depends_on_diameter" title="wikilink">wheel diameter</a>, <a href="#Depends_on_speed" title="wikilink">speed</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <a href="#Depends_on_load" title="wikilink">load on wheel</a>, surface adhesion, sliding, and relative micro-sliding between the surfaces of contact. The losses due to <a class="uri" href="hysteresis" title="wikilink">hysteresis</a> also depend strongly on the material properties of the wheel or tire and the surface. For example, a <a href="tire" title="wikilink">rubber tire</a> will have higher rolling resistance on a paved road than a <a class="uri" href="steel" title="wikilink">steel</a> <a href="Wheelset_(rail_transport)" title="wikilink">railroad wheel</a> on a steel rail. Also, <a class="uri" href="sand" title="wikilink">sand</a> on the ground will give more rolling resistance than <a class="uri" href="concrete" title="wikilink">concrete</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A characteristic of a deformable material such that the energy of deformation is greater than the energy of recovery. The rubber compound in a tire exhibits hysteresis. As the tire rotates under the weight of the vehicle, it experiences repeated cycles of deformation and recovery, and it dissipates the hysteresis energy loss as heat. Hysteresis is the main cause of energy loss associated with rolling resistance and is attributed to the <a href="viscoelasticity" title="wikilink">viscoelastic characteristics</a> of the rubber.</p>

<p>This main principle is illustrated in the figure of the rolling cylinders. If two equal cylinders are pressed together then the contact surface is flat. In the absence of surface friction, contact stresses are normal (i.e. perpendicular) to the contact surface. Consider a particle that enters the contact area at the right side, travels through the contact patch and leaves at the left side. Initially its vertical deformation is increasing, which is resisted by the hysteresis effect. Therefore an additional pressure is generated to avoid interpenetration of the two surfaces. Later its vertical deformation is decreasing. This is again resisted by the hysteresis effect. In this case this decreases the pressure that is needed to keep the two bodies separate.</p>

<p>The resulting pressure distribution is asymmetrical and is shifted to the right. The <a href="line_of_action" title="wikilink">line of action</a> of the (aggregate) <a href="Force#Normal_force" title="wikilink">vertical force</a> no longer passes through the centers of the cylinders. This means that a <a href="moment_(physics)" title="wikilink">moment</a> occurs that tends to retard the rolling motion.</p>

<p>Materials that have a large hysteresis effect, such as rubber, which bounce back slowly, exhibit more rolling resistance than materials with a small hysteresis effect that bounce back more quickly and more completely, such as steel or silica. <a href="Low_rolling_resistance_tires" title="wikilink">Low rolling resistance tires</a> typically incorporate silica in place of carbon black in their tread compounds to reduce low-frequency hysteresis without compromising traction.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Note that railroads also have hysteresis in the roadbed structure.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="rolling-resistance-has-different-definitions">"Rolling resistance" has different definitions</h2>

<p>In the broad sense, specific "rolling resistance" (for vehicles) is the force per unit vehicle weight required to move the vehicle on level ground at a constant slow speed where aerodynamic drag (air resistance) is insignificant and also where there are no traction (motor) forces or brakes applied. In other words the vehicle would be coasting if it were not for the force to maintain constant speed. An example of such usage for railroads is <a href="http://www.istc.illinois.edu/about/SeminarPresentations/20091118.pdf">1</a>. This broad sense includes wheel bearing resistance, the energy dissipated by vibration and oscillation of both the roadbed and the vehicle, and sliding of the wheel on the roadbed surface (pavement or a rail).</p>

<p>But there is an even broader sense which would include energy wasted by wheel slippage due to the <a href="#Depends_on_applied_torque" title="wikilink">torque applied from the engine</a>. This includes the increased power required due to the increased velocity of the wheels where the tangential velocity of the driving wheel(s) becomes greater than the vehicle speed due to slippage. Since <a href="Power_(physics)#Mechanical_power" title="wikilink">power is equal to force times velocity</a> and the wheel velocity has increased, the power required has increased accordingly.</p>

<p>The pure "rolling resistance" for a train is that which happens due to deformation and possible minor sliding at the wheel-road contact.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> For a rubber tire, an analogous energy loss happens over the entire tire, but it is still called "rolling resistance". In the broad sense, "rolling resistance" includes wheel bearing resistance, energy loss by shaking both the roadbed (and the earth underneath) and the vehicle itself, and by sliding of the wheel, road/rail contact. Railroad textbooks seem to cover all these resistance forces but do not call their sum "rolling resistance" (broad sense) as is done in this article. They just sum up all the resistance forces (including aerodynamic drag) and call the sum basic train resistance (or the like).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>Since railroad rolling resistance in the broad sense may be a few times larger than just the pure rolling resistance<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> reported values may be in serious conflict since they may be based on different definitions of "rolling resistance". The train's engines must of course, provide the energy to overcome this broad-sense rolling resistance.</p>

<p>For highway motor vehicles, there is obviously some energy dissipating in the shaking the roadway and earth beneath, shaking of the vehicle itself, and sliding of the tires. But other than the <a href="#Depends_on_applied_torque" title="wikilink">additional power required due to torque</a> and wheel bearing friction, non-pure rolling resistance doesn't seem to have been investigated, possibly because the "pure" rolling resistance of a rubber tire is several times higher than the neglected resistances.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="rolling-resistance-coefficient">Rolling resistance coefficient</h2>

<p>The "rolling resistance coefficient", is defined by the following equation:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

While they are all "specific resistances" sometimes they are just called "resistance" although they are really a coefficient (ratio)or a multiple thereof.

<p>The above equation, where resistance is inversely proportional to radius r. seems to be based on the discredited "Coulomb's law" (Neither Coulomb's inverse square law nor Coulomb's law of friction). See <a href="#Depends_on_diameter" title="wikilink">#Depends on diameter</a>. Equating this equation with the force per the <a href="#Rolling_resistance_coefficient" title="wikilink">#Rolling resistance coefficient</a>, and solving for b, gives b = C<sub>rr</sub>·r. Therefore, if a source gives rolling resistance coefficient (C<sub>rr</sub>) as a dimensionless coefficient, it can be converted to b, having units of length, by multiplying C<sub>rr</sub> by wheel radius r.</p>

<p>"Applied torque" may either be driving torque applied by a motor (often through a <a href="Transmission_(mechanics)" title="wikilink">transmission</a>) or a braking torque applied by <a href="brake" title="wikilink">brakes</a>(including <a href="Regenerative_brake" title="wikilink">regenerative braking</a>). Such torques results in energy dissipation (above that due to the basic rolling resistance of a freely rolling, non-driven, non-braked wheel). This additional loss is in part due to the fact that there is some slipping of the wheel, and for pneumatic tires, there is more flexing of the sidewalls due to the torque. Slip is defined such that a 2% slip means that the circumferential speed of the driving wheel exceeds the speed of the vehicle by 2%.</p>

<p>A small percentage slip can result in a much larger percentage increase in rolling resistance. For example, for pneumatic tires, a 5% slip can translate into a 200% increase in rolling resistance.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> This is partly because the <a href="tractive_force" title="wikilink">tractive force</a> applied during this slip is many times greater than the rolling resistance force and thus much more power per unit velocity is being applied (recall <a href="Power_(physics)#Mechanical_power" title="wikilink">power</a> = force x velocity so that power per unit of velocity is just force). So just a small percentage increase in circumferential velocity due to slip can translate into a loss of traction power which may even exceed the power loss due to basic (ordinary) rolling resistance. For railroads, this effect may be even more pronounced due to the low rolling resistance of steel wheels.</p>
<h3 id="railroad-steel-wheels-torque">Railroad steel wheels (torque)</h3>

<p>In order to apply any <a href="Traction_(engineering)" title="wikilink">traction</a> to the wheels some slippage of the wheel is required.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> For Russian trains climbing up a grade, this slip is normally 1.5% to 2.5%.</p>

<p>Slip (also known as <a href="Rail_adhesion#Forces_on_wheels" title="wikilink">creep</a>)is normally roughly directly proportional to <a href="Tractive_force" title="wikilink">tractive effort</a>. An exception is if the tractive effort is so high that the wheel is close to substantial slipping (more than just a few percent as discussed above), then slip rapidly increases with tractive effort and is no longer linear. With a little higher applied tractive effort the wheel spins out of control and the <a href="Rail_adhesion" title="wikilink">adhesion</a> drops resulting in the wheel spinning even faster. This is the type of slipping that is observable by eye—the slip of say 2% for traction is only observed by instruments. Such rapid slip may result in excessive wear or damage.</p>
<h3 id="pneumatic-tires-torque">Pneumatic tires (torque)</h3>

<p>Rolling resistance greatly increases with applied torque. At high torques, which apply a tangential force to the road of about half the weight of the vehicle, the rolling resistance may triple (a 200% increase).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> This is in part due to a slip of about 5%. See <a href="#All_wheels" title="wikilink">#All wheels</a>| for an explanation of why this is reasonable. The rolling resistance increase with applied torque is not linear, but increases at a faster rate as the torque becomes higher.</p>

<h3 id="railroad-steel-wheels-load">Railroad steel wheels (load)</h3>

<p>The <a href="#Rolling_resistance_coefficient" title="wikilink">#Rolling resistance coefficient</a>, Crr, significantly decreases as the weight of the rail car per wheel increases.<ref>Астахов, Figs. 3.8, 3.9, 3.11, pp. 50-55. Hay, Fig. 60-2, p. 72 shows the same phenomena but has higher values for Crr and not reported here since the railroads in 2011 <a href="http://www.istc.illinois.edu/about/SeminarPresentations/20091118.pdf">3</a>.</ref></p>

<p><code>were claiming about the same value as Астахов</code><code>  For example, an empty Russian freight car had about twice the Crr as loaded car (Crr=0.002 vs. Crr=0.001).  This same "economy of scale" shows up in testing of mine rail cars.</code><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><code>  The theoretical Crr for a rigid wheel rolling on an elastic roadbed shows Crr inversely proportional to the square root of the load.</code><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p>If Crr is itself dependent on wheel load per an inverse square-root rule, then for an increase in load of 2% only a 1% increase in rolling resistance occurs.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="pneumatic-tires-load">Pneumatic tires (load)</h3>

<p>For pneumatic tires, the direction of change in Crr (<a href="#Rolling_resistance_coefficient" title="wikilink">#Rolling resistance coefficient</a>) depends on whether or not tire inflation is increased with increasing load.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> It is reported that if inflation pressure is increased with load according to an (undefined) "schedule", then a 20% increase in load decreases Crr by 3%. But if the inflation pressure is not changed, then a 20% increase in load results in a 4% increase in Crr. Of course this will increase the rolling resistance by 20% due to the increase in load plus 1.2 x 4% due to the increase in Crr resulting in a 24.8% increase in rolling resistance.</p>
<h2 id="depends-on-curvature-of-roadway">Depends on curvature of roadway</h2>
<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<p>When a vehicle (<a href="motor_vehicle" title="wikilink">motor vehicle</a> or railroad <a class="uri" href="train" title="wikilink">train</a>) goes around a curve, rolling resistance usually increases. If the curve is not <a href="Banked_curve#Frictionless_banked_curve" title="wikilink">banked</a> so as to exactly counter the <a href="centrifugal_force" title="wikilink">centrifugal force</a> with an equal and opposing <a href="centripetal_force" title="wikilink">centripetal force</a> due to the banking, then there will be a net unbalanced sideways force on the vehicle. This will result in increased rolling resistance. <a href="Banked_curve" title="wikilink">Banking</a> is also known as <a href="Cant_(road/rail)" title="wikilink">"superelevation" or "cant"</a> (not to be confused with <a href="Cant_(road/rail)#Rail" title="wikilink">rail cant</a> of a <a href="Track_(rail_transport)#Rail" title="wikilink">rail</a>). For railroads, this is called <a href="curve_resistance" title="wikilink">curve resistance</a> but for <a href="road" title="wikilink">roads</a> it has (at least once) been called rolling resistance due to <a href="Cornering_force" title="wikilink">cornering</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sound-effects">Sound effects</h2>

<p>Rolling friction generates sound (vibrational) energy, as mechanical energy is converted to this form of energy due to the friction. One of the most common examples of rolling friction is the movement of <a href="motor_vehicle" title="wikilink">motor vehicle</a> tires on a <a class="uri" href="roadway" title="wikilink">roadway</a>, a process which generates <a href="roadway_noise" title="wikilink">sound</a> as a by-product.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The sound generated by automobile and truck tires as they roll (especially noticeable at highway speeds) is mostly due to the percussion of the tire treads, and compression (and subsequent decompression) of air temporarily captured within the treads.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="factors-that-contribute-in-tires">Factors that contribute in tires</h2>

<p>Several factors affect the magnitude of rolling resistance a tire generates:</p>
<ul>
<li>As mentioned in the introduction: wheel radius, forward speed, surface adhesion, and relative micro-sliding.</li>
<li>Material - different fillers and polymers in tire composition can improve traction while reducing hysteresis. The replacement of some carbon black with higher-priced silica–silane is one common way of reducing rolling resistance.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The use of exotic materials including nano-clay has been shown to reduce rolling resistance in high performance rubber tires.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Solvents may also be used to swell solid tires, decreasing the rolling resistance.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></li>
<li>Dimensions - rolling resistance in tires is related to the flex of sidewalls and the contact area of the tire<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> For example, at the same pressure, wider <a href="bicycle_tire" title="wikilink">bicycle tires</a> flex less in sidewalls as they roll and thus have lower rolling resistance (although higher air resistance).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></li>
<li>Extent of inflation - Lower pressure in tires results in more flexing of sidewalls and higher rolling resistance.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> This energy conversion in the sidewalls increases resistance and can also lead to overheating and may have played a part in the infamous <a href="Ford_Explorer" title="wikilink">Ford Explorer</a> <a href="Firestone_vs_Ford_Motor_Company_controversy" title="wikilink">rollover accidents</a>.</li>
<li>Over inflating tires (such a bicycle tires) may not lower the overall rolling resistance as the tire may skip and hop over the road surface. Traction is sacrificed, and overall rolling friction may not be reduced as the wheel rotational speed changes and slippage increases.</li>
<li>Sidewall deflection is not a direct measurement of rolling friction. A high quality tire with a high quality (and supple) casing will allow for more flex per energy loss than a cheap tire with a stiff sidewall. Again, on a bicycle, a quality tire with a supple casing will still roll easier than a cheap tire with a stiff casing. Similarly, as noted by Goodyear truck tires, a tire with a "fuel saving" casing will benefit the fuel economy through many tread lives (i.e. retreading), while a tire with a "fuel saving" tread design will only benefit until the tread wears down.</li>
<li>In tires, <a class="uri" href="tread" title="wikilink">tread</a> thickness and shape has much to do with rolling resistance. The thicker and more contoured the tread, the higher the rolling resistance<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Thus, the "fastest" bicycle tires have very little tread and heavy duty trucks get the best fuel economy as the tire tread wears out.</li>
<li>Diameter effects seem to be negligible, provided the pavement is hard and the range of diameters is limited. See section<a href="#Depends_on_diameter" title="wikilink">Depends on diameter</a></li>
<li>Virtually all world speed records have been set on relatively narrow wheels, probably because of their aerodynamic advantage at high speed, which is much less important at normal speeds.</li>
<li>Temperature: with both solid and pneumatic tires, rolling resistance has been found to decrease as temperature increases (within a range of temperatures: i.e. there is an upper limit to this effect)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> For a rise in temperature from 30 °C to 70 °C the rolling resistance decreased by 20-25%.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> It is claimed that racers heat their tire before racing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="railroads-components-of-rolling-resistance">Railroads: Components of rolling resistance</h2>

<p>In a broad sense rolling resistance can be defined as the sum of components<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a>):</p>
<ol>
<li>Wheel bearing torque losses.</li>
<li>Pure rolling resistance.</li>
<li>Sliding of the wheel on the rail.</li>
<li>Loss of energy to the roadbed (and earth).</li>
<li>Loss of energy to oscillation of railway rolling stock.</li>
</ol>

<p>Wheel bearing torque losses can be measured as a rolling resistance at the wheel rim, <a href="#Rolling_resistance_coefficient" title="wikilink">Crr</a>. Railroads normally use roller bearings which are either <a href="Rolling-element_bearing#Cylindrical_roller" title="wikilink">cylindrical</a> (Russia)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> or <a href="Rolling-element_bearing#Tapered_roller" title="wikilink">tapered</a> (United States).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The specific rolling resistance in Russian bearings varies with both wheel loading and speed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Wheel bearing rolling resistance is lowest with high axle loads and intermediate speeds of 60–80 km/h with a Crr of 0.00013 (axle load of 21 tonnes). For empty freight cars with axle loads of 5.5 tonnes, Crr goes up to 0.00020 at 60 km/h but at a low speed of 20 km/h it increases to 0.00024 and at a high speed (for freight trains) of 120 km/h it is 0.00028. The Crr obtained above is added to the Crr of the other components to obtain the total Crr for the wheels.</p>
<h2 id="comparing-rolling-resistance-of-highway-vehicles-and-trains">Comparing rolling resistance of highway vehicles and trains</h2>

<p>The rolling resistance of steel wheels on steel rail of a train is far less than that of the rubber tires wheels of an automobile or truck. The weight of trains varies greatly; in some cases they may be much heavier per passenger or per net ton of freight than an automobile or truck, but in other cases they may be much lighter.</p>

<p>As an example of a very heavy passenger train, in 1975 Amtrak passenger trains weighed a little over 7 tonnes per passenger,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> which is much heavier than an average of a little over one ton per passenger for an automobile. This means that for an Amtrak passenger train in 1975, much of the energy savings of the lower rolling resistance was lost to its greater weight.</p>

<p>An example of a very light high-speed passenger train is the <a href="N700_Series_Shinkansen" title="wikilink">N700 Series Shinkansen</a>, which weighs 715 tonnes and carries 1323 passengers, resulting in a per-passenger weight of about half a tonne. This lighter weight per passenger, combined with the lower rolling resistance of steel wheels on steel rail means that an N700 Shinkansen is much more energy efficient than an typical automobile.</p>

<p>In the case of freight, CSX ran an advertisement campaign in 2013 claiming that their freight trains move "a ton of freight 436 miles on a gallon of fuel", whereas some sources claim trucks move a ton of freight about 130 miles per gallon of fuel, indicating trains are more efficient overall.</p>

<li id="fn45">Some think that smaller tire wheels, all else being equal, tend to have higher rolling resistance than larger wheels. In some laboratory tests, however, such as <a href="http://www.legslarry.beerdrinkers.co.uk/tech/GS.htm">Greenspeed test results (accessdate = 2007-10-27)</a>, smaller wheels appeared to have similar or lower losses than large wheels, but these tests were done rolling the wheels against a small-diameter drum, which would theoretically remove the advantage of large-diameter wheels, thus making the tests irrelevant for resolving this issue. Another counter example to the claim of smaller wheels having higher rolling resistance can be found in the area of <a href="Soap_Box_Derby" title="wikilink">ultimate speed</a> soap box derby racing. In this race, the speeds have increased as wheel diameters have decreased by up to 50%. This might suggest that rolling resistance may not be increasing significantly with smaller diameter within a practical range, if any other of the many variables involved have been controlled for.
