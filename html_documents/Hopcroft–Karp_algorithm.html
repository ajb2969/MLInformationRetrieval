<h1>Hopcroft–Karp algorithm</h1>
<hr/>
<p><mtpl></mtpl>In <a href="computer_science" title="wikilink">computer science</a>, the <strong>Hopcroft–Karp algorithm</strong> is an <a class="uri" href="algorithm" title="wikilink">algorithm</a> that takes as input a <a href="bipartite_graph" title="wikilink">bipartite graph</a> and produces as output a maximum <a class="uri" href="cardinality" title="wikilink">cardinality</a> <a href="Matching_(graph_theory)" title="wikilink">matching</a> – a set of as many edges as possible with the property that no two edges share an endpoint. It runs in <span class="LaTeX">$O(|E|\sqrt{|V|})$</span> time in the <a href="worst_case_analysis" title="wikilink">worst case</a>, where <span class="LaTeX">$E$</span> is set of edges in the graph, and <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> is set of vertices of the graph. In the case of <a href="dense_graph" title="wikilink">dense graphs</a> the time bound becomes <span class="LaTeX">$O(|V|^{2.5})$</span>, and for <a href="random_graph" title="wikilink">random graphs</a> it runs in near-linear time.</p>
<p>The algorithm was found by . As in previous methods for matching such as the <a href="Hungarian_algorithm" title="wikilink">Hungarian algorithm</a> and the work of , the Hopcroft–Karp algorithm repeatedly increases the size of a partial matching by finding augmenting paths. However, instead of finding just a single augmenting path per iteration, the algorithm finds a maximal set of shortest augmenting paths. As a result only <span class="LaTeX">$O(\sqrt{n})$</span> iterations are needed. The same principle has also been used to develop more complicated algorithms for non-bipartite matching with the same asymptotic running time as the Hopcroft–Karp algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="augmenting-paths">Augmenting paths</h2>
<p>A vertex that is not the endpoint of an edge in some partial matching <span class="LaTeX">$M$</span> is called a <em>free vertex</em>. The basic concept that the algorithm relies on is that of an <em>augmenting path</em>, a path that starts at a free vertex, ends at a free vertex, and alternates between unmatched and matched edges within the path. Augmented path can have only two vertices (both free) and single unmatched edge between them. Note that except for the endpoints, all other vertices (if any) in augmented path must be non-free vertices.</p>
<p>If <span class="LaTeX">$M$</span> is a matching, and <span class="LaTeX">$P$</span> is an augmenting path relative to <span class="LaTeX">$M$</span>, then the <a href="symmetric_difference" title="wikilink">symmetric difference</a> of the two sets of edges, <span class="LaTeX">$M \oplus P$</span>, would form a matching with size <span class="LaTeX">$|M| + 1$</span>. Thus, by finding augmenting paths, an algorithm may increase the size of the matching.</p>
<p>Conversely, suppose that a matching <span class="LaTeX">$M$</span> is not optimal, and let <span class="LaTeX">$P$</span> be the symmetric difference <span class="LaTeX">$M \oplus M^*$</span> where <span class="LaTeX">$M^*$</span> is an optimal matching. Then <span class="LaTeX">$P$</span> must form a collection of disjoint augmenting paths and cycles or paths in which matched and unmatched edges are of equal number; the difference in size between <span class="LaTeX">$M$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$M^*$</span> is the number of augmenting paths in <span class="LaTeX">$P$</span>. Thus, if no augmenting path can be found, an algorithm may safely terminate, since in this case <span class="LaTeX">$M$</span> must be optimal.</p>
<p>An augmenting path in a matching problem is closely related to the <a href="augmenting_path" title="wikilink">augmenting paths</a> arising in <a href="maximum_flow_problem" title="wikilink">maximum flow problems</a>, paths along which one may increase the amount of flow between the terminals of the flow. It is possible to transform the bipartite matching problem into a maximum flow instance, such that the alternating paths of the matching problem become augmenting paths of the flow problem.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In fact, a generalization of the technique used in Hopcroft–Karp algorithm to arbitrary flow networks is known as <a href="Dinic's_algorithm" title="wikilink">Dinic's algorithm</a>.</p>

<h2 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h2>
<p>Let <span class="LaTeX">$U$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> be the two sets in the bipartition of <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span>, and let the matching from <span class="LaTeX">$U$</span> to <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> at any time be represented as the set <span class="LaTeX">$M$</span>.</p>
<p>The algorithm is run in phases. Each phase consists of the following steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="breadth-first_search" title="wikilink">breadth-first search</a> partitions the vertices of the graph into layers. The free vertices in <span class="LaTeX">$U$</span> are used as the starting vertices of this search and form the first layer of the partitioning. At the first level of the search, there are only unmatched edges, since the free vertices in <span class="LaTeX">$U$</span> are by definition not adjacent to any matched edges. At subsequent levels of the search, the traversed edges are required to alternate between matched and unmatched. That is, when searching for successors from a vertex in <span class="LaTeX">$U$</span>, only unmatched edges may be traversed, while from a vertex in <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> only matched edges may be traversed. The search terminates at the first layer <span class="LaTeX">$k$</span> where one or more free vertices in <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> are reached.</li>
<li>All free vertices in <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> at layer <span class="LaTeX">$k$</span> are collected into a set <span class="LaTeX">$F$</span>. That is, a vertex <span class="LaTeX">$v$</span> is put into <span class="LaTeX">$F$</span> if and only if it ends a shortest augmenting path.</li>
<li>The algorithm finds a maximal set of <em>vertex disjoint</em> augmenting paths of length <span class="LaTeX">$k$</span>. This set may be computed by <a href="depth_first_search" title="wikilink">depth first search</a> from <span class="LaTeX">$F$</span> to the free vertices in <span class="LaTeX">$U$</span>, using the breadth first layering to guide the search: the depth first search is only allowed to follow edges that lead to an unused vertex in the previous layer, and paths in the depth first search tree must alternate between matched and unmatched edges. Once an augmenting path is found that involves one of the vertices in <span class="LaTeX">$F$</span>, the depth first search is continued from the next starting vertex.</li>
<li>Every one of the paths found in this way is used to enlarge <span class="LaTeX">$M$</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The algorithm terminates when no more augmenting paths are found in the breadth first search part of one of the phases.</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>Each phase consists of a single breadth first search and a single depth first search. Thus, a single phase may be implemented in linear time. Therefore, the first <span class="LaTeX">$\sqrt{|V|}$</span> phases, in a graph with <span class="LaTeX">$|V|$</span> vertices and <span class="LaTeX">$|E|$</span> edges, take time <span class="LaTeX">$O(|E|\sqrt{|V|})$</span>.</p>
<p>It can be shown that each phase increases the length of the shortest augmenting path by at least one: the phase finds a maximal set of augmenting paths of the given length, so any remaining augmenting path must be longer. Therefore, once the initial <span class="LaTeX">$\sqrt{|V|}$</span> phases of the algorithm are complete, the shortest remaining augmenting path has at least <span class="LaTeX">$\sqrt{|V|}$</span> edges in it. However, the <a href="symmetric_difference" title="wikilink">symmetric difference</a> of the eventual optimal matching and of the partial matching <em>M</em> found by the initial phases forms a collection of vertex-disjoint augmenting paths and alternating cycles. If each of the paths in this collection has length at least <span class="LaTeX">$\sqrt{|V|}$</span>, there can be at most <span class="LaTeX">$\sqrt{|V|}$</span> paths in the collection, and the size of the optimal matching can differ from the size of <span class="LaTeX">$M$</span> by at most <span class="LaTeX">$\sqrt{|V|}$</span> edges. Since each phase of the algorithm increases the size of the matching by at least one, there can be at most <span class="LaTeX">$\sqrt{|V|}$</span> additional phases before the algorithm terminates.</p>
<p>Since the algorithm performs a total of at most <span class="LaTeX">$2\sqrt{|V|}$</span> phases, it takes a total time of <span class="LaTeX">$O(|E|\sqrt{|V|})$</span> in the worst case.</p>
<p>In many instances, however, the time taken by the algorithm may be even faster than this worst case analysis indicates. For instance, in the <a href="average_case_analysis" title="wikilink">average case</a> for <a href="sparse_graph" title="wikilink">sparse</a> bipartite <a href="random_graph" title="wikilink">random graphs</a>,  (improving a previous result of ) showed that with high probability all non-optimal matchings have augmenting paths of <a href="logarithm" title="wikilink">logarithmic</a> length. As a consequence, for these graphs, the Hopcroft–Karp algorithm takes <span class="LaTeX">$O(\log |V|)$</span> phases and <span class="LaTeX">$O(|E| \log |V|)$</span> total time.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-with-other-bipartite-matching-algorithms">Comparison with other bipartite matching algorithms</h2>
<p>For <a href="sparse_graph" title="wikilink">sparse graphs</a>, the Hopcroft–Karp algorithm continues to have the best known worst-case performance, but for dense graphs a more recent algorithm by  achieves a slightly better time bound, <span class="LaTeX">$O\left(n^{1.5}\sqrt{\frac{m}{\log n}}\right)$</span>. Their algorithm is based on using a <a href="push-relabel_maximum_flow_algorithm" title="wikilink">push-relabel maximum flow algorithm</a> and then, when the matching created by this algorithm becomes close to optimum, switching to the Hopcroft–Karp method.</p>
<p>Several authors have performed experimental comparisons of bipartite matching algorithms. Their results in general tend to show that the Hopcroft–Karp method is not as good in practice as it is in theory: it is outperformed both by simpler breadth-first and depth-first strategies for finding augmenting paths, and by push-relabel techniques.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="non-bipartite-graphs">Non-bipartite graphs</h2>
<p>The same idea of finding a maximal set of shortest augmenting paths works also for finding maximum cardinality matchings in non-bipartite graphs, and for the same reasons the algorithms based on this idea take <span class="LaTeX">$O(\sqrt{|V|})$</span> phases. However, for non-bipartite graphs, the task of finding the augmenting paths within each phase is more difficult. Building on the work of several slower predecessors,  showed how to implement a phase in linear time, resulting in a non-bipartite matching algorithm with the same time bound as the Hopcroft–Karp algorithm for bipartite graphs. The Micali–Vazirani technique is complex, and its authors did not provide full proofs of their results; subsequently, a "clear exposition" was published by  and alternative methods were described by other authors.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In 2012, Vazirani offerred a new simplified proof of the Micali-Vazirani algorithm.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
