<h1>Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems</strong> are a set of results in <a href="general_relativity" title="wikilink">general relativity</a> which attempt to answer the question of when gravitation produces <a href="gravitational_singularity" title="wikilink">singularities</a>.</p>

<p>A singularity in <a href="solutions_of_the_Einstein_field_equations" title="wikilink">solutions of the Einstein field equations</a> is one of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>a situation where matter is forced to be compressed to a point (a space-like singularity)</li>
<li>a situation where certain light rays come from a region with infinite curvature (time-like singularity)</li>
</ol>

<p>Space-like singularities are a feature of <a href="Schwarzschild_metric" title="wikilink">non-rotating uncharged black-holes</a>, while time-like singularities are those that occur in charged or rotating black hole exact solutions. Both of them have the following property:</p>
<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd><strong>geodesic incompleteness</strong>: Some light-paths or particle-paths cannot be extended beyond a certain proper-time or affine-parameter (affine parameter is the null analog of proper time).
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>It is still an open question whether time-like singularities ever occur in the interior of real charged or rotating black holes, or whether they are artifacts of high symmetry and turn into spacelike singularities when realistic perturbations are added.</p>

<p>The <a href="Roger_Penrose" title="wikilink">Penrose</a> theorem guarantees that some sort of <a class="uri" href="geodesic" title="wikilink">geodesic</a> incompleteness occurs inside <em>any</em> <a href="black_hole" title="wikilink">black hole</a>, whenever matter satisfies reasonable <a href="energy_condition" title="wikilink">energy conditions</a> (It does not hold for matter described by a super-field, i.e., the <a href="Dirac_field" title="wikilink">Dirac field</a>). The energy condition required for the black-hole singularity theorem is weak: it says that light rays are always focused together by gravity, never drawn apart, and this holds whenever the energy of matter is non-negative.</p>

<p><a href="Stephen_Hawking" title="wikilink">Hawking</a>'s singularity theorem is for the whole universe, and works backwards in time: in Hawking's original formulation, it guaranteed that the <a href="Big_Bang" title="wikilink">Big Bang</a> has infinite density. Hawking later revised his position in <a href="A_Brief_History_of_Time" title="wikilink">A Brief History of Time</a> (1988) where he stated that "there was in fact no singularity at the beginning of the universe" (p50). This revision followed from quantum mechanics, in which general relativity must break down at times less than the <a href="Planck_time" title="wikilink">Planck time</a>. Hence general relativity cannot be used to show a singularity.</p>

<p>Penrose's theorem is more restricted, it only holds when matter obeys a stronger energy condition, called the <em>dominant energy condition</em>, which means that the energy is bigger than the pressure. All ordinary matter, with the exception of a vacuum expectation value of a <a href="scalar_field" title="wikilink">scalar field</a>, obeys this condition. During <a href="Cosmic_inflation" title="wikilink">inflation</a>, the universe violates the stronger dominant energy condition (but not the weak energy condition), and inflationary cosmologies avoid the initial big-bang singularity, rounding them out to a smooth beginning.</p>
<h2 id="interpretation-and-significance">Interpretation and significance</h2>

<p>In <a href="general_relativity" title="wikilink">general relativity</a>, a singularity is a place that objects or light rays can reach in a finite time where the curvature becomes infinite, or space-time stops being a <a class="uri" href="manifold" title="wikilink">manifold</a>. Singularities can be found in all the black-hole spacetimes, the <a href="Schwarzschild_metric" title="wikilink">Schwarzschild metric</a>, the <a href="Reissner–Nordström_metric" title="wikilink">Reissner–Nordström metric</a>, the <a href="Kerr_metric" title="wikilink">Kerr metric</a> and the <a href="Kerr–Newman_metric" title="wikilink">Kerr–Newman metric</a> and in all cosmological solutions which don't have a scalar field energy or a cosmological constant.</p>

<p>One cannot predict what might come "out" of a big-bang singularity in our past, or what happens to an observer that falls "in" to a black-hole singularity in the future, so they require a modification of physical law. Before Penrose, it was conceivable that singularities only form in contrived situations. For example, in the collapse of a <a class="uri" href="star" title="wikilink">star</a> to form a black hole, if the star is spinning and thus possesses some <a href="angular_momentum" title="wikilink">angular momentum</a>, maybe the <a href="centrifugal_force" title="wikilink">centrifugal force</a> partly counteracts gravity and keeps a singularity from forming. The singularity theorems prove that this cannot happen, and that a singularity will always form once an <a href="event_horizon" title="wikilink">event horizon</a> forms.</p>

<p>In the collapsing star example, since all matter and energy is a source of gravitational attraction in general relativity, the additional angular momentum only pulls the star together more strongly as it contracts: the part outside the event horizon eventually settles down to a <a href="Kerr_black_hole" title="wikilink">Kerr black hole</a> (see <a href="No-hair_theorem" title="wikilink">No-hair theorem</a>). The part inside the event horizon necessarily has a singularity somewhere. The proof is somewhat constructive— it shows that the singularity can be found by following light-rays from a surface just inside the horizon. But the proof does not say what type of singularity occurs, spacelike, timelike, orbifold, jump discontinuity in the metric. It only guarantees that if one follows the time-like geodesics into the future, it is impossible for the boundary of the region they form to be generated by the null geodesics from the surface. This means that the boundary must either come from nowhere or the whole future ends at some finite extension.</p>

<p>An interesting "philosophical" feature of general relativity is revealed by the singularity theorems. Because general relativity predicts the inevitable occurrence of singularities, the theory is not complete without a specification for what happens to matter that hits the singularity. One can extend general relativity to a unified field theory, such as the <a href="Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac_equations" title="wikilink">Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac system</a>, where no such singularities occur.</p>
<h2 id="elements-of-the-theorems">Elements of the theorems</h2>

<p>In mathematics, there is a deep connection between the curvature of a <a class="uri" href="manifold" title="wikilink">manifold</a> and its <a class="uri" href="topology" title="wikilink">topology</a>. The <a href="Bonnet–Myers_theorem" title="wikilink">Bonnet–Myers theorem</a> states that a complete Riemannian manifold which has <a href="Ricci_curvature" title="wikilink">Ricci curvature</a> everywhere greater than a certain positive constant must be <a href="Compact_space" title="wikilink">compact</a>. The condition of positive Ricci curvature is most conveniently stated in the following way: for every geodesic there is a nearby initially parallel geodesic which will bend toward it when extended, and the two will intersect at some finite length.</p>

<p>When two nearby parallel <a href="geodesic" title="wikilink">geodesics</a> intersect, the extension of either one is no longer the shortest path between the endpoints. The reason is that two parallel geodesic paths necessarily collide after an extension of equal length, and if one path is followed to the intersection then the other, you are connecting the endpoints by a non-geodesic path of equal length. This means that for a geodesic to be a shortest length path, it must never intersect neighboring parallel geodesics.</p>

<p>Starting with a small sphere and sending out parallel geodesics from the boundary, assuming that the manifold has a <a href="Ricci_curvature" title="wikilink">Ricci curvature</a> bounded below by a positive constant, none of the geodesics are shortest paths after a while, since they all collide with a neighbor. This means that after a certain amount of extension, all potentially new points have been reached. If all points in a <a href="connected_manifold" title="wikilink">connected manifold</a> are at a finite geodesic distance from a small sphere, the manifold must be compact.</p>

<p><a href="Roger_Penrose" title="wikilink">Penrose</a> argued analogously in relativity. If <a href="null_geodesic" title="wikilink">null geodesics</a>, the paths of <a href="ray_(optics)" title="wikilink">light rays</a>, are followed into the future, points in the future of the region are generated. If a point is on the boundary of the future of the region, it can only be reached by going at the speed of light, no slower, so null geodesics include the entire boundary of the <a href="proper_future" title="wikilink">proper future</a> of a region. When the null geodesics intersect, they are no longer on the boundary of the future, they are in the interior of the future. So, if all the null geodesics collide, there is no boundary to the future.</p>

<p>In relativity, the Ricci curvature, which determines the collision properties of geodesics, is determined by the <a href="Energy-momentum_tensor" title="wikilink">energy tensor</a>, and its projection on light rays is equal to the null-projection of the energy–momentum tensor and is always non-negative. This implies that the volume of a <a href="congruence_(general_relativity)" title="wikilink">congruence</a> of parallel null geodesics once it starts decreasing, will reach zero in a finite time. Once the volume is zero, there is a collapse in some direction, so every geodesic intersects some neighbor.</p>

<p>Penrose concluded that whenever there is a sphere where all the outgoing (and ingoing) light rays are initially converging, the boundary of the future of that region will end after a finite extension, because all the null geodesics will converge.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> This is significant, because the outgoing light rays for any sphere inside the horizon of a <a href="black_hole" title="wikilink">black hole</a> solution are all converging, so the boundary of the future of this region is either compact or comes from nowhere. The future of the interior either ends after a finite extension, or has a boundary which is eventually generated by new light rays which cannot be traced back to the original sphere.</p>
<h2 id="nature-of-a-singularity">Nature of a singularity</h2>

<p>The singularity theorems use the notion of <a href="geodesically_incomplete" title="wikilink">geodesic incompleteness</a> as a stand-in for the presence of infinite curvatures. Geodesic incompleteness is the notion that there are <a href="geodesic" title="wikilink">geodesics</a>, paths of observers through spacetime, that can only be extended for a finite time as measured by an observer traveling along one. Presumably, at the end of the geodesic the observer has fallen into a singularity or encountered some other pathology at which the laws of general relativity break down.</p>
<h3 id="assumptions-of-the-theorems">Assumptions of the theorems</h3>

<p>Typically a singularity theorem has three ingredients:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li>An <a href="energy_conditions" title="wikilink">energy condition</a> on the matter,</li>
<li>A condition on the <a href="global_spacetime_structure" title="wikilink">global structure of spacetime</a>,</li>
<li>Gravity is strong enough (somewhere) to trap a region.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are various possibilities for each ingredient, and each leads to different singularity theorems.</p>
<h3 id="tools-employed">Tools employed</h3>

<p>A key tool used in the formulation and proof of the singularity theorems is the <a href="Raychaudhuri_equation" title="wikilink">Raychaudhuri equation</a>, which describes the divergence

<p>In <a href="general_relativity" title="wikilink">general relativity</a>, there are several versions of the <strong>Penrose–Hawking singularity theorem</strong>. Most versions state, roughly, that if there is a <a href="trapped_null_surface" title="wikilink">trapped null surface</a> and the <a href="Stress–energy_tensor" title="wikilink">energy density</a> is nonnegative, then there exist <a href="geodesic" title="wikilink">geodesics</a> of finite length which can't be extended.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>These theorems, strictly speaking, prove that there is at least one non-spacelike geodesic that is only finitely extendible into the past but there are cases in which the conditions of these theorems obtain in such a way that all past-directed spacetime paths terminate at a singularity.</p>

For instance, the boundary of the future of two spacelike separated points is the union of two future light cones with the interior parts of the intersection removed. Caustics occur where the light cones intersect, but no singularity lies there.) However, the null geodesics generating
