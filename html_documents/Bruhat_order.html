<h1>Bruhat order</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In mathematics, the <strong>Bruhat order</strong> (also called <strong>strong order</strong> or <strong>strong Bruhat order</strong> or <strong>Chevalley order</strong> or <strong>Bruhat–Chevalley order</strong> or <strong>Chevalley–Bruhat order</strong>) is a partial order on the elements of a <a href="Coxeter_group" title="wikilink">Coxeter group</a>, that corresponds to the inclusion order on <a href="Schubert_varieties" title="wikilink">Schubert varieties</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The Bruhat order on the Schubert varieties of a flag manifold or Grassmannian was first studied by , and the analogue for more general semisimple algebraic groups was studied by .  started the combinatorial study of the Bruhat order on the Weyl group, and introduced the name "Bruhat order" because of the relation to the <a href="Bruhat_decomposition" title="wikilink">Bruhat decomposition</a> introduced by <a href="François_Bruhat" title="wikilink">François Bruhat</a>.</p>

<p>The left and right weak Bruhat orderings were studied by .</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>

<p>If (<em>W</em>,<em>S</em>) is a <a href="Coxeter_system" title="wikilink">Coxeter system</a> with generators <em>S</em>, then the Bruhat order is a partial order on the group <em>W</em>. Recall that a reduced word for an element <em>w</em> of <em>W</em> is a minimal length expression of <em>w</em> as a product of elements of <em>S</em>, and the length <em>l</em>(<em>w</em>) of <em>w</em> is the length of a reduced word.</p>
<ul>
<li>The (strong) Bruhat order is defined by <em>u</em>≤<em>v</em> if some substring of some (or every) reduced word for <em>v</em> is a reduced word for <em>u</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(Note that here a substring is not necessarily a consecutive substring.)</p>
<ul>
<li>The weak left (Bruhat) order is defined by <em>u</em>≤<sub><em>L</em></sub><em>v</em> if some final substring of some reduced word for <em>v</em> is a reduced word for <em>u</em>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The weak right (Bruhat) order is defined by <em>u</em>≤<sub><em>R</em></sub><em>v</em> if some initial substring of some reduced word for <em>v</em> is a reduced word for <em>u</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more on the weak orders, see the article <a href="weak_order_of_permutations" title="wikilink">weak order of permutations</a>.</p>
<h2 id="bruhat-graph">Bruhat graph</h2>

<p>The Bruhat graph is a directed graph related to the (strong) Bruhat order. The vertex set is the set of elements of the Coxeter group and the edge set consists of directed edges (<em>u</em>, <em>v</em>) whenever <em>u</em> = <em>t</em> <em>v</em> for some reflection <em>t</em> and <em>l</em>(<em>u</em>) \mu(\pi,\sigma)=(-1)^{\ell(\sigma)-\ell(\pi)}, and thus this poset is Eulerian, meaning its Möbius function is produced by the rank function on the poset.</p>
