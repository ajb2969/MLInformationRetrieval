<h1>Microfluidics</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Microfluidics</strong> is a multidisciplinary field intersecting engineering, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, nanotechnology, and biotechnology, with practical applications to the design of systems in which small volumes of fluids are handled. Microfluidics emerged in the beginning of the 1980s and is used in the development of inkjet printheads, DNA chips, <a class="uri" href="lab-on-a-chip" title="wikilink">lab-on-a-chip</a> technology, micro-propulsion, and micro-thermal technologies. It deals with the behavior, precise control and manipulation of <a class="uri" href="fluids" title="wikilink">fluids</a> that are geometrically constrained to a small, typically sub-millimeter, scale. Typically, <strong>micro</strong> means one of the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>small volumes (µL, nL, pL, fL)</li>
<li>small size</li>
<li>low energy consumption</li>
<li>effects of the micro domain</li>
</ul>

<p>Typically fluids are moved, mixed, separated or otherwise processed. Numerous applications employ passive fluid control techniques like capillary forces. In some applications external actuation means are additionally used for a directed transport of the media. Examples are rotary drives applying centrifugal forces for the fluid transport on the passive chips. <strong>Active microfluidics</strong> refers to the defined manipulation of the working fluid by active (micro) components such as <a href="micropump" title="wikilink">micropumps</a> or micro valves. Micro pumps supply fluids in a continuous manner or are used for dosing. Micro valves determine the flow direction or the mode of movement of pumped liquids. Often processes which are normally carried out in a lab are miniaturized on a single chip in order to enhance efficiency and mobility as well as reducing sample and reagent volumes.</p>
<h2 id="microscale-behavior-of-fluids">Microscale behavior of fluids</h2>

<p> The behavior of fluids at the microscale can differ from 'macrofluidic' behavior in that factors such as <a href="surface_tension" title="wikilink">surface tension</a>, energy dissipation, and fluidic resistance start to dominate the system. Microfluidics studies how these behaviors change, and how they can be worked around, or exploited for new uses.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>At small scales (channel diameters of around 100 <a class="uri" href="nanometers" title="wikilink">nanometers</a> to several hundred <a class="uri" href="micrometers" title="wikilink">micrometers</a>) some interesting and sometimes unintuitive properties appear. In particular, the <a href="Reynolds_number" title="wikilink">Reynolds number</a> (which compares the effect of momentum of a fluid to the effect of <a class="uri" href="viscosity" title="wikilink">viscosity</a>) can become very low. A key consequence of this is that fluids, when side-by-side, do not necessarily mix in the traditional sense, as flow becomes <a href="laminar_flow" title="wikilink">laminar</a> rather than <a href="turbulent_flow" title="wikilink">turbulent</a>; molecular transport between them must often be through <a class="uri" href="diffusion" title="wikilink">diffusion</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>High specificity of chemical and physical properties (concentration, pH, temperature, shear force, etc.) can also be ensured resulting in more uniform reaction conditions and higher grade products in single and multi-step reactions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="key-application-areas">Key application areas</h2>

<p>Microfluidic structures include micropneumatic systems, i.e. microsystems for the handling of off-chip fluids (liquid pumps, gas valves, etc.), and microfluidic structures for the on-chip handling of nano- and picolitre volumes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> To date, the most successful commercial application of microfluidics is the <a href="Inkjet_printer" title="wikilink">inkjet printhead</a>. Significant research has also been applied to microfluidic synthesis and production of various biofunctionalized nanoparticles including <a href="quantum_dot" title="wikilink">quantum dots</a> (QDs) and metallic nanoparticles,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and other industrially relevant materials (e.g., polymer particles).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Additionally, advances in microfluidic manufacturing allow the devices to produced in low-cost plastics<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and part quality may be verified automatically.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

</figure>

<p>Advances in microfluidics technology are revolutionizing <a href="molecular_biology" title="wikilink">molecular biology</a> procedures for enzymatic analysis (e.g., <a class="uri" href="glucose" title="wikilink">glucose</a> and <a href="lactic_acid" title="wikilink">lactate</a> <a class="uri" href="assays" title="wikilink">assays</a>), <a class="uri" href="DNA" title="wikilink">DNA</a> analysis (e.g., <a href="polymerase_chain_reaction" title="wikilink">polymerase chain reaction</a> and high-throughput <a class="uri" href="sequencing" title="wikilink">sequencing</a>), and <a class="uri" href="proteomics" title="wikilink">proteomics</a>. The basic idea of microfluidic biochips is to integrate <a class="uri" href="assay" title="wikilink">assay</a> operations such as detection, as well as sample pre-treatment and sample preparation on one chip.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>An emerging application area for biochips is <a href="clinical_pathology" title="wikilink">clinical pathology</a>, especially the immediate point-of-care diagnosis of <a class="uri" href="diseases" title="wikilink">diseases</a>. In addition, microfluidics-based devices, capable of continuous sampling and real-time testing of air/water samples for biochemical <a class="uri" href="toxins" title="wikilink">toxins</a> and other dangerous <a class="uri" href="pathogens" title="wikilink">pathogens</a>, can serve as an always-on <a href="smoke_alarm" title="wikilink">"bio-smoke alarm"</a> for early warning.</p>
<h3 id="continuous-flow-microfluidics">Continuous-flow microfluidics</h3>

<p>These technologies are based on the manipulation of continuous <a href="steady_flow" title="wikilink">liquid flow</a> through microfabricated channels. Actuation of <a href="steady_flow" title="wikilink">liquid flow</a> is implemented either by external <a class="uri" href="pressure" title="wikilink">pressure</a> sources, external mechanical <a href="pump" title="wikilink">pumps</a>, integrated mechanical <a href="micropump" title="wikilink">micropumps</a>, or by combinations of capillary forces and <a class="uri" href="electrokinetic" title="wikilink">electrokinetic</a> mechanisms.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Continuous-flow microfluidic operation is the mainstream approach because it is easy to implement and less sensitive to protein fouling problems. Continuous-flow devices are adequate for many well-defined and simple biochemical applications, and for certain tasks such as chemical separation, but they are less suitable for tasks requiring a high degree of flexibility or ineffect fluid manipulations. These closed-channel systems are inherently difficult to integrate and scale because the parameters that govern flow field vary along the flow path making the fluid flow at any one location dependent on the properties of the entire system. Permanently etched microstructures also lead to limited reconfigurability and poor fault tolerance capability.</p>

<p>Process monitoring capabilities in continuous-flow systems can be achieved with highly sensitive microfluidic flow sensors based on <a href="Microelectromechanical_systems" title="wikilink">MEMS</a> technology which offer resolutions down to the nanoliter range.</p>
<h3 id="droplet-based-microfluidics">Droplet-based microfluidics</h3>

<p>Droplet-based microfluidics as a subcategory of microfluidics in contrast with continuous microfluidics has the distinction of manipulating discrete volumes of fluids in immiscible phases with low Reynolds number and laminar flow regimes. Interest in droplet-based microfluidics systems has been growing substantially in past decades. Microdroplets offer the feasibility of handling miniature volumes of fluids conveniently, provide better mixing and are suitable for high throughput experiments.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Exploiting the benefits of droplet based microfluidics efficiently requires a deep understanding of droplet generation,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> droplet motion, droplet merging, and droplet breakup<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>One of the key advantages of droplet-based microfluidics is the ability to use droplets as incubators for single cells.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p>Devices capable of generating thousands of droplets per second opens new ways characterize cell population, not only based on a specific marker measured at a specific time point, but also based on cells kinetic behavior such as protein secretion, enzyme activity or proliferation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Recently, a method was found to generate a stationary array of microscopic droplets for single-cell incubation that does not require the use of a surfactant .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="digital-microfluidics">Digital microfluidics</h3>

<p>Alternatives to the above closed-channel continuous-flow systems include novel open structures, where discrete, independently controllable droplets are manipulated on a substrate using <a class="uri" href="electrowetting" title="wikilink">electrowetting</a>. Following the analogy of digital microelectronics, this approach is referred to as <a href="digital_microfluidics" title="wikilink">digital microfluidics</a>. Le Pesant et al. pioneered the use of electrocapillary forces to move droplets on a digital track.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The "fluid transistor" pioneered by <a class="uri" href="Cytonix" title="wikilink">Cytonix</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> also played a role. The technology was subsequently commercialized by Duke University. By using discrete unit-volume droplets,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> a microfluidic function can be reduced to a set of repeated basic operations, i.e., moving one unit of fluid over one unit of distance. This "digitization" method facilitates the use of a hierarchical and cell-based approach for microfluidic biochip design. Therefore, digital microfluidics offers a flexible and scalable system architecture as well as high <a class="uri" href="fault-tolerance" title="wikilink">fault-tolerance</a> capability. Moreover, because each droplet can be controlled independently, these systems also have dynamic reconfigurability, whereby groups of unit cells in a microfluidic array can be reconfigured to change their functionality during the concurrent execution of a set of bioassays. Although droplets are manipulated in confined microfluidic channels, since the control on droplets is not independent, it should not be confused as "digital microfluidics". One common actuation method for digital microfluidics is <a class="uri" href="electrowetting" title="wikilink">electrowetting</a>-on-dielectric (EWOD). Many lab-on-a-chip applications have been demonstrated within the digital microfluidics paradigm using electrowetting. However, recently other techniques for droplet manipulation have also been demonstrated using <a href="surface_acoustic_wave" title="wikilink">surface acoustic waves</a>, <a class="uri" href="optoelectrowetting" title="wikilink">optoelectrowetting</a>, mechanical actuation,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> etc.</p>
<h3 id="dna-chips-microarrays">DNA chips (microarrays)</h3>

<p>Early biochips were based on the idea of a <a href="DNA_microarray" title="wikilink">DNA microarray</a>, e.g., the GeneChip DNAarray from <a class="uri" href="Affymetrix" title="wikilink">Affymetrix</a>, which is a piece of glass, plastic or silicon substrate on which pieces of DNA (probes) are affixed in a microscopic array. Similar to a <a href="DNA_microarray" title="wikilink">DNA microarray</a>, a <a href="protein_array" title="wikilink">protein array</a> is a miniature array where a multitude of different capture agents, most frequently monoclonal <a class="uri" href="antibodies" title="wikilink">antibodies</a>, are deposited on a chip surface; they are used to determine the presence and/or amount of <a href="protein" title="wikilink">proteins</a> in biological samples, e.g., <a class="uri" href="blood" title="wikilink">blood</a>. A drawback of <a class="uri" href="DNA" title="wikilink">DNA</a> and <a href="protein_array" title="wikilink">protein arrays</a> is that they are neither reconfigurable nor <a class="uri" href="scalable" title="wikilink">scalable</a> after manufacture. <a href="Digital_microfluidics" title="wikilink">Digital microfluidics</a> has been described as a means for carrying out <a href="Digital_PCR" title="wikilink">Digital PCR</a>.</p>
<h3 id="molecular-biology">Molecular biology</h3>

<p>In addition to microarrays, biochips have been designed for two-dimensional <a class="uri" href="electrophoresis" title="wikilink">electrophoresis</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> <a class="uri" href="transcriptome" title="wikilink">transcriptome</a> analysis,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and <a class="uri" href="PCR" title="wikilink">PCR</a> amplification.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Other applications include various electrophoresis and <a href="liquid_chromatography" title="wikilink">liquid chromatography</a> applications for proteins and <a class="uri" href="DNA" title="wikilink">DNA</a>, cell separation, in particular blood cell separation, protein analysis, cell manipulation and analysis including cell viability analysis <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> and <a class="uri" href="microorganism" title="wikilink">microorganism</a> capturing.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>By combining microfluidics with <a href="landscape_ecology" title="wikilink">landscape ecology</a> and <a class="uri" href="nanofluidics" title="wikilink">nanofluidics</a>, a nano/micro fabricated fluidic landscape can be constructed by building local patches of <a class="uri" href="bacterial" title="wikilink">bacterial</a> <a class="uri" href="habitat" title="wikilink">habitat</a> and connecting them by dispersal corridors. The resulting landscapes can be used as physical implementations of an <a href="adaptive_landscape" title="wikilink">adaptive landscape</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> by generating a spatial mosaic of patches of opportunity distributed in space and time. The patchy nature of these fluidic landscapes allows for the study of adapting bacterial cells in a <a class="uri" href="metapopulation" title="wikilink">metapopulation</a> system. The <a href="evolutionary_ecology" title="wikilink">evolutionary ecology</a> of these bacterial systems in these synthetic ecosystems allows for using <a class="uri" href="biophysics" title="wikilink">biophysics</a> to address questions in <a href="evolutionary_biology" title="wikilink">evolutionary biology</a>.</p>
<h3 id="cell-behavior">Cell behavior</h3>

<p>The ability to create precise and carefully controlled <a class="uri" href="chemoattractant" title="wikilink">chemoattractant</a> gradients makes microfluidics the ideal tool to study motility, <a class="uri" href="chemotaxis" title="wikilink">chemotaxis</a> and the ability to evolve / develop resistance to antibiotics in small populations of microorganisms and in a short period of time. These microorganisms including <a class="uri" href="bacteria" title="wikilink">bacteria</a> <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> and the broad range of organisms that form the marine <a href="microbial_loop" title="wikilink">microbial loop</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> responsible for regulating much of the oceans' biogeochemistry.</p>

<p>Microfluidics has also greatly aided the study of <a class="uri" href="durotaxis" title="wikilink">durotaxis</a> by facilitating the creation of durotactic (stiffness) gradients.</p>

<p>By rectifying the motion of individual swimming bacteria,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> microfluidic structures can be used to extract mechanical motion from a population of motile bacterial cells.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> This way, bacteria-powered rotors can be built.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="optics">Optics</h3>

<p>The merger of microfluidics and optics is typical known as <a class="uri" href="optofluidics" title="wikilink">optofluidics</a>. Examples of optofluidic devices are tuneable microlens arrays<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> and optofluidic microscopes.</p>

<p>Microfluidic flow enables fast sample throughput, automated imaging of large sample populations, as well as 3D capabilities.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> or superresolution.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="acoustic-droplet-ejection-ade">Acoustic droplet ejection (ADE)</h3>

<p><a href="Acoustic_droplet_ejection" title="wikilink">Acoustic droplet ejection</a> uses a pulse of <a class="uri" href="ultrasound" title="wikilink">ultrasound</a> to move low volumes of <a class="uri" href="fluids" title="wikilink">fluids</a> (typically nanoliters or picoliters) without any physical contact. This technology focuses acoustic energy into a fluid sample in order to eject droplets as small as a millionth of a millionth of a liter (picoliter = 10<sup>−12</sup> liter). ADE technology is a very gentle process, and it can be used to transfer proteins, high molecular weight DNA and live cells without damage or loss of viability. This feature makes the technology suitable for a wide variety of applications including <a class="uri" href="proteomics" title="wikilink">proteomics</a> and cell-based assays.</p>
<h3 id="fuel-cells">Fuel cells</h3>

<p>Microfluidic <a href="fuel_cells" title="wikilink">fuel cells</a> can use laminar flow to separate the fuel and its oxidant to control the interaction of the two fluids without a physical barrier as would be required in conventional fuel cells.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
