<h1>Acey Deucey (card game)</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Acey Deucey</strong>, also known as <strong><em>In-Between</em></strong> or <strong><em>Sheets</em></strong>, is a simple <a href="card_game" title="wikilink">card game</a> that involves betting.</p>
<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>

<p>Before the action, each player must add their <a href="Betting_in_poker#Ante" title="wikilink">ante</a> into the pot. Two cards are then dealt face-up to one player. That player then bets from nothing to the amount that is in the pot at the time whether or not the third card will numerically fall in between the first two. If the third card falls in between the two other cards, the bettor takes the amount he bet out of the pot; if the third card falls outside of the two other cards, the bettor must add what he bet to the pot; and if the third card matches the numerical value of one of the other two cards, the bettor must add to the pot double what he bet. If two cards of the same value come up, e.g. 2,2 the bettor picks if the next card will be higher or lower and bets. If the next card is the same as the last two, i.e. a 2, the bettor must triple his/her bet.</p>
<h3 id="regionally-specific-rules">Regionally specific rules</h3>

<p>The rules and specifics of the game often vary from region to region. For example in <a href="Liaoning_province" title="wikilink">Liaoning province</a>, northeast China the minimum number of players is 4 and each player is required to ante before the first card is turned. Two cards are then dealt face-up to one player. That player then bets from nothing to the amount that is in the pot at the time (during the first time around the table players are only allowed to bet up to half of the pot) whether or not the third card will numerically fall in between the first two. Other regions, such as in the United States, play the game by combining two decks of cards. This adds another dynamic to the game due to the extra number of similar type cards. Beyond that, most of the other rules followed by United States players are similar to those which are observed in the Liaoning province.</p>

<p>Just about all regions play if the third card falls in between the two other cards, the bettor takes the amount he bet out of the pot; if the third card falls outside of the two other cards, the bettor must add what he bet to the pot; and if the third card matches the numerical value of one of the other two cards, this is referred to as a "Post" and the bettor must add to the pot double his initial bet. If two cards of the same value come up, e.g. 2,2 the bettor picks if the next card will be higher or lower and bets. If the next card is the same as the last two, i.e. a 2, this is considered a "Post" and the player is required to pay triple the bet for the hand.</p>
<h3 id="aces">Aces</h3>

<p>In addition to this, there is a special rule for <a href="Ace_(card)" title="wikilink">Aces</a>. If the first card turned is an Ace the player may choose its value as either the high Ace or the low one. Low Ace is always lower than any other card, including the deuce. If an Ace comes up as the second card turned it is always considered the high Ace. If a player "Posts" on an Ace they are required to pay four times their bet for that hand. Aces also cause an automatic loss if it is the third card turned when the first two cards are a match, e.g. 6,6. The best spread in the game is considered to be a low Ace on the left and a high Ace on the right. This is also one of the worst <a href="Hand_(card_games)" title="wikilink">hands</a> to get as you run the risk of the third card being an Ace and having to pay four times your bet for the hand.</p>
<h2 id="strategy">Strategy</h2>

<p>Players attempting to middle two posts with a spread of less than 8 will show a long term loss. (Where

<h2 id="variations">Variations</h2>

<p>A variation is to split the cards if two end cards are the same value. This requires the bettor to ante in for two hands and the dealer would draw one more card under each of the end cards. After this, the same rules apply.</p>

<p>Some new rules that increase payouts and betting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blind Pot - Bet the pot before your 2 outside cards are placed. In the case of a win, you win the pot. If you are outside of your cards you lose half the pot. If you post you have to pay the full amount of the pot.</li>
<li>"AutoPot" - Any A-2 played as your outside cards automatically make the player bet the full amount of the pot.</li>
<li>Post Bet - You can bet that your inside card will match one of your outside cards. In the case of this you win the full pot and in addition each player pays an equal percentage to match the pot. Therefore, the player that post would win 2x the pot. If the player bets the post and misses he owes half the amount of the pot to the pot.</li>
<li>Satan 6s - Any player that gets 6-6-6 as their cards must pay 6x the amount of the pot to the pot.</li>
