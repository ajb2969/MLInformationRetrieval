<h1>Archimedes</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Archimedes of Syracuse</strong> (;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> ;  BC –  BC) was an <a href="Ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">Ancient Greek</a> <a href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematician</a>, <a href="physics" title="wikilink">physicist</a>, <a href="engineering" title="wikilink">engineer</a>, <a class="uri" href="inventor" title="wikilink">inventor</a>, and <a href="astronomy" title="wikilink">astronomer</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Although few details of his life are known, he is regarded as one of the leading <a href="scientist" title="wikilink">scientists</a> in <a href="classical_antiquity" title="wikilink">classical antiquity</a>.</p>

He was also one of the first to apply mathematics to physical phenomena, founding <a href="Fluid_statics" title="wikilink">hydrostatics</a> and <a class="uri" href="statics" title="wikilink">statics</a>, including an explanation of the principle of the <a class="uri" href="lever" title="wikilink">lever</a>. He is credited with designing innovative <a href="machine" title="wikilink">machines</a>, such as his <a href="Archimedes'_screw" title="wikilink">screw pump</a>, <a href="block_and_tackle" title="wikilink">compound pulleys</a>, and defensive war machines to protect his native <a href="Syracuse,_Sicily" title="wikilink">Syracuse</a> from invasion.</p>

<p>Archimedes died during the <a href="Siege_of_Syracuse_(214–212_BC)" title="wikilink">Siege of Syracuse</a> when he was killed by a <a href="Roman_Republic" title="wikilink">Roman</a> soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed. <a class="uri" href="Cicero" title="wikilink">Cicero</a> describes visiting the tomb of Archimedes, which was surmounted by a <a class="uri" href="sphere" title="wikilink">sphere</a> and a <a href="cylinder_(geometry)" title="wikilink">cylinder</a>, which Archimedes had requested to be placed on his tomb, representing his mathematical discoveries.</p>

<p>Unlike his inventions, the mathematical writings of Archimedes were little known in antiquity. Mathematicians from <a class="uri" href="Alexandria" title="wikilink">Alexandria</a> read and quoted him, but the first comprehensive compilation was not made until <em>c.</em> 530 AD by <a href="Isidore_of_Miletus" title="wikilink">Isidore of Miletus</a> in <a class="uri" href="Byzantine" title="wikilink">Byzantine</a> Constantinople, while commentaries on the works of Archimedes written by <a href="Eutocius_of_Ascalon" title="wikilink">Eutocius</a> in the sixth century AD opened them to wider readership for the first time. The relatively few copies of Archimedes' written work that survived through the <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a> were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the <a class="uri" href="Renaissance" title="wikilink">Renaissance</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> while the discovery in 1906 of previously unknown works by Archimedes in the <a href="Archimedes_Palimpsest" title="wikilink">Archimedes Palimpsest</a> has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>

<p>Archimedes was born <em>c</em>. 287 BC in the seaport city of <a href="Syracuse,_Sicily" title="wikilink">Syracuse, Sicily</a>, at that time a self-governing <a href="Colonies_in_antiquity" title="wikilink">colony</a> in <a href="Magna_Graecia" title="wikilink">Magna Graecia</a>, located along the coast of <a href="Southern_Italy" title="wikilink">Southern Italy</a>. The date of birth is based on a statement by the <a href="Byzantine_Greeks" title="wikilink">Byzantine Greek</a> historian <a href="John_Tzetzes" title="wikilink">John Tzetzes</a> that Archimedes lived for 75 years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In <em><a href="The_Sand_Reckoner" title="wikilink">The Sand Reckoner</a></em>, Archimedes gives his father's name as Phidias, an <a class="uri" href="astronomer" title="wikilink">astronomer</a> about whom nothing is known. <a class="uri" href="Plutarch" title="wikilink">Plutarch</a> wrote in his <em><a href="Parallel_Lives" title="wikilink">Parallel Lives</a></em> that Archimedes was related to King <a href="Hiero_II_of_Syracuse" title="wikilink">Hiero II</a>, the ruler of Syracuse.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> A biography of Archimedes was written by his friend Heracleides but this work has been lost, leaving the details of his life obscure.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> It is unknown, for instance, whether he ever married or had children. During his youth, Archimedes may have studied in <a class="uri" href="Alexandria" title="wikilink">Alexandria</a>, <a href="Ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">Egypt</a>, where <a href="Conon_of_Samos" title="wikilink">Conon of Samos</a> and <a href="Eratosthenes" title="wikilink">Eratosthenes of Cyrene</a> were contemporaries. He referred to Conon of Samos as his friend, while two of his works (<em><a href="Archimedes'_use_of_infinitesimals" title="wikilink">The Method of Mechanical Theorems</a></em> and the <em><a href="Archimedes'_cattle_problem" title="wikilink">Cattle Problem</a></em>) have introductions addressed to Eratosthenes.</p>

<p>Archimedes died <em>c</em>. 212 BC during the <a href="Second_Punic_War" title="wikilink">Second Punic War</a>, when Roman forces under General <a href="Marcus_Claudius_Marcellus" title="wikilink">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</a> captured the city of Syracuse after a two-year-long <a class="uri" href="siege" title="wikilink">siege</a>. According to the popular account given by <a class="uri" href="Plutarch" title="wikilink">Plutarch</a>, Archimedes was contemplating a <a href="mathematical_diagram" title="wikilink">mathematical diagram</a> when the city was captured. A Roman soldier commanded him to come and meet General Marcellus but he declined, saying that he had to finish working on the problem. The soldier was enraged by this, and killed Archimedes with his sword. Plutarch also gives a  account of the death of Archimedes which suggests that he may have been killed while attempting to surrender to a Roman soldier. According to this story, Archimedes was carrying mathematical instruments, and was killed because the soldier thought that they were valuable items. General Marcellus was reportedly angered by the death of Archimedes, as he considered him a valuable scientific asset and had ordered that he not be harmed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Marcellus called Archimedes "a geometrical <a href="Hekatonkheires" title="wikilink">Briareus</a>".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p> The last words attributed to Archimedes are "Do not disturb my circles", a reference to the circles in the mathematical drawing that he was supposedly studying when disturbed by the Roman soldier. This quote is often given in <a class="uri" href="Latin" title="wikilink">Latin</a> as "<em><a href="Noli_turbare_circulos_meos" title="wikilink">Noli turbare circulos meos</a></em>," but there is no reliable evidence that Archimedes uttered these words and they do not appear in the account given by Plutarch. <a href="Valerius_Maximus" title="wikilink">Valerius Maximus</a>, writing in <em>Memorable Doings and Sayings</em> in the 1st century AD, gives the phrase as "<em>...sed protecto manibus puluere 'noli' inquit, 'obsecro, istum disturbare</em>'" - "... but protecting the dust with his hands, said 'I beg of you, do not disturb this.{{'"}} The phrase is also given in <a href="Katharevousa_Greek" title="wikilink">Katharevousa Greek</a> as "μὴ μου τοὺς κύκλους τάραττε!" ().<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>The tomb of Archimedes carried a sculpture illustrating his favorite mathematical proof, consisting of a <a class="uri" href="sphere" title="wikilink">sphere</a> and a <a href="cylinder_(geometry)" title="wikilink">cylinder</a> of the same height and diameter. Archimedes had proven that the volume and surface area of the sphere are two thirds that of the cylinder including its bases. In 75 BC, 137 years after his death, the Roman <a class="uri" href="orator" title="wikilink">orator</a> <a class="uri" href="Cicero" title="wikilink">Cicero</a> was serving as <a class="uri" href="quaestor" title="wikilink">quaestor</a> in <a class="uri" href="Sicily" title="wikilink">Sicily</a>. He had heard stories about the tomb of Archimedes, but none of the locals was able to give him the location. Eventually he found the tomb near the Agrigentine gate in Syracuse, in a neglected condition and overgrown with bushes. Cicero had the tomb cleaned up, and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> A tomb discovered in the courtyard of the Hotel Panorama in Syracuse in the early 1960s was claimed to be that of Archimedes, but there was no compelling evidence for this and the location of his tomb today is unknown.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>The standard versions of the life of Archimedes were written long after his death by the historians of Ancient Rome. The account of the siege of Syracuse given by <a class="uri" href="Polybius" title="wikilink">Polybius</a> in his <em>Universal History</em> was written around seventy years after Archimedes' death, and was used subsequently as a source by Plutarch and <a class="uri" href="Livy" title="wikilink">Livy</a>. It sheds little light on Archimedes as a person, and focuses on the war machines that he is said to have built in order to defend the city.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="discoveries-and-inventions">Discoveries and inventions</h2>
<h3 id="archimedes-principle">Archimedes' principle</h3>

<p>The most widely known <a class="uri" href="anecdote" title="wikilink">anecdote</a> about Archimedes tells of how he invented a method for determining the volume of an object with an irregular shape. According to <a class="uri" href="Vitruvius" title="wikilink">Vitruvius</a>, a <a href="votive_crown" title="wikilink">votive crown</a> for a temple had been made for King Hiero II, who had supplied the pure <a class="uri" href="gold" title="wikilink">gold</a> to be used, and Archimedes was asked to determine whether some <a class="uri" href="silver" title="wikilink">silver</a> had been substituted by the dishonest goldsmith.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Archimedes had to solve the problem without damaging the crown, so he could not melt it down into a regularly shaped body in order to calculate its <a class="uri" href="density" title="wikilink">density</a>. While taking a bath, he noticed that the level of the water in the tub rose as he got in, and realized that this effect could be used to determine the <a class="uri" href="volume" title="wikilink">volume</a> of the crown. For practical purposes water is incompressible,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> so the submerged crown would displace an amount of water equal to its own volume. By dividing the mass of the crown by the volume of water displaced, the density of the crown could be obtained. This density would be lower than that of gold if cheaper and less dense metals had been added. Archimedes then took to the streets naked, so excited by his discovery that he had forgotten to dress, crying "<a href="Eureka_(word)" title="wikilink">Eureka</a>!" (,<em>heúrēka</em>!", meaning "I have found [it]!"). The test was conducted successfully, proving that silver had indeed been mixed in.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>The story of the golden crown does not appear in the known works of Archimedes. Moreover, the practicality of the method it describes has been called into question, due to the extreme accuracy with which one would have to measure the water displacement.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Archimedes may have instead sought a solution that applied the principle known in <a href="fluid_statics" title="wikilink">hydrostatics</a> as <a href="Archimedes'_principle" title="wikilink">Archimedes' principle</a>, which he describes in his treatise <em>On Floating Bodies</em>. This principle states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a <a href="buoyancy" title="wikilink">buoyant force</a> equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Using this principle, it would have been possible to compare the density of the golden crown to that of solid gold by balancing the crown on a scale with a gold reference sample, then immersing the apparatus in water. The difference in density between the two samples would cause the scale to tip accordingly. <a href="Galileo_Galilei" title="wikilink">Galileo</a> considered it "probable that this method is the same that Archimedes followed, since, besides being very accurate, it is based on demonstrations found by Archimedes himself."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In a 12th-century text titled <em>Mappae clavicula</em> there are instructions on how to perform the weighings in the water in order to calculate the percentage of silver used, and thus solve the problem.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The Latin poem <em>Carmen de ponderibus et mensuris</em> of the 4th or 5th century describes the use of a hydrostatic balance to solve the problem of the crown, and attributes the method to Archimedes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="archimedes-screw">Archimedes' screw</h3>

<p> A large part of Archimedes' work in engineering arose from fulfilling the needs of his home city of Syracuse. The Greek writer <a href="Athenaeus" title="wikilink">Athenaeus of Naucratis</a> described how King Hiero II commissioned Archimedes to design a huge ship, the <em><a class="uri" href="Syracusia" title="wikilink">Syracusia</a></em>, which could be used for luxury travel, carrying supplies, and as a naval warship. The <em>Syracusia</em> is said to have been the largest ship built in classical antiquity.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> According to Athenaeus, it was capable of carrying 600 people and included garden decorations, a <a href="Gymnasium_(ancient_Greece)" title="wikilink">gymnasium</a> and a temple dedicated to the goddess <a class="uri" href="Aphrodite" title="wikilink">Aphrodite</a> among its facilities. Since a ship of this size would leak a considerable amount of water through the hull, the <a href="Archimedes'_screw" title="wikilink">Archimedes' screw</a> was purportedly developed in order to remove the bilge water. Archimedes' machine was a device with a revolving screw-shaped blade inside a cylinder. It was turned by hand, and could also be used to transfer water from a  body of water into irrigation canals. The Archimedes' screw is still in use today for pumping liquids and granulated solids such as coal and grain. The Archimedes' screw described in Roman times by <a class="uri" href="Vitruvius" title="wikilink">Vitruvius</a> may have been an improvement on a screw pump that was used to irrigate the <a href="Hanging_Gardens_of_Babylon" title="wikilink">Hanging Gardens of Babylon</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The world's first seagoing <a href="steamboat" title="wikilink">steamship</a> with a <a href="propeller" title="wikilink">screw propeller</a> was the <em><a href="SS_Archimedes" title="wikilink">SS Archimedes</a></em>, which was launched in 1839 and named in honor of Archimedes and his work on the screw.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="claw-of-archimedes">Claw of Archimedes</h3>

<p>The <a href="Claw_of_Archimedes" title="wikilink">Claw of Archimedes</a> is a weapon that he is said to have designed in order to defend the city of Syracuse. Also known as "the ship shaker," the claw consisted of a crane-like arm from which a large metal grappling hook was suspended. When the claw was dropped onto an attacking ship the arm would swing upwards, lifting the ship out of the water and possibly sinking it. There have been modern experiments to test the feasibility of the claw, and in 2005 a television documentary entitled <em>Superweapons of the Ancient World</em> built a version of the claw and concluded that it was a workable device.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="heat-ray">Heat ray</h3>

<p> </p>

<p>Archimedes may have used mirrors acting collectively as a <a href="parabolic_reflector" title="wikilink">parabolic reflector</a> to burn ships attacking <a href="Syracuse,_Sicily" title="wikilink">Syracuse</a>. The 2nd century AD author <a class="uri" href="Lucian" title="wikilink">Lucian</a> wrote that during the <a href="Siege_of_Syracuse_(212_BC)" title="wikilink">Siege of Syracuse</a> (<em>c.</em> 214–212 BC), Archimedes destroyed enemy ships with fire. Centuries later, <a href="Anthemius_of_Tralles" title="wikilink">Anthemius of Tralles</a> mentions <a href="burning-glass" title="wikilink">burning-glasses</a> as Archimedes' weapon.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The device, sometimes called the "Archimedes heat ray", was used to focus sunlight onto approaching ships, causing them to catch fire.</p>

<p>This purported weapon has been the subject of ongoing debate about its credibility since the Renaissance. <a href="René_Descartes" title="wikilink">René Descartes</a> rejected it as false, while modern researchers have attempted to recreate the effect using only the means that would have been available to Archimedes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> It has been suggested that a large array of highly polished <a class="uri" href="bronze" title="wikilink">bronze</a> or <a class="uri" href="copper" title="wikilink">copper</a> shields acting as mirrors could have been employed to focus sunlight onto a ship. This would have used the principle of the <a href="parabolic_reflector" title="wikilink">parabolic reflector</a> in a manner similar to a <a href="solar_furnace" title="wikilink">solar furnace</a>.</p>

<p>A test of the Archimedes heat ray was carried out in 1973 by the Greek scientist Ioannis Sakkas. The experiment took place at the <a class="uri" href="Skaramagas" title="wikilink">Skaramagas</a> naval base outside <a class="uri" href="Athens" title="wikilink">Athens</a>. On this occasion 70 mirrors were used, each with a copper coating and a size of around five by three feet (1.5 by 1 m). The mirrors were pointed at a plywood  of a Roman warship at a distance of around 160 feet (50 m). When the mirrors were focused accurately, the ship burst into flames within a few seconds. The plywood ship had a coating of <a href="bitumen" title="wikilink">tar</a> paint, which may have aided combustion.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> A coating of tar would have been commonplace on ships in the classical era.</p>

<p>In October 2005 a group of students from the <a href="Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="wikilink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> carried out an experiment with 127 one-foot (30 cm) square mirror tiles, focused on a  wooden ship at a range of around 100 feet (30 m). Flames broke out on a patch of the ship, but only after the sky had been cloudless and the ship had remained stationary for around ten minutes. It was concluded that the device was a feasible weapon under these conditions. The MIT group repeated the experiment for the television show <em><a class="uri" href="MythBusters" title="wikilink">MythBusters</a></em>, using a wooden fishing boat in <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a> as the target. Again some charring occurred, along with a small amount of flame. In order to catch fire, wood needs to reach its <a href="autoignition_temperature" title="wikilink">autoignition temperature</a>, which is around 300 °C (570 °F).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>When <em>MythBusters</em> broadcast the result of the San Francisco experiment in January 2006, the claim was placed in the category of "busted" (or failed) because of the length of time and the ideal weather conditions required for combustion to occur. It was also pointed out that since Syracuse faces the sea towards the east, the Roman fleet would have had to attack during the morning for optimal gathering of light by the mirrors. <em>MythBusters</em> also pointed out that conventional weaponry, such as flaming arrows or bolts from a catapult, would have been a far easier way of setting a ship on fire at short distances.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p>In December 2010, <em>MythBusters</em> again looked at the heat ray story in a special edition entitled "President's Challenge". Several experiments were carried out, including a large scale test with 500 schoolchildren aiming mirrors at a  of a Roman sailing ship 400 feet (120 m) away. In all of the experiments, the sail failed to reach the 210 °C (410 °F) required to catch fire, and the verdict was again "busted". The show concluded that a more likely effect of the mirrors would have been blinding, <a href="Glare_(vision)" title="wikilink">dazzling</a>, or distracting the crew of the ship.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p>While Archimedes did not invent the <a class="uri" href="lever" title="wikilink">lever</a>, he gave an explanation of the principle involved in his work <em>On the Equilibrium of Planes</em>. Earlier descriptions of the lever are found in the <a href="Peripatetic_school" title="wikilink">Peripatetic school</a> of the followers of <a class="uri" href="Aristotle" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a>, and are sometimes attributed to <a class="uri" href="Archytas" title="wikilink">Archytas</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> According to <a href="Pappus_of_Alexandria" title="wikilink">Pappus of Alexandria</a>, Archimedes' work on levers caused him to remark: "Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth." ()<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Plutarch describes how Archimedes designed <a href="block_and_tackle" title="wikilink">block-and-tackle</a> <a class="uri" href="pulley" title="wikilink">pulley</a> systems, allowing sailors to use the principle of <a href="lever" title="wikilink">leverage</a> to lift objects that would otherwise have been too heavy to move.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Archimedes has also been credited with improving the power and accuracy of the <a class="uri" href="catapult" title="wikilink">catapult</a>, and with inventing the <a class="uri" href="odometer" title="wikilink">odometer</a> during the <a href="First_Punic_War" title="wikilink">First Punic War</a>. The odometer was described as a cart with a gear mechanism that dropped a ball into a container after each mile traveled.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p><a class="uri" href="Cicero" title="wikilink">Cicero</a> (106–43 BC) mentions Archimedes briefly in his <a class="uri" href="dialogue" title="wikilink">dialogue</a> <em><a href="De_re_publica" title="wikilink">De re publica</a></em>, which portrays a fictional conversation taking place in 129 BC. After the capture of Syracuse <em>c.</em> 212 BC, General <a href="Marcus_Claudius_Marcellus" title="wikilink">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</a> is said to have taken back to Rome two mechanisms, constructed by Archimedes and used as aids in astronomy, which showed the motion of the Sun, Moon and five planets. Cicero mentions similar mechanisms designed by <a href="Thales" title="wikilink">Thales of Miletus</a> and <a href="Eudoxus_of_Cnidus" title="wikilink">Eudoxus of Cnidus</a>. The dialogue says that Marcellus kept one of the devices as his only personal loot from Syracuse, and donated the other to the Temple of Virtue in Rome. Marcellus' mechanism was demonstrated, according to Cicero, by <a href="Gaius_Sulpicius_Gallus" title="wikilink">Gaius Sulpicius Gallus</a> to <a href="Lucius_Furius_Philus" title="wikilink">Lucius Furius Philus</a>, who described it thus:</p>

Modern research in this area has been focused on the <a href="Antikythera_mechanism" title="wikilink">Antikythera mechanism</a>, another device built  BC that was probably designed for the same purpose.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Constructing mechanisms of this kind would have required a sophisticated knowledge of <a href="Differential_(mechanical_device)" title="wikilink">differential gearing</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> This was once thought to have been beyond the range of the technology available in ancient times, but the discovery of the Antikythera mechanism in 1902 has confirmed that devices of this kind were known to the ancient Greeks.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p> While he is often regarded as a designer of mechanical devices, Archimedes also made contributions to the field of mathematics. <a class="uri" href="Plutarch" title="wikilink">Plutarch</a> wrote: "He placed his whole affection and ambition in those purer speculations where there can be no reference to the vulgar needs of life."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Archimedes was able to use <a href="infinitesimal" title="wikilink">infinitesimals</a> in a way that is similar to modern <a href="Integral" title="wikilink">integral calculus</a>. Through proof by contradiction (<a href="reductio_ad_absurdum" title="wikilink">reductio ad absurdum</a>), he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the <a href="method_of_exhaustion" title="wikilink">method of exhaustion</a>, and he employed it to approximate the value of π. In <em><a href="Measurement_of_a_Circle" title="wikilink">Measurement of a Circle</a></em> he did this by drawing a larger <a href="regular_hexagon" title="wikilink">regular hexagon</a> outside a <a class="uri" href="circle" title="wikilink">circle</a> and a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle, and progressively doubling the number of sides of each regular polygon, calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step. As the number of sides increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. After four such steps, when the polygons had 96 sides each, he was able to determine that the value of π lay between 3

<p>In <em><a href="The_Sand_Reckoner" title="wikilink">The Sand Reckoner</a></em>, Archimedes set out to calculate the number of grains of sand that the universe could contain. In doing so, he challenged the notion that the number of grains of sand was too large to be counted. He wrote: "There are some, King Gelo (Gelo II, son of <a href="Hiero_II_of_Syracuse" title="wikilink">Hiero II</a>), who think that the number of the sand is infinite in multitude; and I mean by the sand not only that which exists about Syracuse and the rest of Sicily but also that which is found in every region whether inhabited or uninhabited." To solve the problem, Archimedes devised a system of counting based on the <a class="uri" href="myriad" title="wikilink">myriad</a>. The word is from the Greek  <em>murias</em>, for the number 10,000. He proposed a number system using powers of a myriad of myriads (100 million) and concluded that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe would be 8 <a href="Names_of_large_numbers" title="wikilink">vigintillion</a>, or 8
