<h1>QI (G series)</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The seventh series of <em><a class="uri" href="QI" title="wikilink">QI</a></em>, the <a class="uri" href="BBC" title="wikilink">BBC</a> comedy <a href="panel_game" title="wikilink">panel game</a> <a href="television_show" title="wikilink">television show</a> hosted by <a href="Stephen_Fry" title="wikilink">Stephen Fry</a>, started on 26 November 2009. As each series of <em>QI</em> is based around a letter of the alphabet, all episodes in the series had themes beginning with the letter "g". Series G was the first in the show's history to be aired in its entirety on BBC One, beginning its run on 26 November 2009.</p>
<h2 id="episodes">Episodes</h2>

<p>Series G featured a total of 16 editions, plus an extra two compilation episodes, making it the longest series yet,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and was the first to be broadcast in its entirety on BBC One. As with the previous series, extended "XL" editions were also shown on BBC Two soon after the normal broadcast. Because of scheduling issues, this only began with the fourth episode. The first episode eventually had its "XL" edition aired some time after the original, but episodes 2, 3, 15 and 16 did not have their XL editions aired until the series was first shown on the digital channel <a href="Dave_(TV_channel)" title="wikilink">Dave</a>.</p>

<p>Nine new guests appeared in this series; <a href="Jack_Dee" title="wikilink">Jack Dee</a>, <a href="John_Hodgman" title="wikilink">John Hodgman</a>, <a href="Barry_Humphries" title="wikilink">Barry Humphries</a>, <a href="Lee_Mack" title="wikilink">Lee Mack</a>, <a href="Graham_Norton" title="wikilink">Graham Norton</a>, <a href="Sue_Perkins" title="wikilink">Sue Perkins</a>, <a href="Jan_Ravens" title="wikilink">Jan Ravens</a>, <a href="David_Tennant" title="wikilink">David Tennant</a> and <a href="Sandi_Toksvig" title="wikilink">Sandi Toksvig</a>. Another significant first is that episode 2 featured four guests instead of the usual three (with regular <a href="Alan_Davies" title="wikilink">Alan Davies</a> also present).</p>

<p>Accompanying the recordings was a little game Stephen Fry had set up for his <a class="uri" href="Twitter" title="wikilink">Twitter</a> followers posted via <a class="uri" href="AudioBoo" title="wikilink">AudioBoo</a>. The object was to decipher a word the audience had shouted.</p>

<p>In Australia, this series being currently broadcast on the <a href="Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation" title="wikilink">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a> flagship network, ABC1, on Tuesday nights, and then placed on iView, the ABC's online viewing site after the airing, expiring after 2 weeks.</p>

<li>Up until the 20th century, baby boys wore pink and baby girls wore blue. Boys at that time were also referred to as girls. In 1900, <em><a href="Dressmaker_Magazine" title="wikilink">Dressmaker Magazine</a></em> said "The preferred colour to dress young boys in is pink. Blue is reserved for girls as it is presumed paler and the more dainty of the two colours, and pink is thought to be stronger". In 1927, <a href="Astrid_of_Sweden" title="wikilink">Princess Astrid of Belgium</a> caused controversy when she gave birth to a girl, as "the cradle had been optimistically outfitted in pink, the colour for boys". It was believed that blue was more serene and paler, hence it was used for girls. Up until the mid-15th century, all children were referred to as girls. Boys were known as "knave girls" and girls were known as "gay girls". Only in recent times, has "boy" referred to a male child;before that it meant a servant.</li>
<li>At the moment, it's believed that the best way to get a baby girl is to have a <a href="Calorie_restriction" title="wikilink">low-calorie diet</a>. A study was done and out of 100 people who had had a high-calorie diet, 56 gave birth to a boy. Women who had at least one <a href="Bowl_(vessel)" title="wikilink">bowl</a> of breakfast cereal a day were 87% more likely to have a boy than women who ate no more than one bowl a week. On average, women who had boys had roughly 400 more calories daily than those who had girls. Women who were <a href="infection" title="wikilink">infected</a> with <a href="Hepatitis_B" title="wikilink">Hepatitis B</a> were 1½ times more likely to have a boy. The only known certain way is by <a href="Preimplantation_genetic_diagnosis" title="wikilink">embryo selection</a>, which is popular in America and <a class="uri" href="Thailand" title="wikilink">Thailand</a>. It costs around US$18,000. <a class="uri" href="Aristotle" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a> believed that the diet of the mother and the <a href="sex_position" title="wikilink">sex position</a> at <a href="conception_(biology)" title="wikilink">conception</a> made the difference. <a class="uri" href="Anaxagoras" title="wikilink">Anaxagoras</a> thought that boys and girls came from different <a href="testicle" title="wikilink">testicles</a>, so if you tied up one testicle, it would guarantee you the other one. The <a class="uri" href="Talmud" title="wikilink">Talmud</a> suggest lining up the bed north-south before sex, if you want a boy. The French suggest wearing boots to bed would get you a boy.</li>
<li>The reason that there are fewer female guests on <em>QI</em> is because women laugh less at other women, despite the fact that they laugh more than men, although audiences in general laugh more at men. It is believed that men make prats of themselves more often than women, although <a href="Lucille_Ball" title="wikilink">Lucille Ball</a> and <a href="Goldie_Hawn" title="wikilink">Goldie Hawn</a> are two examples of women who can do that. As <a href="stand-up_comedy" title="wikilink">stand-up comedy</a> was getting more popular during the 1980s, women portray women, but men didn't portray women, so women treated themselves as a minority, even though they are 51% of the population. <a href="Germaine_Greer" title="wikilink">Germaine Greer</a> famously said, "there are only two things that women don't do as well as men, and that's design dresses and cook" considering that nearly all the great chefs and <a href="couturier" title="wikilink">couturiers</a> are men, whereas it was the traditional role of women to cooks and sew.</li>
<li>In China, <a href="Nü_Shu" title="wikilink">Nü Shu</a> is a form of <a class="uri" href="writing" title="wikilink">writing</a> devised in <a href="Jiangyong_County" title="wikilink">Jiangyong County</a>, <a class="uri" href="Hunan" title="wikilink">Hunan</a> <a href="Province_of_China" title="wikilink">Province</a>. It was a writing form that only women could understand. Since, women in China were not taught properly at all, they needed a secret code of writing. Nü Shu is a <a href="phonetics" title="wikilink">phonetic</a> type of writing. When a woman in one of these secret friendship groups got married, they were given a book in which they would leave some blank pages, so they could write their secret thoughts down, which only women could read. They would send them, because they could never meet in their groups often, because they had <a href="foot_binding" title="wikilink">bound feet</a>. Foot binding involved breaking all the bones in the feet of 5 year olds, so they could wrap their feet round themselves and then have them wrapped up to be around 3 inches. The feet of many would rot and many died of <a class="uri" href="gangrene" title="wikilink">gangrene</a>. This went on for around 1,000 years. They would also write using <a href="tapestry" title="wikilink">tapestries</a>.</li>
<li>The panelists are shown a picture of an animal. The animal is half <a href="chicken" title="wikilink">hen</a>, half <a class="uri" href="cockerel" title="wikilink">cockerel</a>.

<li>It's impossible to tell a woman from a man just by looking at them. It was believed that the easiest way to tell them apart was by the fact that women don't have <a href="Laryngeal_prominence" title="wikilink">Adam's apples</a>, but they do. Even so, a good <a href="kathoey" title="wikilink">ladyboy</a> can imitate just about any female characteristics.</li>
<li>Men are better at map reading than women because of <a href="grey_matter" title="wikilink">grey matter</a> and <a href="white_matter" title="wikilink">white matter</a> <em>(forfeit: they're not)</em>. Using <a class="uri" href="MRI" title="wikilink">MRI</a> scans on men and women with equal <a href="intelligence_quotient" title="wikilink">IQ</a>, they found that men use 6½ times more grey matter than women, whereas women used 9 times more white matter than men. Grey matter is central to processing information for intellectual thought, such as map reading and mathematics. White matter connects the processing information to emotional thought such as language speaking and multitasking.</li>
<li>The <a href="prize_money" title="wikilink">prize money</a> given out at Wimbledon is unfair to male competitors <em>(forfeit: nothing (is unfair about it))</em>. When it began in 1884, the ladies' winner got a 20 <a href="guinea_(British_coin)" title="wikilink">guinea</a> silver flower basket and the men's champion got a 30 guinea gold trophy. In 2006, <a href="Amélie_Mauresmo" title="wikilink">Amélie Mauresmo</a> won <a href="Pound_sterling" title="wikilink">£</a>625,000 for playing 142 games, whereas <a href="Roger_Federer" title="wikilink">Roger Federer</a> got £655,000 for playing 202 games. The women therefore got more money, because the short matches allowed them to play in doubles tournaments as well. The rate per game in 2005 was £1,432 per game for the top 8 women, whereas the top 8 men got £993 per game. The prize money is equal in terms of money, but not equal as the men have to play more tennis.</li>

<li>The word for people who don't laugh is <a href="wikt:agelastic" title="wikilink">agelastic</a>. Examples given were <a href="Isaac_Newton" title="wikilink">Isaac Newton</a>, who only laughed once in his whole life, <a href="Joseph_Stalin" title="wikilink">Joseph Stalin</a>, who never laughed according to <a href="Georgy_Zhukov" title="wikilink">Marshal Zhukov</a>, <a href="Jonathan_Swift" title="wikilink">Jonathan Swift</a> and <a href="William_Ewart_Gladstone" title="wikilink">William Ewart Gladstone</a>. Whereas <a href="Anthony_Trollope" title="wikilink">Anthony Trollope</a> couldn't stop laughing, he actually died giggling. There are <a href="Theories_of_humor" title="wikilink">theories of laughter</a>: the superiority theory, the sudden glory felt when someone else suffers; the incongruity theory, when the logical dissolves into the absurd, and the relief theory, which was <a href="Sigmund_Freud" title="wikilink">Freud's idea</a>, relieving inhibition to forbidden thoughts and feelings, which leads to Jimmy talking about his book, <em>The Naked Jape</em>, which was about theories like that from around the world. Animals can't laugh.</li>
<li>The oldest joke in the world was "There was an absent-minded professor who was on a sea voyage when a storm blows up and his <a href="slave" title="wikilink">slaves</a> are weeping in terror. He said, "Don't cry, I have freed you all in my <a href="will_(law)" title="wikilink">will</a>"". That joke depicted the Abderites as being rather stupid. The Greek joke book, the <a class="uri" href="Philogelos" title="wikilink">Philogelos</a> has this joke inside it: "An Abderite asks a <a class="uri" href="eunuch" title="wikilink">eunuch</a> how many children he has, the eunuch replies "None, Duh! I'm a eunuch!", then the Abderite says..." The <a href="punch_line" title="wikilink">punch line</a> of that joke is actually missing. Another old joke is a <a href="Sumer" title="wikilink">Sumerian</a> one from 1900BC, which goes "something that has never occurred since time immemorial – a young woman did not <a href="farting" title="wikilink">fart</a> in her husband's lap."

<li>"What do you get if you cross a <a class="uri" href="caterpillar" title="wikilink">caterpillar</a> and a <a class="uri" href="butterfly" title="wikilink">butterfly</a>?" <em>(Forfeits: butterpillar, caterfly)</em> There is a theory put forward by <a href="Donald_I._Williamson" title="wikilink">Donald Williamson</a> called <a href="Parthenogenesis#Hybridogenesis" title="wikilink">hybridogenesis</a> stating the butterfly and the caterpillar are of different <a class="uri" href="species" title="wikilink">species</a>. Normal <a class="uri" href="starfish" title="wikilink">starfish</a> start life as a small <a class="uri" href="larva" title="wikilink">larva</a> with a tiny starfish inside. They grow and separate and the larva <a href="degeneration" title="wikilink">degenerates</a>. Williamson found the <a href="Luidia_sarsi" title="wikilink">Luidia sarsi</a> differs with the larva living for months as an independent animal. He reasons there is a chance of creating a double species, since "<a class="uri" href="sperm" title="wikilink">sperm</a> and seed" have been mixing in the sea for millions of years, so these new species could be created once every million years.</li>
<li>1% of American adults are in jail, roughly 2.3 million, or 1 in every 99.1 adults. More than twice as many as South Africans, more than three times as the Iranians, more than six times as the Chinese. No society in history has imprisoned more of its citizens than the United States. The United Kingdom is ahead of China, Turkey and India, with 148 prisoners per 100,000. In the USA, they have the <a href="three_strikes_law" title="wikilink">three strikes law</a>, which gives a <a href="Life_imprisonment" title="wikilink">life sentence</a> for anyone's third crime, no matter how trivial, providing they have 2 serious crimes against them already.

<li><a href="Luigi_Galvani" title="wikilink">Luigi Galvani</a> from <a class="uri" href="Bologna" title="wikilink">Bologna</a> discovered that electricity works through frogs, hence creating the term <a class="uri" href="galvanization" title="wikilink">galvanization</a>, which meant that humans worked with electricity.

<li>Theoretically, you can get to anywhere on Earth in exactly 42 minutes and 12 seconds, by burrowing through it. The speed would be the maximum velocity as determined by gravity</li>
<li>Aristotle believed that heavier objects fell faster than lighter objects, but this theory was disproved by Galileo Galilei who did experiments using ramps (Forfeit: dropping cannonballs from the Leaning Tower of Pisa)</li>
<li>George Biggin and Letitia Sage flew in a hydrogen balloon from <a class="uri" href="Southwark" title="wikilink">Southwark</a> to <a href="London_Borough_of_Harrow" title="wikilink">Harrow</a>, during which time they became the first members of the <a href="mile_high_club" title="wikilink">mile high club</a>. Vincenzo Lunardi, an Italian who brought ballooning to Britain, was going to go up with Biggin &amp; Sage, but he thought the basket would be too heavy.</li>
<li>A <a class="uri" href="gossypiboma" title="wikilink">gossypiboma</a> is something left inside you by a surgeon after he has done an operation—normally cotton, lint or sponge. (Forfeit: mind your own business)</li>
<li>When you shoot a gun in the air, the bullets land in a different place, so the shooter would never be hit, as even a small blast of wind would move it away from the gun. A test was done on a floating platform, where 500 <a href="bullet" title="wikilink">bullets</a> were shot in the air and only 4 landed on the platform. A typical 7.62mm bullet fired vertically can reach a height of nearly 2.5<a href="kilometre" title="wikilink">km</a>, meaning it would take 17 seconds to reach top height, then take another 40 seconds to come down, if it were going at a speed of 70 metres a second, which would cause serious cranial injuries. If you had a bullet in one hand and a gun facing horizontally at the same level in another, both bullets would hit the ground at the same time, if fired at the same time. The reason is that they both have the same force working on them: gravity. The only way this couldn't happen is if the bullet were fired at 5 miles per second, which means it would leave the Earth and never return into the atmosphere, or if the bullet went far enough, because then the <a class="uri" href="curvature" title="wikilink">curvature</a> of the Earth would mean it had further to fall. There are many practical applications to this in the <a href="physical_law" title="wikilink">laws of physics</a> which say it must be the case.</li>

When you want to turn left on a bicycle, you turn the <a href="Bicycle_handlebar" title="wikilink">handlebar</a> slightly to the right, known as <a class="uri" href="countersteering" title="wikilink">countersteering</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="Fosbury_Flop" title="wikilink">Fosbury Flop</a> was created by <a href="Dick_Fosbury" title="wikilink">Dick Fosbury</a> as a better <a href="Skill" title="wikilink">technique</a> for completing a <a href="high_jump" title="wikilink">high jump</a>. The previous techniques were the <a href="straddle_technique" title="wikilink">straddle</a>, the Western roll, the <a href="Scissors-Jump" title="wikilink">Scissors</a> and the <a href="Eastern_cut-off" title="wikilink">Eastern cut-off</a>. In the <a href="1968_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1968 Summer Olympics</a>, he performed this new technique and won the gold medal. The reason why every high jumper now uses the Fosbury Flop is because of the way the <a href="center_of_mass" title="wikilink">centre of gravity</a> works. When doing the Flop, your centre of gravity is under the bar, whereas if you did the Scissors, your centre of gravity would be 30<a href="centimetre" title="wikilink">cm</a> over the bar. So, by having a lower centre of gravity, you have more height in exchange for no extra effort. The other thing the Flop did was change the landing material from a <a class="uri" href="sandpit" title="wikilink">sandpit</a> to a <a class="uri" href="cushion" title="wikilink">cushion</a>. The records have stood for a long time. The male record was set in 1993, while the female one was set in 1987.

The difference between a grotesque and a gargoyle is that gargoyles are used for <a class="uri" href="draining" title="wikilink">draining</a> and guttering in <a href="Gothic_architecture" title="wikilink">Gothic buildings</a>.

Goth has tended to mean other things though, such as the <a href="cathedral" title="wikilink">cathedrals</a>, which were called "barbaric" during the <a href="Italian_Renaissance" title="wikilink">Italian Renaissance</a>, as it was used as an insult for anything that wasn't classic, because they were perceived to be the people who destroyed Rome and therefore <a class="uri" href="civilisation" title="wikilink">civilisation</a>. <a href="Gothic_fiction" title="wikilink">Gothic literature</a> has tended to be referred to as "<a class="uri" href="macabre" title="wikilink">macabre</a>". <a href="Carpenter_Gothic" title="wikilink">Carpenter Gothic</a> is a form of craftsmanship famously depicted in the <a href="Grant_Wood" title="wikilink">Grant Wood</a> <a class="uri" href="painting" title="wikilink">painting</a> <em><a href="American_Gothic" title="wikilink">American Gothic</a></em>, which showed a house, now known as the <a href="American_Gothic_House" title="wikilink">American Gothic House</a> in the town of <a href="Eldon,_Iowa" title="wikilink">Eldon, Iowa</a>.

It was first discovered by <a href="Wade_Davis" title="wikilink">Wade Davis</a>, an <a href="ethnobotany" title="wikilink">ethnobotanist</a> in the 1980s, but his theory that it put people into a sort of "zombie <a class="uri" href="trance" title="wikilink">trance</a>" isn't universally accepted.</li>

<li>The best way to make sure your family never forget you after you die is to make a lifesize <a class="uri" href="replica" title="wikilink">replica</a> of yourself. The Japanese artist <a href="Hananuma_Masakichi" title="wikilink">Hananuma Masakichi</a> was diagnosed with <a class="uri" href="tuberculosis" title="wikilink">tuberculosis</a> in the 1880s, so he knew he was going to die, so he made a life-size replica of himself that matched him exactly, with every hair from every <a href="Sweat_pore" title="wikilink">pore</a> on his body included, as well as his <a href="fingernail" title="wikilink">fingernails</a>, <a href="toenail" title="wikilink">toenails</a>, <a href="tooth" title="wikilink">teeth</a> and having glass eyes made in place of real ones. It was so lifelike, that people couldn't tell which was the real one and which was the fake. It eventually went into <a href="Robert_Ripley" title="wikilink">Robert Ripley</a>'s Odditorium in Los Angeles, but it got injured in an <a class="uri" href="earthquake" title="wikilink">earthquake</a> in 1996, and is awaiting <a href="Antiques_restoration" title="wikilink">restoration</a>.</li>
<li>In the 1960s, ⅔ of all <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">Americans</a> who accidentally lost a <a href="limb_(anatomy)" title="wikilink">limb</a> came from the same town in Florida. The reason was <a class="uri" href="insurance" title="wikilink">insurance</a>. There were 50 occurrences in the town which had a population of just 500.

<li>After the <a href="Vietnam_War" title="wikilink">Vietnam War</a>, the <a href="Tomb_of_the_Unknowns#The_Unknown_of_Vietnam" title="wikilink">Tomb of the Unknown Soldier</a> was occupied by a <a class="uri" href="soldier" title="wikilink">soldier</a> who had died in <a class="uri" href="Vietnam" title="wikilink">Vietnam</a> <em>(forfeit: nobody knows)</em>. His family had heard that "the Unknown Soldier" had died in a <a class="uri" href="helicopter" title="wikilink">helicopter</a> crash, and their son had also died in the same helicopter crash, but through <a href="Mitochondrial_DNA" title="wikilink">DNA testing</a>, it was proved that he was "the Unknown Soldier", so his remains were <a href="Burial#Exhumation" title="wikilink">exhumed</a>. It's believed that there never will be another "Unknown Soldier", because all British &amp; American soldiers are DNA profiled. The original "Unknown Soldier" was first done simultaneously in Britain &amp; France after World War I in 1920. In Britain, there were 4 bodies and the general pointed at one and he became "the Unknown Soldier". That particular soldier was given a <a href="state_funeral" title="wikilink">state funeral</a> at <a href="Westminster_Abbey" title="wikilink">Westminster Abbey</a> with full military honours and was entombed with a <a class="uri" href="Medieval" title="wikilink">Medieval</a> <a href="Crusades" title="wikilink">crusader</a>'s <a class="uri" href="sword" title="wikilink">sword</a> from the <a href="Royal_Collection" title="wikilink">Royal Collection</a> in the presence of a guard made up of 100 VC's.

<li>In a graveyard, burying a person under a broken <a class="uri" href="column" title="wikilink">column</a> means that they died young.

<li>The <a href="Vampire_Squid" title="wikilink">Vampire Squid</a> from <a class="uri" href="Hell" title="wikilink">Hell</a>, Latin name <em>Vampyroteuthis infernalis</em>, has the biggest eyes of any animal in comparison to the size of its head, if it were put into a human, the eyes of a human would be a <a href="foot_(length)" title="wikilink">foot</a> wide.

<li>The toughest way to become a <a class="uri" href="mummy" title="wikilink">mummy</a> is by self-mummification.

A <a href="Buddhism" title="wikilink">Buddhist</a> sect called <a class="uri" href="Sokushinbutsu" title="wikilink">Sokushinbutsu</a> use self-mummification. To do this, for 1,000 days, a priest would eat nuts and seeds, while taking part in vigorous physical activity, so he'd have no <a href="adipose_tissue" title="wikilink">body fat</a>. Then for another 1,000 days, he's eat just bark and tree roots and then drink a poisonous tea made from the sap of the <a href="Toxicodendron_vernicifluum" title="wikilink">Urushi tree</a>, which would cause him to vomit and lose bodily fluids. Then he'd be locked inside a small stone tomb with just an air tube and a bell while doing the <a href="lotus_position" title="wikilink">lotus position</a>. He'd ring the bell every day to prove he was alive. When the bell stopped ringing, the tube was removed and the tomb was sealed. Then after another 1,000 days, the tomb was checked and if it was successful, he was deemed to have reached <a href="enlightenment_(spiritual)" title="wikilink">enlightenment</a>.

<li>The word <a href="gymnasium_(ancient_Greece)" title="wikilink">gymnasium</a> comes from the Greek word "Gymnos", meaning <a href="nudity" title="wikilink">naked</a>, hence "gymnasium" meant "a naked place".

<li>If you bite a gold coin and a toothmark is left, then it's a fake coin, because other metals were used in making gold coins but for counterfeits <a class="uri" href="lead" title="wikilink">lead</a> was used, and that did leave an impression.</li>

It was discovered after research by Dr. Peter Thompson of the <a href="University_of_York" title="wikilink">University of York</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="column" title="wikilink">columns</a> around the <a class="uri" href="Parthenon" title="wikilink">Parthenon</a> look straight because they are actually straight. It was originally believed to be an <a href="optical_illusion" title="wikilink">optical illusion</a> due to a thing called <a class="uri" href="entasis" title="wikilink">entasis</a>, which is where if a column is exactly straight, it looks big from a distance, but it looks spindly if it bows inwards. So, if you make it bow outwards, it looks straight. But, that's what they didn't do. It is also believed that entasis is used on some buildings nowadays to give them more support, but it certainly doesn't exist in the Parthenon.</li>
<li>The panellists are shown 2 shapes; a splodgy shape and a spiky shape. One is called <a href="Bouba/kiki_effect" title="wikilink">"kiki" and the other is called "bouba"</a>. Neither of the shapes are associated with the names, but the <a class="uri" href="psychologist" title="wikilink">psychologist</a> <a href="Wolfgang_Köhler" title="wikilink">Wolfgang Köhler</a> devised this test to see what people who spoke different languages thought when they heard the words "kiki" and "bouba", and everyone said that "kiki" sounded like the spiky one and "bouba" sounded like the splodgy one, a sort of <a class="uri" href="onomatopoeia" title="wikilink">onomatopoeia</a>, as it were.</li>
<li>The most successful <a class="uri" href="textbook" title="wikilink">textbook</a> of all time is <a href="Euclid's_Elements" title="wikilink">Euclid's Elements</a>. <a class="uri" href="Euclid" title="wikilink">Euclid</a>'s teachings in the book are mostly about <a href="plane_(geometry)" title="wikilink">planes</a> and <a href="conic_section" title="wikilink">conic sections</a> and all the forms of <a href="circle" title="wikilink">circles</a> and <a href="Square_(geometry)" title="wikilink">squares</a>, which basically showed how <a class="uri" href="geometry" title="wikilink">geometry</a> works, which came in very handy for <a class="uri" href="physics" title="wikilink">physics</a> and <a class="uri" href="engineering" title="wikilink">engineering</a>. Many <a href="mathematician" title="wikilink">mathematicians</a> believe it to be the most beautiful of all <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a> textbooks. <a href="John_Dee" title="wikilink">John Dee</a>, the court <a href="Illusionist" title="wikilink">magician</a> to <a href="Elizabeth_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Queen Elizabeth I</a>, was responsible for bringing Euclid to the attention of the world. He was also a <a href="espionage" title="wikilink">spy</a> and used <a href="James_Bond" title="wikilink">007</a> as a <a class="uri" href="cipher" title="wikilink">cipher</a>. Alan got 7 points for knowing that piece of information.</li>
<li>The best place to go to look into the future is on the <a href="International_Date_Line" title="wikilink">International Date Line</a>. If you're to the left of the line, you're ahead in time compared to when you're on the right of the line. Stephen lost a day when he flew from Los Angeles to Sydney recently. David then claims that if you did that every day, you'd theoretically live twice as long as everyone else, because the trip lasted one day, but in terms of actual time, it took 2 days. The literal best place to go is the <a href="Diomede_Islands" title="wikilink">Diomede Islands</a> in the <a href="Bering_Strait" title="wikilink">Bering Strait</a>. <a href="Big_Diomede" title="wikilink">Big Diomede</a> Island is on the left of the line and <a href="Little_Diomede_Island" title="wikilink">Little Diomede Island</a> is to the right of the line, so if you look at Big Diomede from Little Diomede, you are looking into the future.</li>

<li>The panellists are shown this puzzle and are asked where the missing square is. The answer is that the missing piece was created because the <a class="uri" href="hypotenuse" title="wikilink">hypotenuse</a> of the triangles are curved, not straight. The small triangle has a <a class="uri" href="ratio" title="wikilink">ratio</a> of 5:2 and the big triangle has a ratio of 8:3, so neither triangle is similar. One has a slightly dipped line, the other has a slightly "up" line. The eye assumes they're straight, but they aren't. It's known as <a href="Missing_square_puzzle" title="wikilink">Curry's paradox</a>.</li>

<li>The best place to punch a <a class="uri" href="shark" title="wikilink">shark</a> is in the eye or the <a class="uri" href="gill" title="wikilink">gill</a>, not the nose, as many people think, although it is true of dogs though. More people in the world are bitten by <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New Yorkers</a> than by sharks. 81% of people who are bitten by sharks suffered minor injuries, although people bitten by humans could get <a class="uri" href="rabies" title="wikilink">rabies</a> or other diseases. As mentioned in <a href="QI_(A_series)" title="wikilink"><em>QI</em>'s A series</a>, more people are <a href="Toilet-related_injuries_and_deaths" title="wikilink">killed by toilets</a> than by sharks every year. 120 million sharks are killed by humans every year, mainly just for their <a href="shark_finning" title="wikilink">fins</a>, so <a href="shark_fin_soup" title="wikilink">shark fin soup</a> can be produced, which according to Stephen is very tasteless, and <a href="stock_(food)" title="wikilink">chicken stock</a> is used to give it <a href="flavor" title="wikilink">flavour</a>.</li>
<li>An <a class="uri" href="octopus" title="wikilink">octopus</a> has 2 legs, or to be more specific, they use 2 arms while moving underwater, as sort of <a class="uri" href="ambulatory" title="wikilink">ambulatory</a> <a class="uri" href="gait" title="wikilink">gait</a>, and the other 4 are used for holding food, so it could be said that they have 6 arms and 2 legs.</li>
<li>Because of <a class="uri" href="libration" title="wikilink">libration</a>, you can see 59% of the Moon from the Earth. Libration is the sort of <em>jiggling effect</em> you get when you see the Moon. Obviously, when there are different <a href="Lunar_phase" title="wikilink">phases of the Moon</a>, you see less.</li>
