<h1>History of Scania</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The history of the province of <strong><a class="uri" href="Scania" title="wikilink">Scania</a></strong> was for many hundred years, up until the 18th century, marked by the struggle between the two <a href="Scandinavia" title="wikilink">Scandinavian</a> <a href="monarchy" title="wikilink">kingdoms</a> of <a class="uri" href="Denmark" title="wikilink">Denmark</a> and <a class="uri" href="Sweden" title="wikilink">Sweden</a> over the <a href="Dominium_maris_baltici" title="wikilink">hegenomy in the Baltic area</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="viking-age">Viking age</h2>

<p> It was previously thought that society in Scania, like in the rest of Scandinavia, was made up of farmers and <a href="thrall" title="wikilink">thralls</a>, the former being free and equal, and having their say at the <a href="Thing_(assembly)" title="wikilink">Things</a> in the affairs of society. Archeological findings on <a class="uri" href="Jutland" title="wikilink">Jutland</a>, the Danish islands, and on the Scanian plains have modified this picture. It has now become clear that the distribution of wealth, at least from the early <a href="Migration_Period" title="wikilink">Migration Period</a>, was very uneven. The plains were to a large extent divided up between large farms which were far bigger than <a href="smallholding" title="wikilink">smallholdings</a>, and were often grouped in villages. Subsequently, only a small faction of the population can be presumed to have enjoyed full civic rights. It seems now more likely that this society ought to be perceived as a system of <a href="tribe" title="wikilink">tribes</a>, each led by magnates or chieftains, in <a href="Danish_language" title="wikilink">Danish</a> often called <em>godes</em>, whose authority depended on the size and wealth of the tribe. These tribes would have had their own leader, and their own group of warriors, all under the command of the magnates, as was the case long after the Viking Age.</p>
<h2 id="after-the-christianization">After the Christianization</h2>

<p>It now seems likely that a period of domestic colonization within Scania that was earlier believed to have started before the Viking Age, in reality largely took place after the Viking Age, when donations of land to <a href="Monastery" title="wikilink">monasteries</a> led to influences from Continental Europe. This led to a transition from a predominantly animal husbandry-based society to one of farming, which entailed extensive land clearing, possibly also connected with the liberation of the thralls, that led to the creation of many new settlements with names ending in <em>-torp, -rup,</em> and <em>-rød.</em></p>

<p> Scania was first mentioned in written texts in the 8th century, stating that it was a part of Denmark. According to the <a href="Jelling_stones" title="wikilink">Large Jelling Stone</a>, Scanians, like all Danes were Christianized by <em>the King of all Danes</em>, <a href="Harald_Bluetooth" title="wikilink">Harald Bluetooth</a> before this stone was risen, presumably around 985 AD.</p>

<p>The <a href="Scanian_Law" title="wikilink">Scanian law</a>, the oldest of the <a href="Medieval_Scandinavian_laws" title="wikilink">Medieval Scandinavian laws</a>, came into force in the beginning of the 13th century.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It's remarkable in the sense that it's exists written in both <em>Latin letters</em> (not in <a class="uri" href="Latin" title="wikilink">Latin</a> though) as well as <a href="runic" title="wikilink">runics</a> , <em>Codex runicus</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Already in 1060 was <a href="Dalby,_Lund" title="wikilink">Dalby</a> Church build by <a href="Svend_Estridsen" title="wikilink">Svend Estridsen</a>, as one of the first Danish churches made of stone. Between 1104 and 1536, <a class="uri" href="Lund" title="wikilink">Lund</a> was the Archbishopric of Denmark, and the Danish National Banner, <a href="Flag_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Dannebrog</a>, was preserved in the <a href="Lund_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Cathedral</a> for several centuries.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> </p>

<p>In 1332 the king of Denmark, <a href="Christopher_II_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Christopher II</a>, died as a "king without a country" after he and his older brother and predecessor had divided Denmark into much smaller polities. King <a href="Magnus_IV_of_Sweden" title="wikilink">Magnus</a> took advantage of his neighbour's distress, redeeming these lands for the eastern Danish provinces for a huge amount of silver, which included Scania. The province was later reconquered by the great Danish king <a href="Valdemar_IV_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Valdemar IV of Denmark</a> in 1360, as part of his conquest campaign to regain previously lost Danish territory. During parts of the Middle Ages, Scania was known throughout Northern Europe for its <a class="uri" href="herring" title="wikilink">herring</a> and the <a href="Scania_Market" title="wikilink">market</a> were it was sold.</p>

<p>In the middle of the 14th century a deadly disease, known as the <a href="Black_Death" title="wikilink">Black Death</a> affected the area as much as in most of Europe.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Generally the population declined with a third or more.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> By the end of this century, the <a href="Kalmar_Union" title="wikilink">Kalmar Union</a> rose as an attempt to counter the <a href="Hanseatic_League" title="wikilink">Hanseatic League</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The Union was largely a creation of Queen <a href="Margaret_I_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Margaret</a> who had become Queen in Denmark and Norway in 1387, as her only son, King <a href="Olaf_II_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Olaf II of Denmark and IV of Norway</a> died.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> And two years later she helped the Swedes to get rid of the disliked <a href="Albert,_King_of_Sweden" title="wikilink">Albert av Mecklenburg</a>.

<p>Scania's <a href="geopolitics" title="wikilink">geopolitical</a> position, situated on the Scandinavian <a class="uri" href="mainland" title="wikilink">mainland</a> but politically part of the Danish <a href="monarchy" title="wikilink">kingdom</a>, made it for centuries the <a href="wiktionary:Focal_point" title="wikilink">focal point</a> of the struggle for <a class="uri" href="hegemony" title="wikilink">hegemony</a> in the <a href="Baltic_region" title="wikilink">Baltic region</a> between Denmark and Sweden, the so-called <em><a href="dominium_maris_baltici" title="wikilink">dominium maris baltici</a></em>. The two <a href="Nordic_countries" title="wikilink">Nordic countries</a> were in conflict with each other for about five hundred years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> By possessing both sides of the <a href="Oresund" title="wikilink">Øresund Strait</a>, as well as <a href="The_Belts" title="wikilink">The Belts</a>, Denmark had effective control over the entrance to the <a href="Baltic_Sea" title="wikilink">Baltic Sea</a> and was able to monopolize <a class="uri" href="trade" title="wikilink">trade</a> through the sounds. From the 15th century, Denmark started to collect the <a href="Sound_Dues" title="wikilink">Sound Dues</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> a transitory due from all foreign ships passing through the strait, whether <em>en route</em> to or from Denmark or not. The Sound Dues constituted the major source of income for the Danish crown, up until the 19th century<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and was resented by the Swedish Crown.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>In the winter of 1612, during a period of two weeks, the Swedish King <a href="Gustav_II_Adolf" title="wikilink">Gustav II Adolf</a> burned down or otherwise destroyed 24 Scanian parishes and most of their population without meeting any enemy troops. The largest destroyed settlement was the Town <a href="Vä" title="wikilink">Væ</a>, which two years later was replaced by Danish King <a href="Christian_IV_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Christian IV</a> as the nearby <a href="Kristianstad" title="wikilink">Christiansted</a> (after the Swedification process, spelled Kristianstad), the last Scanian town to be founded by a Danish king.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>During the <a href="Kalmar_War" title="wikilink">Kalmar War</a> the Danish burned Swedish settlements as well.</p>
<h2 id="section">1658–1680</h2>

<p>Following the <a href="Treaty_of_Roskilde" title="wikilink">Treaty of Roskilde</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> in 1658, Scania together with all Danish lands east of Oresund became a possession of the Swedish <a href="The_Crown" title="wikilink">Crown</a>. This treaty followed a <a href="Dano-Swedish_War_(1657-1658)" title="wikilink">war</a> started by <a href="Frederick_III_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Frederick III of Denmark</a>, with the aim to recover territories lost in 1645, but with quite another result.</p>

<p>Soon after the signing of the <a href="Legal_instrument" title="wikilink">Instrument</a> of <a class="uri" href="Cession" title="wikilink">Cession</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> king <a href="Charles_X_Gustav_of_Sweden" title="wikilink">Charles X Gustav of Sweden</a> landed in <a class="uri" href="Helsingborg" title="wikilink">Helsingborg</a> on the 5th of March 1658 (<a href="Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates" title="wikilink">O.S.</a>) to take possession of the newly acquired provinces.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The king was received by a delegation led by the <a class="uri" href="bishop" title="wikilink">bishop</a> of the <a href="Diocese_of_Lund" title="wikilink">Diocese of Lund</a>, <a href="Peder_Winstrup" title="wikilink">Peder Winstrup</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The <a class="uri" href="Copenhagen" title="wikilink">Copenhagen</a>-born bishop quickly shifted his <a class="uri" href="allegiance" title="wikilink">allegiance</a> to the new ruler and later became <a href="Swedish_nobility" title="wikilink">ennobled</a>. He stayed in office until his death in 1679.</p>

<p>After the Roskilde treaty war with Denmark soon broke out again, this time started by <a href="Charles_X_Gustav_of_Sweden" title="wikilink">Charles X Gustav of Sweden</a>. This resulted in a Swedish defeat, and as a result of the <a href="Treaty_of_Copenhagen_(1660)" title="wikilink">Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)</a> <a class="uri" href="Bornholm" title="wikilink">Bornholm</a> was returned to Denmark and the present border between the countries was established. At that time Charles Gustav was already dead.</p>

<p>Scania, together with the other so-called <a href="Skåneland" title="wikilink">Scanian provinces</a>, was placed under a <a href="Swedish_Governors-General" title="wikilink">Governor-General</a> taking up residence in the city of Malmö. The first Governor-General was <a href="Gustaf_Otto_Stenbock" title="wikilink">Gustaf Otto Stenbock</a>. This type of government was used in territories which were not fully integrated and were regarded as being more exposed to enemy attacks.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The Governor-General held the highest military command in his area and had four county governors answering to him. In 1669 the general governorate was dismantled, but after the outbreak of the <a href="Scanian_War" title="wikilink">Scanian War</a> in 1676 it was reinstituted.</p>

<p>In 1666 the <a href="University_of_Lund" title="wikilink">University of Lund</a> or <em>Regia Academia Carolina</em>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> after a proposal from <a class="uri" href="Bishop" title="wikilink">Bishop</a> <a href="Peder_Winstrup" title="wikilink">Peder Winstrup</a>, was established as part of a programme of measures to further integrate the newly acquired provinces. However, there had long been plans to establish a university in <a class="uri" href="Götaland" title="wikilink">Götaland</a> and with the new borders Lund and Scania were chosen. The university was closed during the Scanian War, but reopened in 1682.</p>

<p>The 1676–1679 war between Denmark and Sweden over Scania was devastating for the people of Skåne. It effectively ended in a draw, after much destruction of property and suffering for the civilian population. Scania, with the exception of Malmö and its fortress <a class="uri" href="Malmöhus" title="wikilink">Malmöhus</a>, returned to Danish administration. <a href="Landskrona_Citadel" title="wikilink">Landskrona Citadel</a> became used as the primary Danish base and recruitment centre<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Turning points came with the Swedish victories in the <a href="Battle_of_Lund" title="wikilink">Battle of Lund</a> in December 1676 and the <a href="Battle_of_Landskrona" title="wikilink">Battle of Landskrona</a> in July 1677. But the war continued another two years.</p>

<p>In the <a href="Treaty_of_Fontainebleau_(1679)" title="wikilink">Treaty of Fontainebleau (1679)</a> on 2.September (<a href="Gregorian_calendar" title="wikilink">Gregorian calendar</a>) peace was restored through French intervention. For a tiny sum should the <a href="Treaty_of_Copenhagen_(1660)" title="wikilink">Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)</a> borders be restored, and yet again would Scania become subordinated to the Swedish King against the will of its people.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> and the treaty was confirmed as <a href="Treaty_of_Lund" title="wikilink">Treaty of Lund</a> exactly a fortnight later, on the 16th.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="section-1">1680–1690</h2>

<p> Section 9 of the Roskilde peace treaty had initially ensured autonomy in Scania and in an additional agreement, signed at the <a href="Malmö_Recess" title="wikilink">Malmö Recess</a> in 1662, Sweden guaranteed that the old laws and privileges of Scania would continue to apply in the region. The Malmö Recess agreement further ensured that Scanian noblemen, priests and peasants would be allowed to send representatives to the <a href="Riksdag_of_the_Estates" title="wikilink">Swedish parliament</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p>However, in 1680 Sweden’s first era of <a href="absolute_monarchy" title="wikilink">absolute monarchy</a> was ushered in as the Swedish king <a href="Charles_XI" title="wikilink">Charles XI</a> managed to convince the <a href="Diet_(assembly)" title="wikilink">Diet</a>, (the <a href="Riksdag_of_the_Estates" title="wikilink">Riksdag of the Estates</a>, an early form of <a href="Swedish_Parliament" title="wikilink">Swedish Parliament</a>) to declare the king "a Christian ruler with absolute power to rule his kingdom at his discretion".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In 1682, the Diet downgraded the Council of State to a <a href="King's_Council" title="wikilink">King's Council</a> and gave the king unlimited powers to legislate without the need for confirmation from the Diet.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> A decision not to honour the agreement of the Malmö Recess soon followed and a tougher Swedification program was implemented in Scania, aiming to create uniformity within the Swedish kingdom.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Scania was allowed to retain its old laws and customs until 1683, at which point the Swedish administration persuaded the Scanian aristocracy to waive the Scanian laws and privileges in favour of the new Swedish law and <a href="Church_Order_(Lutheran)" title="wikilink">church ordinance</a>, as a condition for allowing Scanians to have representation in the Swedish parliament.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p>An entire staff of Swedish politicians, artists, poets and scholars were engaged in creating an image of the king as an instrument of God and a personification of the apocalyptic "Lion of the North", a form of symbolic imagery first introduced for <a href="Gustav_II_Adolf" title="wikilink">Gustav II Adolf</a>. The propaganda was not only aimed at convincing the Swedish population of the king's divinely ordained power, but was also part of a campaign to present Sweden to the world as an imperial power of considerable wealth and military glory.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Many works of art from the era show Charles XI as a victorious warrior in Scania and on the central panel of <a href="Jacques_Foucquet" title="wikilink">Jacques Foucquet</a>’s monumental ceiling painting in the Stockholm Royal Palace, Charles XI is depicted with "the goddess of Scania" at his feet.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="section-2">1690-1720</h2>

<p> <a class="uri" href="Blekinge" title="wikilink">Blekinge</a> and especially <a class="uri" href="Halland" title="wikilink">Halland</a> were successively removed from the Skåneland dominion and became <a href="Sweden_proper" title="wikilink">fully integrated into the Swedish Kingdom</a>, while the four counties of Scania were joined into one county. Blekinge was though allowed to remain within the diocese of Lund and still is. By 1693, Scania became a <a href="Dominions_of_Sweden" title="wikilink">left a dominion</a>, with a special, not fully integrated, status. It retained its autonomy with a parliament known as the <em>Lantdag</em>.</p>

<p>The latest battle between Denmark and Sweden concerning the control of Scania was the <a href="Battle_of_Helsingborg_(1710)" title="wikilink">Battle of Helsingborg (1710)</a> during the <a href="Great_Northern_War" title="wikilink">Great Northern War</a>. In March that year the last Danish troops left the province.</p>

<p>Scania, eventually became an official part of Sweden after a treaty in Stockholm of 3. July 1720,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> although Scania had been divided into two counties, <a href="Malmöhus_County" title="wikilink">Malmöhus County</a> (labeled after the Castle <a href="Malmöhus_Castle" title="wikilink">Malmöhus</a>) and <a href="Kristianstad_County" title="wikilink">Kristianstad County</a> already in the year before.</p>

<p>Two countys got governors and an administrative pattern identical to the other Swedish counties. However, the hostilities between Denmark and Sweden during the <a href="Napoleonic_Wars" title="wikilink">Napoleonic Wars</a> caused Sweden to reintroduce the office of the Governor-General. Between 1801 and 1809, <a href="Johan_Christopher_Toll" title="wikilink">Johan Christopher Toll</a> was appointed Governor-General of Scania, with the county governors of Kristianstad County and Malmöhus County answering to him.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p>In the <a href="Second_Treaty_of_Brömsebro_(1645)" title="wikilink">Second Treaty of Brömsebro (1645)</a>, Sweden's representatives stipulated toll freedom in Øresund for the country, and after this point, Sweden was exempted from paying the Danish Sound Toll.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> However, this arrangement came to an end in 1720, when the <a href="Treaty_of_Frederiksborg" title="wikilink">Treaty of Frederiksborg</a> officially ended Sweden's toll-free status. Denmark continued to collect Sound Toll until 1857.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>King <a href="Charles_XII_of_Sweden" title="wikilink">Charles XII</a> took up residence in the city of <a class="uri" href="Lund" title="wikilink">Lund</a> for two years after his return to Sweden from the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Empire</a> in 1716.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="after-1720-and-the-last-peace-treaty">After 1720 and the last peace treaty</h2>

<p>The last peace treaty between Sweden and Denmark was signed in the summer of 1720<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>A <a href="land_reform" title="wikilink">land reform</a>, the so-called "Enskifte"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> was implemented at the turn of century 1700/1800. At that time the population of the province had just passed 250,000 inhabitants. <a href="Rutger_Macklean" title="wikilink">Rutger Macklean</a> was the first to enforce this largely good reform in the 1780s, at his <a href="feudalism" title="wikilink">feudal</a> domains around <a href="Svaneholm_Castle" title="wikilink">Svaneholm Castle</a>. But he also burned down the farmer's villages which later caused some unnecessary troubles when the reform was enforced generally.</p>

<p><a href="House_of_Bernadotte" title="wikilink">Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte</a>, the future king <a href="Charles_XIV_John_of_Sweden" title="wikilink">Charles XIV John</a>, landed in Helsingborg on the 20 of October 1810 on his way from <a class="uri" href="Paris" title="wikilink">Paris</a> to <a class="uri" href="Stockholm" title="wikilink">Stockholm</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1811 minor revolts broke out in different parts of Sweden due to extra conscriptions of farmers. At the <a href="Klågerupskravallerna" title="wikilink">Klågerup shootings</a> 30-40 civilians got shot to death by the military. Several hundred were taken prisoners or/and were wounded. In the aftermath two men publically first got their right hand cut off and then were beheaded at Stortorget square in Malmö. Also many others were physically punished.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<p>The first horse-drawn railway (although with wooden rails) on Swedish soil was opened in 1798 at <a class="uri" href="Höganäs" title="wikilink">Höganäs</a>, connecting the <a href="coal_mine" title="wikilink">coal mine</a> with the <a class="uri" href="harbour" title="wikilink">harbour</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> In 1856 one of the first public railways in the country opened between Malmö and Lund.</p>
