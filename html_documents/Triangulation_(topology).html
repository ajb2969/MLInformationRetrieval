<h1>Triangulation (topology)</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, <a class="uri" href="topology" title="wikilink">topology</a> generalizes the notion of <a href="triangulation_(geometry)" title="wikilink">triangulation</a> in a natural way as follows:</p>

<p>A <strong>triangulation</strong> of a <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topological space</a>

<p>Triangulation is useful in determining the properties of a topological space. For example, one can compute <a href="Homology_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">homology</a> and <a class="uri" href="cohomology" title="wikilink">cohomology</a> groups of a triangulated space using simplicial homology and cohomology theories instead of more complicated homology and cohomology theories.</p>
<h2 id="piecewise-linear-structures">Piecewise linear structures</h2>

<p>For topological <a href="manifold" title="wikilink">manifolds</a>, there is a slightly stronger notion of triangulation: a <a href="piecewise-linear_triangulation" title="wikilink">piecewise-linear triangulation</a> (sometimes just called a triangulation) is a triangulation with the extra property -- defined for dimensions 0, 1, 2, . . . inductively -- that the link of any simplex is a piecewise-linear sphere. The <em>link</em> of a simplex <em>s</em> in a simplicial complex <em>K</em> is a subcomplex of <em>K</em> consisting of the simplices <em>t</em> that are disjoint from <em>s</em> and such that both <em>s</em> and <em>t</em> are faces of some higher-dimensional simplex in <em>K</em>. For instance, in a two-dimensional piecewise-linear manifold formed by a set of vertices, edges, and triangles, the link of a vertex <em>s</em> consists of the <a href="cycle_graph" title="wikilink">cycle</a> of vertices and edges surrounding <em>s</em>: if <em>t</em> is a vertex in this cycle, it and <em>s</em> are both endpoints of an edge of <em>K</em>, and if <em>t</em> is an edge in this cycle, it and <em>s</em> are both faces of a triangle of <em>K</em>. This cycle is homeomorphic to a circle, which is a 1-dimensional sphere. But in this article the word "triangulation" is just used to mean homeomorphic to a simplicial complex.</p>

<p>For manifolds of dimension at most 4, any triangulation of a manifold is a piecewise linear triangulation: In any simplicial complex homeomorphic to a manifold, the link of any simplex can only be homeomorphic to a sphere. But in dimension <em>n</em> ≥ 5 the (<em>n</em> − 3)-fold <a href="Suspension_(topology)" title="wikilink">suspension</a> of the <a href="Poincaré_homology_sphere" title="wikilink">Poincaré sphere</a> is a topological manifold (homeomorphic to the <em>n</em>-sphere) with a triangulation that is not piecewise-linear: it has a simplex whose link is the Poincaré sphere, a three-dimensional manifold that is not homeomorphic to a sphere.</p>

<p>The question of which manifolds have piecewise-linear triangulations has led to much research in topology. <a href="Differentiable_manifold" title="wikilink">Differentiable manifolds</a> (Stewart Cairns, , <a href="Luitzen_Egbertus_Jan_Brouwer" title="wikilink">L.E.J. Brouwer</a>, <a href="Hans_Freudenthal" title="wikilink">Hans Freudenthal</a>, ) and <a href="subanalytic_set" title="wikilink">subanalytic sets</a> (<a href="Heisuke_Hironaka" title="wikilink">Heisuke Hironaka</a> and Robert Hardt) admit a piecewise-linear triangulation, technically by passing via the <a class="uri" href="PDIFF" title="wikilink">PDIFF</a> category. <a href="Topological_manifold" title="wikilink">Topological manifolds</a> of dimensions 2 and 3 are always triangulable by an <a href="Hauptvermutung" title="wikilink">essentially unique triangulation</a> (up to piecewise-linear equivalence); this was proved for <a href="surface" title="wikilink">surfaces</a> by <a href="Tibor_Radó" title="wikilink">Tibor Radó</a> in the 1920s and for <a href="three-manifold" title="wikilink">three-manifolds</a> by <a href="Edwin_E._Moise" title="wikilink">Edwin E. Moise</a> and <a href="R._H._Bing" title="wikilink">R. H. Bing</a> in the 1950s, with later simplifications by <a href="Peter_Shalen" title="wikilink">Peter Shalen</a> (, ). As shown independently by <a href="James_Munkres" title="wikilink">James Munkres</a>, <a href="Steve_Smale" title="wikilink">Steve Smale</a> and , each of these manifolds admits a <a href="smooth_structure" title="wikilink">smooth structure</a>, unique up to <a class="uri" href="diffeomorphism" title="wikilink">diffeomorphism</a> (see , ). In dimension 4, however, the <a href="E8_manifold" title="wikilink">E8 manifold</a> does not admit a triangulation, and some compact 4-manifolds have an infinite number of triangulations, all piecewise-linear inequivalent. In dimension greater than 4, <a href="Robion_Kirby" title="wikilink">Rob Kirby</a> and <a href="Larry_Siebenmann" title="wikilink">Larry Siebenmann</a> constructed manifolds that do not have <a href="piecewise_linear_manifold" title="wikilink">piecewise-linear</a> triangulations (see <a class="uri" href="Hauptvermutung" title="wikilink">Hauptvermutung</a>). Further, <a href="Ciprian_Manolescu" title="wikilink">Ciprian Manolescu</a> proved that there exist compact manifolds of dimension 5 (and hence of every dimension greater than 5) that are not homeomorphic to a simplicial complex, i.e., that do not admit a triangulation ().</p>
<h2 id="explicit-methods-of-triangulation">Explicit methods of triangulation</h2>

<p>An important special case of topological triangulation is that of two-dimensional surfaces, or <a href="Manifold" title="wikilink">closed 2-manifolds</a>. There is a standard proof that smooth closed surfaces can be triangulated (see Jost 1997). Indeed, if the surface is given a <a href="Riemannian_metric" title="wikilink">Riemannian metric</a>, each point <em>x</em> is contained inside a small convex <a class="uri" href="geodesic" title="wikilink">geodesic</a> triangle lying inside a <a href="geodesic_normal_coordinates" title="wikilink">normal ball</a> with centre <em>x</em>. The interiors of finitely many of the triangles will cover the surface; since edges of different triangles either coincide or intersect transversally, this finite set of triangles can be used iteratively to construct a triangulation.</p>

<p>Another simple procedure for triangulating differentiable manifolds was given by <a href="Hassler_Whitney" title="wikilink">Hassler Whitney</a> in 1957, based on his <a href="Whitney_embedding_theorem" title="wikilink">embedding theorem</a>. In fact, if <em>X</em> is a closed <em>n</em>-<a class="uri" href="submanifold" title="wikilink">submanifold</a> of <em>R</em><sup>m</sup>, subdivide a cubical lattice in <em>R</em><sup>m</sup> into simplices to give a triangulation of <em>R</em><sup>m</sup>. By taking the <a href="mesh_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">mesh</a> of the lattice small enough and slightly moving finitely many of the vertices, the triangulation will be in <em>general position</em> with respect to <em>X</em>: thus no simplices of dimension m, lying wholly inside the tubular neighbourhood. The triangulation is given by the projection of this simplicial complex onto <em>X</em>.</p>
<h2 id="graphs-on-surfaces">Graphs on surfaces</h2>

<p>A <em>Whitney triangulation</em> or <em>clean triangulation</em> of a <a class="uri" href="surface" title="wikilink">surface</a> is an embedding of a graph onto the surface in such a way that the faces of the embedding are exactly the <a href="clique_(graph_theory)" title="wikilink">cliques</a> of the graph (Hartsfeld and <a href="Gerhard_Ringel" title="wikilink">Gerhard Ringel</a> 1981; Larrión et al. 2002; Malnič and Mohar 1992). Equivalently, every face is a triangle, every triangle is a face, and the graph is not itself a clique. The <a href="clique_complex" title="wikilink">clique complex</a> of the graph is then homeomorphic to the surface. The 1-<a href="Skeleton_(topology)" title="wikilink">skeletons</a> of Whitney triangulations are exactly the <a href="Neighbourhood_(graph_theory)" title="wikilink">locally cyclic graphs</a> other than <em>K</em><sub>4</sub>.</p>
