<h1>Linear function (calculus)</h1>
<hr/>
<p> In <a class="uri" href="calculus" title="wikilink">calculus</a> and related areas of mathematics, a <strong>linear function</strong> from the real numbers to the real numbers is a function whose graph (in <a href="Cartesian_coordinates" title="wikilink">Cartesian coordinates</a> with uniform scales) is a <a href="line_(geometry)" title="wikilink">line</a> in the plane.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Their characteristic property that when the value of the input variable is changed, the change in the output is a constant multiple of the change in the input variable.</p>
<p>Linear functions are related to <a href="linear_equation" title="wikilink">linear equations</a>.</p>
<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>
<p>A linear function is a <a href="polynomial_function" title="wikilink">polynomial function</a> in which the <a href="variable_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">variable</a> <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> has degree at most one, which means it is of the form<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<dl>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$ f ( x ) = ax + b size=120%$</span>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> is the variable. The <a href="graph_of_a_function" title="wikilink">graph</a> of a linear function, that is, the set of all points whose coordinates have the form <span class="LaTeX">$( x , f ( x ))$</span>, is a <a href="line_(geometry)" title="wikilink">line</a> on the <a href="Cartesian_plane" title="wikilink">Cartesian plane</a> (if over real numbers). That is why this type of <a href="Function_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">function</a> is called <em>linear</em>. Some authors, for various reasons, also require that the coefficient of the variable (the <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$ax + b$</span>) should not be zero.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> This requirement can also be expressed by saying that the degree of the polynomial defining the function is exactly one, or by saying that the line which is the graph of a linear function is a <em>slanted</em> line (neither vertical nor horizontal). This requirement will not be imposed in this article, thus constant functions, <span class="LaTeX">$ f ( x ) = b$</span>, will be considered to be linear functions (their graphs are horizontal lines).</p>
<p>The <a href="Domain_of_a_function" title="wikilink">domain</a> or set of allowed values for <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> of a linear function is the entire set of <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real numbers</a> <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ R } $</span>, or whatever <a href="field_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">field</a> that is in use. This means that any (real) number can be substituted for <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>.</p>
<p>Because two different points determine a line, it is enough to substitute two different values for <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> in the linear function and determine <span class="LaTeX">$f ( x )$</span> for each of these values. This will give the coordinates of two different points that lie on the line. Because <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> is a function, this line will not be vertical. If the value of either or both of the coefficient letters <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$b$</span> are changed, a different line is obtained.</p>
<p>Since the graph of a linear function is a nonvertical line, this line has exactly one intersection point with the <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span>-axis. This point is <span class="LaTeX">$(0, b )$</span>.</p>
<p>The graph of a nonconstant linear function has exactly one intersection point with the <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>-axis. This point is <span class="LaTeX">$( −\frac{b}{a} , 0)$</span>. From this, it follows that a nonconstant linear function has exactly one <a href="zero_of_a_function" title="wikilink">zero</a> or root. That is, there is exactly one solution to the equation <mtpl></mtpl>. The zero is <mtpl></mtpl> <span class="LaTeX">$−\frac{b}{a}$</span>.</p>
<h2 id="slope">Slope</h2>
<p> The <a href="slope_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">slope</a> of a nonvertical line is a number that measures how steeply the line is slanted. The <a href="first_derivative" title="wikilink">first derivative</a> of a linear function, in the sense of calculus, is exactly this slope of the graph of the function. For <span class="LaTeX">$ f ( x ) = ax + b$</span>, this slope and derivative is given by the constant <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span>. Linear functions can be characterized as the only real-valued functions that are defined on the entire real line and have a <a href="constant_function" title="wikilink">constant</a> derivative.</p>
<p>The derivative of a function, in general, measures its rate of change. Because a linear function <span class="LaTeX">$ f ( x ) = ax + b$</span> has a constant rate of change <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span>, it has the property that whenever the input <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> is increased by one unit, the output changes by <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span> units. If <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span> is positive, this will cause the value of the function to increase, while if <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span> is negative it will cause the value to decrease. More generally, if the input increases by some other amount, <span class="LaTeX">$c$</span>, the output changes by <span class="LaTeX">$ca$</span>.</p>
<h2 id="relationship-with-linear-equations">Relationship with linear equations</h2>
<p> The points on a line have coordinates which can also be thought of as the solutions of <a href="linear_equation" title="wikilink">linear equations</a> in two variables (the equation of the line). These solution sets define functions which are linear functions. This connection between linear equations and linear functions provides the most common way to produce linear functions.</p>
<p>The <a class="uri" href="equation" title="wikilink">equation</a> <span class="LaTeX">$ y = ax + b$</span> is referred to as the slope-intercept form of a linear equation. In this form, the variable is <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>, and <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span>, is the value of the function. It also has two coefficients, <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$b$</span>. In this instance, the fact that the values of <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span> depend on the values of <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> is an expression of the functional relationship between them. To be very explicit, the linear equation is expressing the equality of values of the dependent variable <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span> with the functional values of the linear function <span class="LaTeX">$ f ( x ) = ax + b$</span>, in other words <span class="LaTeX">$ y = f ( x )$</span> for this particular linear function <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span>.</p>
<p>If the linear function <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> is given, the linear equation of the graph of this function is obtained by <em>defining</em> the variable <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span> to be the functional value <span class="LaTeX">$f ( x )$</span>, that is, setting <span class="LaTeX">$ y = f ( x ) = ax + b$</span> and suppressing the functional notation in the middle. Starting with a linear equation, one can create linear functions, but this is a more subtle operation and must be done with care. Why this is so is not immediately apparent when the linear equation has the slope-intercept form, so this discussion will be postponed. For the moment observe that if the linear equation has the slope-intercept form, then the expression that the dependent variable <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span> is equal to is the linear function whose graph is the line satisfying the linear equation.</p>
<p>The constant <span class="LaTeX">$b$</span> is the so-called <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span>-intercept. It is the <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span>-value at which the line intersects the <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span>-axis. The coefficient <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span> is the <a class="uri" href="slope" title="wikilink">slope</a> of the line. This measures of the rate of change of the linear function associated with the line. Since <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span> is a constant, this rate of change is constant. Moving from any point on the line to the right by one unit (that is, increasing <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> by 1), the <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span>-value of the point's coordinate changes by <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span>. This is expressed functionally by the statement that <span class="LaTeX">$ f ( x + 1) = f ( x ) + a$</span> when <span class="LaTeX">$ f ( x ) = ax + b$</span>.</p>
<p>For example, the slope-intercept form <span class="LaTeX">$ y = −2 x + 4$</span> has <span class="LaTeX">$ a = −2$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$ b = 4$</span>. The point <span class="LaTeX">$(0, b ) = (0, 4)$</span> is the intersection of the line and the <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span>-axis, the point <span class="LaTeX">$( −\frac{b}{a} , 0) =$</span> <span class="LaTeX">$( \frac{−4}{−2} , 0) = (2, 0)$</span> is the intersection of the line and the <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>-axis, and <span class="LaTeX">$ a = −2$</span> is the slope of the line. For every step to the right (<span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> increases by 1), the value of <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span> changes by −2 (goes down).</p>
<p> If the linear equation in the general form</p>
<dl>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$ Ax + By = C size=120%$</span>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>has <span class="LaTeX">$B ≠ 0$</span>, then it may be solved for the variable <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span> and thus used to define a linear function, namely, <span class="LaTeX">$ y = −( \frac{A}{B} ) x + ( \frac{C}{B} ) = f ( x )$</span>. While all lines have equations in the general form, only the non-vertical lines have equations which can give rise to linear functions.</p>
<h2 id="relationship-with-other-classes-of-functions">Relationship with other classes of functions</h2>
<p>If the coefficient of the variable is not zero (<span class="LaTeX">$a ≠ 0$</span>), then a linear function is represented by a <a href="degree_of_a_polynomial" title="wikilink">degree</a> 1 <a class="uri" href="polynomial" title="wikilink">polynomial</a> (also called a <em>linear polynomial</em>), otherwise it is a <a href="constant_function" title="wikilink">constant function</a> – also a polynomial function, but of zero degree.</p>
<p>A straight line, when drawn in a different kind of coordinate system may represent other functions.</p>
<p>For example, it may represent an <a href="exponential_growth" title="wikilink">exponential function</a> when its <a href="codomain" title="wikilink">values</a> are expressed in the <a href="logarithmic_scale" title="wikilink">logarithmic scale</a>. It means that when <span class="LaTeX">$log ( g ( x ))$</span> is a linear function of <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>, the function <span class="LaTeX">$g$</span> is exponential. With linear functions, increasing the input by one unit causes the output to increase by a fixed amount, which is the slope of the graph of the function. With exponential functions, increasing the input by one unit causes the output to increase by a fixed multiple, which is known as the base of the exponential function.</p>
<p>If <em>both</em> <a href="domain_of_a_function" title="wikilink">arguments</a> and values of a function are in the logarithmic scale (i.e., when <span class="LaTeX">$log ( y )$</span> is a linear function of <span class="LaTeX">$log ( x )$</span>), then the straight line represents a <a href="power_law" title="wikilink">power law</a>:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\log_r y = a \log_r x + b \quad\Rightarrow\quad y = r^b\cdot x^a$$</span></p>
<p>On the other hand, the graph of a linear function in terms of <a href="polar_coordinates" title="wikilink">polar coordinates</a>:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$r =f(\varphi ) = a\varphi  + b$$</span></p>
<p>is an <a href="Archimedean_spiral" title="wikilink">Archimedean spiral</a> if <span class="LaTeX">$a \neq 0$</span> and a <a class="uri" href="circle" title="wikilink">circle</a> otherwise.</p>
