<h1>Impairment cost</h1>
<hr/>
<p>An <strong>Impairment cost</strong> must be included under expenses when the <a href="book_value" title="wikilink">book value</a> of a <a href="non-current_asset" title="wikilink">non-current asset</a> exceeds the recoverable amount. Impairment of assets is the diminishing in quality, strength amount, or value of an asset. <a href="Fixed_assets" title="wikilink">Fixed assets</a>, commonly known as PPE, refers to long-lived assets such as buildings, land, machinery, and equipment; these assets are the most likely to experience impairment, which may be caused by several factors.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Under <a class="uri" href="IFRS" title="wikilink">IFRS</a>, the Impairment cost is calculated using two methods:</p>
<p>:*The Incurred Loss Model;</p>
<p>:*Expected Loss Model</p>
<h2 id="incurred-loss-model">Incurred Loss Model</h2>
<p>Under the incurred loss model, investments are recognized as impaired when there is no longer reasonable assurance that the <a href="Cash_flow" title="wikilink">future cash flows</a> associated with them will be either collected in their entirety or when due. Entities look for evidence of situations that would indicate impairment, such triggering events include when the entity:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>:*is experiencing notable financial difficulties,</p>
<p>:*has defaulted on or is late making interest payments or principal payments,</p>
<p>:*is likely to undergo a major financial reorganization or enter bankruptcy, or</p>
<p>:*is in a market that is experiencing significant negative economic change.</p>
<h3 id="calculating-impairment-cost">Calculating Impairment Cost</h3>
<p>If such evidence exists, the next step is to estimate the investments recoverable amount. The <strong>Impairment cost</strong> would then be calculated by using the formula:</p>
<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$\mbox{Impairment Cost} = {\mbox{Recoverable Amount} - \mbox{Carrying Value}}$</span>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The carrying value is defined as the value of the asset as displayed on the <a href="balance_sheet" title="wikilink">balance sheet</a>. The recoverable amount is the higher of either the asset's <a href="future_value" title="wikilink">future value</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> for the company or the amount it can be sold for, minus any <a href="transaction_costs" title="wikilink">transaction costs</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="expected-loss-model">Expected Loss Model</h2>
<p>Under an expected loss impairment model, estimates of <a href="Cash_flow" title="wikilink">future cash flows</a> used to determine the present value of the investment are made on a continuous basis and do not rely on a triggering event to occur. Even though there may be no objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, revised cash flow projections may indicate changes in <a href="credit_risk" title="wikilink">credit risk</a>. Under the expected loss model, these revised expected cash flows are <a class="uri" href="discounted" title="wikilink">discounted</a> at the same effective interest rate used when the instrument was first acquired, therefore retaining a <a href="Historical_cost" title="wikilink">cost-based measurement</a>. Calculating the <strong>Impairment cost</strong> is the same as the Incurred Loss Model.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>For example, assume a company has an investment in Company A bonds with a carrying amount of $37,500. If the <a href="market_value" title="wikilink">market value</a> of the bonds falls to $33,000, an impairment loss of $4,500 is indicated. Therefore an Impairment cost is calculated:</p>
<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$$37500-$33000 = $4500$</span>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is recorded as a loss of $4,500 in the <a href="income_statement" title="wikilink">income statement</a>. Using the <a href='Debits_and_credits#"T"_accounts' title="wikilink">'T' account</a> system, there will be a debit in the Loss on Impairment account and a credit in the Investment account. This will mean the <a href="double-entry_bookkeeping" title="wikilink">double-entry bookkeeping</a> principle is satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>Debit:</strong> Loss on Impairment $4,500</p>
<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd><strong>Credit:</strong> Investment $4,500<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="effect-on-depreciation">Effect on depreciation</h3>
<p>To calculate <a class="uri" href="depreciation" title="wikilink">depreciation</a> on the asset, the new non-current asset value is considered. Continuing with the previous example, if using the <a href="Depreciation#Methods_of_depreciation" title="wikilink">Straight line Depreciation</a> method at say, 20%, then depreciation would be:</p>
<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$$33000*0.2=$6600$</span>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Therefore there is a smaller depreciation charge than if the original non-current asset value had been used.</p>
<h2 id="consequent-asset-value-increases">Consequent asset value increases</h2>
<p>Reversals of impairment losses are required for investments in <a href="Bond_market" title="wikilink">debt instruments</a>, but no reversals are permitted under <a class="uri" href="IFRS" title="wikilink">IFRS</a> for any impairment changes recognized in net income for equity instruments accounted for in <a href="Other_Comprehensive_Income" title="wikilink">OCI</a>; however, subsequent changes in the equity investment's fair value are recognized in <a href="Other_Comprehensive_Income" title="wikilink">OCI</a>.</p>
