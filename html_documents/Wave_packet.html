<h1>Wave packet</h1>
<hr/>
<p>  In physics, a <strong>wave packet</strong> (or <strong>wave train</strong>) is a short "burst" or "<a href="Wave_envelope" title="wikilink">envelope</a>" of localized wave action that travels as a unit. A wave packet can be analyzed into, or can be synthesized from, an infinite set of component <a href="sinusoidal_wave" title="wikilink">sinusoidal waves</a> of different <a href="wavenumber" title="wikilink">wavenumbers</a>, with phases and amplitudes such that they interfere constructively only over a small region of space, and destructively elsewhere.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Each component <a href="wave_function" title="wikilink">wave function</a>, and hence the wave packet, are solutions of a <a href="wave_equation" title="wikilink">wave equation</a>. Depending on the wave equation, the wave packet's profile may remain constant (no <a href="Dispersion_(water_waves)" title="wikilink">dispersion</a>, see figure) or it may change (dispersion) while propagating.</p>
<p><a href="Quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">Quantum mechanics</a> ascribes a special significance to the wave packet; it is interpreted as a <a href="probability_amplitude" title="wikilink">probability amplitude</a>, its <a href="Wave_function#Position-space_wave_function" title="wikilink">norm squared</a> describing the <a href="probability_density" title="wikilink">probability density</a> that a particle or particles in a particular state will be measured to have a given position or momentum. The wave equation is in this case the <a href="Schrödinger_equation" title="wikilink">Schrödinger equation</a>. It is possible to deduce the <a href="time_evolution" title="wikilink">time evolution</a> of a quantum mechanical system, similar to the process of the <a href="Hamiltonian_mechanics" title="wikilink">Hamiltonian</a> formalism in <a href="classical_mechanics" title="wikilink">classical mechanics</a>. The dispersive character of solutions of the Schrödinger equation has played an important role in rejecting <a href="Schrödinger_equation#Historical_background_and_development" title="wikilink">Schrödinger's original interpretation</a>, and accepting the <a href="Born_rule" title="wikilink">Born rule</a>.</p>
<p>In the coordinate representation of the wave (such as the <a href="Cartesian_coordinate_system" title="wikilink">Cartesian coordinate system</a>), the position of the physical object's localized probability is specified by the position of the packet solution. Moreover, the narrower the spatial wave packet, and therefore the better localized the position of the wave packet, the larger the spread in the <a class="uri" href="momentum" title="wikilink">momentum</a> of the wave. This trade-off between spread in position and spread in momentum is a characteristic feature of the <a href="Werner_Heisenberg" title="wikilink">Heisenberg</a> <a href="uncertainty_principle" title="wikilink">uncertainty principle</a>, and will be illustrated below.</p>
<h2 id="historical-background">Historical background</h2>
<p>In the early 1900s, it became apparent that classical mechanics had some major failings. <a href="Isaac_Newton" title="wikilink">Isaac Newton</a> originally proposed the idea that light came in discrete packets, which he called <strong>corpuscles</strong>, but the wave-like behavior of many light phenomena quickly led scientists to favor a wave description of <a class="uri" href="electromagnetism" title="wikilink">electromagnetism</a>. It wasn't until the 1930s that the particle nature of light really began to be widely accepted in physics. The development of quantum mechanics — and its success at explaining confusing experimental results — was at the root of this acceptance. Thus, one of the basic concepts in the formulation of quantum mechanics is that of light coming in discrete bundles called <a class="uri" href="photons" title="wikilink">photons</a>. The energy of light photon is a function of its frequency,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$E = h\nu.$$</span><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The photon's energy is equal to <a href="Planck's_constant" title="wikilink">Planck's constant</a>, <span class="LaTeX">$h$</span>, multiplied by its frequency, <span class="LaTeX">$ν$</span>. This resolved a problem in classical physics, called the <a href="ultraviolet_catastrophe" title="wikilink">ultraviolet catastrophe</a>.</p>
<p>The ideas of quantum mechanics continued to be developed throughout the 20th century. The picture that was developed was of a particulate world, with all phenomena and matter made of and interacting with discrete particles; however, these particles were described by a probability wave. The interactions, locations, and all of physics would be reduced to the calculations of these probability amplitudes. The particle-like nature of the world has been confirmed by experiment over a century, while the wave-like phenomena could be characterized as consequences of the wave packet aspect of quantum particles, see <a href="wave-particle_duality" title="wikilink">wave-particle duality</a>. According to the <a href="principle_of_complementarity" title="wikilink">principle of complementarity</a>, the wave-like and particle-like characteristics never manifest themselves at the same time, i.e. in the same experiment — see however the <a href="Afshar_experiment" title="wikilink">Afshar experiment</a> and the lively discussion around it.</p>

<h3 id="non-dispersive">Non-dispersive</h3>
<p>As an example of propagation <em>without dispersion</em>, consider wave solutions to the following <a href="wave_equation" title="wikilink">wave equation</a> from <a href="classical_physics" title="wikilink">classical physics</a></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$${ \partial^2 u \over \partial t^2 } = c^2 { \nabla^2 u},$$</span></p>
<p>where <span class="LaTeX">$c$</span> is the speed of the wave's propagation in a given medium.</p>
<p>Using the physics time convention, <span class="LaTeX">$exp(− iωt )$</span>, the wave equation has <a class="uri" href="plane-wave" title="wikilink">plane-wave</a> solutions</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$u(\bold{x},t) = e^{i{(\bold{k\cdot x}}-\omega t)},$$</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\omega^2 =|\bold{k}|^2 c^2$$</span>, and <span class="LaTeX">$|\bold{k}|^2 = k_x^2 + k_y^2+ k_z^2.$</span></p>
<p>This relation between <span class="LaTeX">$ω$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ k } $</span> should be valid so that the plane wave is a solution to the wave equation. It is called a <a href="dispersion_relation" title="wikilink">dispersion relation</a>.</p>
<p>To simplify, consider only waves propagating in one dimension (extension to three dimensions is straightforward). Then the general solution is</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$u(x,t)= A e^{i(kx-\omega t)} + B e^{-i(kx+\omega t)},$$</span> in which we may take <span class="LaTeX">$ω = kc$</span>. The first term represents a wave propagating in the positive  since it is a function of <span class="LaTeX">$x − ct$</span> only; the second term, being a function of <span class="LaTeX">$x + ct$</span>, represents a wave propagating in the negative .</p>
<p>A wave packet is a localized disturbance that results from the sum of many different <a href="wave_form" title="wikilink">wave forms</a>. If the packet is strongly localized, more frequencies are needed to allow the constructive superposition in the region of localization and destructive superposition outside the region. From the basic solutions in one dimension, a general form of a wave packet can be expressed as</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$u(x,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int^{\,\infty}_{-\infty} A(k) ~ e^{i(kx-\omega(k)t)}dk.$$</span></p>
<p>As in the plane-wave case the wave packet travels to the right for <span class="LaTeX">$ω(k) = kc$</span>, since <span class="LaTeX">$u(x, t) = F(x − ct)$</span>, and to the left for <span class="LaTeX">$ω(k) = −kc$</span>, since <span class="LaTeX">$u(x,t) = F(x + ct)$</span>.</p>
<p>The factor <span class="LaTeX">${1}/$</span> comes from <a href="Fourier_transform" title="wikilink">Fourier transform</a> conventions. The amplitude <span class="LaTeX">$A(k)$</span> contains the coefficients of the linear superposition of the plane-wave solutions. These coefficients can in turn be expressed as a function of <span class="LaTeX">$u(x, t)$</span> evaluated at <span class="LaTeX">$t = 0$</span> by inverting the Fourier transform relation above:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$A(k) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int^{\,\infty}_{-\infty} u(x,0) ~ e^{-ikx}dx.$$</span></p>
<p>For instance, choosing</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$u(x,0) = e^{-x^2 +ik_0x},$$</span></p>
<p>we obtain</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$A(k) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} e^{-\frac{(k-k_0)^2}{4}},$$</span></p>
<p>and finally</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$u(x,t) = e^{-(x-ct)^2 +ik_0(x-ct)} = e^{-(x-ct)^2} \left[\cos\left(2\pi \frac{x-ct}{\lambda}\right) + i\sin\left(2\pi\frac{x-ct}{\lambda}\right)\right].$$</span></p>
<p>The imaginary part is a sine wave with perpendicular polarisation to the cosine wave. The nondispersive propagation of the real or imaginary part of this wave packet is presented in the above animation.</p>
<h3 id="dispersive">Dispersive</h3>
<p>By contrast, as an example of propagation now <em>with dispersion</em>, consider instead solutions to the <a href="Schrödinger_equation" title="wikilink">Schrödinger equation</a> (with <em>m</em> and ħ set equal to one),</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$i{ \partial u \over \partial t } = -\frac{1}{2} { \nabla^2 u },$$</span> yielding the dispersion relation</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\omega = \frac{1}{2}|\bold{k}|^2.$$</span></p>
<p>Once again, restricting attention to one dimension, the solution to the Schrödinger equation satisfying the initial condition <mtpl> exp(−<em>x²+ik<sub>o</sub>x</em>) }}</mtpl>, representing a wave packet localized in space at the origin, is seen to be</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$u(x,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + 2it}} e^{-\frac{1}{4}k_0^2} ~ e^{-\frac{1}{1 + 2it}\left(x - \frac{ik_0}{2}\right)^2}
               = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + 2it}} e^{-\frac{1}{1 + 4t^2}(x - k_0t)^2}~ e^{i \frac{1}{1 + 4t^2}\left((k_0 + 2tx)x - \frac{1}{2}tk_0^2\right)} ~.$$</span></p>
<p>An impression of the dispersive behavior of this wave packet is obtained by looking at the probability density,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$|u(x,t)|^2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+4t^2}}~e^{-\frac{2(x-k_0t)^2}{1+4t^2}}~.$$</span> It is evident that this dispersive wave packet, while moving with constant <a href="group_velocity" title="wikilink">group velocity</a> <mtpl></mtpl>, is delocalizing rapidly: it has a <a href="Gaussian_function" title="wikilink">width</a> increasing with time as <span class="LaTeX">$ → 2 t$</span>, so eventually it diffuses to an unlimited region of space.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="gaussian-wave-packets-in-quantum-mechanics">Gaussian wave packets in quantum mechanics</h2>
<p>The above dispersive Gaussian wave packet, unnormalized and just centered at the origin, instead, at <span class="LaTeX">$t$</span>=0, can now be written in 3D:,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\psi(\bold{r},0) = e^{-\bold{r}\cdot\bold{r}/ 2a},$$</span> where <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span> is a positive real number, the <em>square of the width of the wave packet</em>, <mtpl> 2⟨<strong>r·r</strong>⟩/3⟨1⟩ {{=}} 2 (<em>Δx</em>)<sup>2</sup>}}</mtpl>.</p>
<p>The Fourier transform is also a Gaussian in terms of the wavenumber, <span class="LaTeX">$t$</span>=0, the <strong>k</strong>-vector, (with inverse width, <mtpl> 2⟨<strong>k·k</strong>⟩/3⟨1⟩ {{=}} 2 (<em>Δp<sub>x</sub>/ħ</em>)<sup>2</sup>}}</mtpl>, so that <mtpl>ħ''/2}}</mtpl>, i.e. it saturates the <a href="uncertainty_relation" title="wikilink">uncertainty relation</a>),</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\psi(\bold{k},0) = (2\pi a)^{3/2} e^{- a \bold{k}\cdot\bold{k}/2}.$$</span></p>
<p>Each separate wave only phase-rotates in time, so that the time dependent Fourier-transformed solution is</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\begin{align}\Psi(\bold{k}, t) &= (2\pi a)^{3/2} e^{- a \bold{k}\cdot\bold{k}/2 }e^{-iEt/\hbar} \\
&= (2\pi a)^{3/2} e^{- a \bold{k}\cdot\bold{k}/2 - i(\hbar^2 \bold{k}\cdot\bold{k}/2m)t/\hbar} \\
&= (2\pi a)^{3/2} e^{-(a+i\hbar t/m)\bold{k}\cdot\bold{k}/2}.\end{align}$$</span> The inverse Fourier transform is still a Gaussian, but now the parameter <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span> has become complex, and there is an overall normalization factor.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\Psi(\bold{r},t) = \left({a \over a + i\hbar t/m}\right)^{3/2} e^{- {\bold{r}\cdot\bold{r}\over 2(a + i\hbar t/m)} }.$$</span></p>
<p>The integral of <span class="LaTeX">$Ψ$</span> over all space is invariant, because it is the inner product of <span class="LaTeX">$Ψ$</span> with the state of zero energy, which is a wave with infinite wavelength, a constant function of space. For any <a href="eigenstate" title="wikilink">energy eigenstate</a> <span class="LaTeX">$η ( x )$</span>, the inner product,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\langle \eta | \psi \rangle = \int \eta(\bold{r}) \psi(\bold{r})d^3\bold{r},$$</span> only changes in time in a simple way: its phase rotates with a frequency determined by the energy of <span class="LaTeX">$η$</span>. When <span class="LaTeX">$η$</span> has zero energy, like the infinite wavelength wave, it doesn't change at all.</p>
<p>The integral <mtpl><em>Ψ</em>{{!}}<sup>2</sup><em>d</em><sup>3</sup><em>r</em>}}</mtpl> is also invariant, which is a statement of the conservation of probability. Explicitly,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$P(r)=  |\Psi|^2 = \Psi^*\Psi = \left( {a \over \sqrt{a^2+(\hbar t/m)^2} }\right)^3  ~ e^{-{\bold{r}\cdot\bold{r} a \over a^2 + (\hbar t/m)^2}},$$</span> in which √<span class="LaTeX">$a$</span> is the width of <span class="LaTeX">$P(r)$</span> at <span class="LaTeX">$t = 0$</span>; <span class="LaTeX">$r$</span> is the distance from the origin; the speed of the particle is zero; and the time origin <span class="LaTeX">$t = 0$</span> can be chosen arbitrarily.</p>
<p>The width of the Gaussian is the interesting quantity which can be read off from the probability density, <mtpl><em>Ψ</em>{{!}}<sup>2</sup>}}</mtpl>,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\sqrt{a^2 + (\hbar t/m)^2 \over a}.$$</span> This width eventually grows linearly in time, as <span class="LaTeX">$ħt/(m√a)$</span>, indicating <strong>wave-packet spreading</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, if an electron wave packet is initially localized in a region of atomic dimensions (i.e., <mtpl></mtpl> m) then the width of the packet doubles in about <mtpl></mtpl> s. Clearly, particle wave packets spread out very rapidly indeed (in free space):<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> For instance, after <span class="LaTeX">$1$</span> ms, the width will have grown to about a kilometer.</p>
<p>This linear growth is a reflection of the momentum uncertainty: the wave packet is confined to a narrow <span class="LaTeX">$Δx = $</span>, and so has a momentum which is uncertain (according to the <a href="uncertainty_principle" title="wikilink">uncertainty principle</a>) by the amount <span class="LaTeX">$ħ / $</span>, a spread in velocity of <span class="LaTeX">$ħ/m $</span>, and thus in the future position by <span class="LaTeX">$ħt /m $</span>. The uncertainty relation is then a strict inequality, very far from saturation, indeed! The initial uncertainty <span class="LaTeX">$ΔxΔp = ħ /2$</span> has now increased by a factor of <span class="LaTeX">$ħt/ma$</span>.</p>
<h2 id="the-airy-wave-train">The Airy wave train</h2>
<p>In contrast to the above Gaussian wave packet, it has been observed<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> that a particular wave function based on <a href="Airy_function" title="wikilink">Airy functions</a>, propagates freely without envelope dispersion, maintaining its shape. It accelerates undistorted in the absence of a force field: <span class="LaTeX">$ψ = Ai( B ( x − B ³ t ²)) exp(i B ³ t ( x −2 B ³ t ²/3))$</span>. (For simplicity, <span class="LaTeX">$ħ$</span>=1, <em>m</em>=1/2, and <em>B</em> is a constant, cf. <a class="uri" href="nondimensionalization" title="wikilink">nondimensionalization</a>.)</p>
<p> Nevertheless, <a href="Ehrenfest's_theorem" title="wikilink">Ehrenfest's theorem</a> is still valid in this force-free situation, because the state is both non-normalizable and has an undefined (infinite) <span class="LaTeX">$⟨ x ⟩$</span> for all times. (To the extent that it can be defined, <span class="LaTeX">$⟨ p ⟩ = 0$</span> for all times, despite the apparent acceleration of the front.)</p>
<p>In <a href="phase_space" title="wikilink">phase space</a>, this is evident in the <a href="pure_state" title="wikilink">pure state</a> <a href="Wigner_quasiprobability_distribution" title="wikilink">Wigner quasiprobability distribution</a> of this wavetrain, whose shape in <em>x</em> and <em>p</em> is invariant as time progresses, but whose features accelerate to the right, in accelerating parabolas <span class="LaTeX">$B ( x − B ³ t ²) + ( p/B − tB ²)² = 0$</span>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$W(x,p;t)=W(x-B^3 t^2, p-B^3 t ;0)={1\over 2^{1/3} \pi B} ~  \mathrm{Ai} \left(2^{2/3} \left(Bx + {p^2\over B^2}- 2Bpt\right)\right).$$</span></p>
<p>Note the momentum distribution obtained by integrating over all <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> is constant. Since this is the <a href="Wigner_quasiprobability_distribution#Mathematical_properties" title="wikilink">probability density in momentum space</a>, it is evident that the wave function itself is not normalizable.</p>
<h2 id="free-propagator">Free propagator</h2>
<p>The narrow-width limit of the Gaussian wave packet solution discussed is the free <a href="Propagator#Propagator_of_Free_Particle_and_Harmonic_Oscillator" title="wikilink"><strong><em>propagator kernel</em></strong></a> <span class="LaTeX">$K$</span>. For other differential equations, this is usually called the Green's function,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> but in quantum mechanics it is traditional to reserve the name Green's function for the time Fourier transform of <span class="LaTeX">$K$</span>.</p>
<p>Returning to one dimension for simplicity, when <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span> is the infinitesimal quantity <span class="LaTeX">$ε$</span>, the Gaussian initial condition, rescaled so that its integral is one,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\psi_0(x) = {1\over \sqrt{2\pi \epsilon} } e^{-{x^2\over 2\epsilon}} \,$$</span> becomes a <a href="Dirac_delta_function#" title="wikilink">delta function</a>, <span class="LaTeX">$δ(x)$</span>, so that its time evolution,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$K_t(x) = {1\over \sqrt{2\pi (i t + \epsilon)}} e^{ - x^2 \over 2it+\epsilon }\,$$</span> yields the propagator.</p>
<p>Note that a very narrow initial wave packet instantly becomes infinitely wide, but with a phase which is more rapidly oscillatory at large values of <em>x</em>. This might seem strange—the solution goes from being localized at one point to being "everywhere" at <em>all later times</em>, but it is a reflection of the enormous <a href="uncertainty_principle" title="wikilink">momentum uncertainty</a> of a localized particle, as explained above.</p>
<p>Further note that the norm of the wave function is infinite, which is also correct, since the square of a <a href="Dirac_delta_function" title="wikilink">delta function</a> is divergent in the same way.</p>
<p>The factor involving <span class="LaTeX">$ε$</span> is an infinitesimal quantity which is there to make sure that integrals over <span class="LaTeX">$K$</span> are well defined. In the limit that <em>ε</em>→0, <span class="LaTeX">$K$</span> becomes purely oscillatory, and integrals of <span class="LaTeX">$K$</span> are not absolutely convergent. In the remainder of this section, it <em>will</em> be set to zero, but in order for all the integrations over intermediate states to be well defined, the limit <em>ε</em>→0 is to be only taken after the final state is calculated.</p>
<p>The propagator is the amplitude for reaching point <em>x</em> at time <em>t</em>, when starting at the origin, <em>x</em>=0. By translation invariance, the amplitude for reaching a point <em>x</em> when starting at point <em>y</em> is the same function, only now translated,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$K_t(x,y) = K_t(x-y) = {1\over \sqrt{2\pi it}} e^{-i(x-y)^2 \over 2t}  \,  .$$</span></p>
<p>In the limit when <em>t</em> is small, the propagator, of course, goes to a delta function,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\lim_{t\rightarrow 0} K_t(x-y) = \delta(x-y) ~,$$</span> but only in the sense of <a href="Distribution_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">distributions</a>: The integral of this quantity multiplied by an arbitrary differentiable <a href="test_function" title="wikilink">test function</a> gives the value of the test function at zero.</p>
<p>To see this, note that the integral over all space of <span class="LaTeX">$K$</span> equals 1 at all times,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_x K_t(x) = 1 \, ,$$</span> since this integral is the inner-product of <em>K</em> with the uniform wave function. But the phase factor in the exponent has a nonzero spatial derivative everywhere except at the origin, and so when the time is small there are fast phase cancellations at all but one point. This is rigorously true when the limit <em>ε</em>→0 is taken at the very end.</p>
<p>So the propagation kernel is the (future) time evolution of a delta function, and it is continuous, in a sense: it goes to the initial delta function at small times. If the initial wave function is an infinitely narrow spike at position <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span>,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\psi_0(x) = \delta(x - y) \, ,$$</span> it becomes the oscillatory wave,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\psi_t(x) = {1\over \sqrt{2\pi i t}} e^{ -i (x-y) ^2 /2t} \,  .$$</span></p>
<p>Now, since every function can be written as a weighted sum of such narrow spikes,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\psi_0(x) = \int_y \psi_0(y) \delta(x-y) \,  ,$$</span> the time evolution of <em>every function</em> <span class="LaTeX">$ψ$</span><sub>0</sub> is determined by this propagation kernel <span class="LaTeX">$K$</span>,  e^{-i (x-y)^2 / 2t} \, . |cellpadding= 6 |border |border colour = #0073CF |bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}</p>
<p>Thus, this is a formal way to express the <a href="fundamental_solution" title="wikilink">fundamental solution</a> or <strong><em>general solution</em></strong>. The interpretation of this expression is that the amplitude for a particle to be found at point <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> at time <span class="LaTeX">$t$</span> is the amplitude that it started at <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span>, times the amplitude that it went from <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span> to <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>, <em>summed over all the possible starting points</em>. In other words, it is a <a class="uri" href="convolution" title="wikilink">convolution</a> of the kernel <span class="LaTeX">$K$</span> with the arbitrary initial condition <span class="LaTeX">$ψ$</span><sub>0</sub>,</p>

<p>Since the amplitude to travel from <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> to <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span> after a time <span class="LaTeX">$t$</span>+<span class="LaTeX">$t$</span>' can be considered in two steps, the propagator obeys the composition identity,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_y K(x-y;t)K(y-z;t') = K(x-z;t+t')~ ,$$</span> which can be interpreted as follows: the amplitude to travel from <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> to <span class="LaTeX">$z$</span> in time <span class="LaTeX">$t$</span>+<span class="LaTeX">$t$</span>' is the sum of the amplitude to travel from <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> to <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span> in time <span class="LaTeX">$t$</span>, multiplied by the amplitude to travel from <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span> to <span class="LaTeX">$z$</span> in time <span class="LaTeX">$t$</span>', summed over <em>all possible intermediate states y</em>. This is a property of an arbitrary quantum system, and by subdividing the time into many segments, it allows the time evolution to be expressed as a <a href="path_integral_formulation" title="wikilink">path integral</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>The spreading of wave packets in quantum mechanics is directly related to the spreading of probability densities in <a class="uri" href="diffusion" title="wikilink">diffusion</a>.

<p><span class="LaTeX">$${\partial \over \partial t} \rho = {1\over 2} {\partial^2 \over \partial x^2 } \rho  ~,$$</span> where the factor of 2, which can be removed by a rescaling either time or space, is only for convenience.</p>
<p>A solution of this equation is the spreading Gaussian,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\rho_t(x) = {1\over \sqrt{2\pi t}} e^{-x^2 \over 2t} ~,$$</span> and, since the integral of ''ρ<sub>t</sub> is constant while the width is becoming narrow at small times, this function approaches a delta function at <em>t</em>=0,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\lim_{t\rightarrow 0} \rho_t(x) = \delta(x) \,$$</span> again only in the sense of distributions, so that</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\lim_{t\rightarrow 0} \int_x f(x) \rho_t(x) = f(0) \,$$</span> for any smooth <a href="test_function" title="wikilink">test function</a> <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span>.</p>
<p>The spreading Gaussian is the propagation kernel for the diffusion equation and it obeys the <a class="uri" href="convolution" title="wikilink">convolution</a> identity,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$K_{t+t'} = K_{t}*K_{t'} \, ,$$</span> which allows diffusion to be expressed as a path integral. The propagator is the exponential of an operator <span class="LaTeX">$H$</span>,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$K_t(x) = e^{-tH} \, ,$$</span> which is the infinitesimal diffusion operator,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$H= -{\nabla^2\over 2} \,  .$$</span></p>
<p>A matrix has two indices, which in continuous space makes it a function of <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>'. In this case, because of translation invariance, the matrix element <span class="LaTeX">$K$</span> only depend on the difference of the position, and a convenient abuse of notation is to refer to the operator, the matrix elements, and the function of the difference by the same name:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$K_t(x,x') = K_t(x-x') \,  .$$</span></p>
<p>Translation invariance means that continuous matrix multiplication,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$C(x,x'') = \int_{x'} A(x,x')B(x',x'') \,  ,$$</span> is essentially convolution,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$C(\Delta) = C(x-x'') = \int_{x'} A(x-x') B(x'-x'') = \int_{y} A(\Delta-y)B(y) \,  .$$</span></p>
<p>The exponential can be defined over a range of <em>t</em>s which include complex values, so long as integrals over the propagation kernel stay convergent,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$K_z(x) = e^{-zH} \, .$$</span> As long as the real part of <span class="LaTeX">$z$</span> is positive, for large values of <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$K$</span> is exponentially decreasing, and integrals over <span class="LaTeX">$K$</span> are indeed absolutely convergent.</p>
<p>The limit of this expression for <span class="LaTeX">$z$</span> approaching the pure imaginary axis is the above Schrödinger propagator encountered,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$K_t^{\rm Schr} = K_{it+\epsilon} = e^{-(it+\epsilon)H} \,  ,$$</span> which illustrates the above time evolution of Gaussians.</p>
<p>From the fundamental identity of exponentiation, or path integration,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$K_z * K_{z'} = K_{z+z'} \,$$</span> holds for all complex <em>z</em> values, where the integrals are absolutely convergent so that the operators are well defined.</p>
<p>Thus, quantum evolution of a Gaussian, which is the complex diffusion kernel <em>K</em>,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\psi_0(x) = K_a(x) = K_a * \delta(x) \,$$</span> amounts to the time-evolved state,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\psi_t = K_{it} * K_a = K_{a+it} \, .$$</span></p>
<p>This illustrates the above diffusive form of the complex Gaussian solutions,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\psi_t(x) = {1\over \sqrt{2\pi (a+it)} } e^{- {x^2\over 2(a+it)} } \,  .$$</span></p>
