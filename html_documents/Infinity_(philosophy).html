<h1>Infinity (philosophy)</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="philosophy" title="wikilink">philosophy</a>, <strong>infinity</strong> can be attributed to infinite dimensions, as for instance in <a href="Kant's_antinomies#The_First_Antinomy_(of_Space_and_Time)" title="wikilink">Kant's first antinomy</a>. In both theology and philosophy, infinity is explored in articles such as <a href="the_Ultimate_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">the Ultimate</a>, the <a href="Absolute_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">Absolute</a>, <a class="uri" href="God" title="wikilink">God</a>, and <a href="Zeno's_paradoxes" title="wikilink">Zeno's paradoxes</a>. In <a href="Greek_philosophy" title="wikilink">Greek philosophy</a>, for example in <a class="uri" href="Anaximander" title="wikilink">Anaximander</a>, 'the Boundless' is the origin of all that is. He took the beginning or first principle to be an endless, unlimited primordial mass (ἄπειρον, <em>apeiron</em>). In <a href="List_of_Christian_theologians" title="wikilink">Judeo-Christian theology</a>, for example in the work of theologians such as <a href="Duns_Scotus" title="wikilink">Duns Scotus</a>, the infinite nature of God invokes a sense of being without constraint, rather than a sense of being unlimited in quantity. In <a class="uri" href="ethics" title="wikilink">ethics</a> infinity plays an important role designating that which cannot be defined or reduced to knowledge or power.</p>

<p>Early thought belonging to <a class="uri" href="Buddhism" title="wikilink">Buddhism</a> recognised the existence of the infinite.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The <a href="Isha_Upanishad" title="wikilink">Isha Upanishad</a> of the <a class="uri" href="Yajurveda" title="wikilink">Yajurveda</a> (c. 4th to 3rd century BC) states that "if you remove a part from infinity [<em>pūrṇa</em>] or add a part to infinity, still what remains is infinity".</p>

<p>The <a href="Jainism" title="wikilink">Jain</a> mathematical text <em>Surya Prajnapti</em> (c. 400 BC) classifies all numbers into three sets: enumerable, innumerable, and infinite. Each of these was further subdivided into three orders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enumerable: lowest, intermediate and highest</li>
<li>Innumerable: nearly innumerable, truly innumerable and innumerably innumerable</li>
<li>Infinite: nearly infinite, truly infinite, infinitely infinite</li>
</ul>

<p>The Jains were the first to discard the idea that all infinites were the same or equal. They recognized different types of infinities: infinite in length (one <a class="uri" href="dimension" title="wikilink">dimension</a>), infinite in area (two dimensions), infinite in volume (three dimensions), and infinite perpetually (infinite number of dimensions).</p>

<p>According to Singh (1987), Joseph (2000) and Agrawal (2000), the highest enumerable number <em>N</em> of the Jains corresponds to the modern concept of <a href="Aleph_number" title="wikilink">aleph-null</a>

 (the <a href="cardinal_number" title="wikilink">cardinal number</a> of the infinite set of integers 1, 2, ...), the smallest cardinal <a href="transfinite_number" title="wikilink">transfinite number</a>. The Jains also defined a whole system of infinite cardinal numbers, of which the highest enumerable number <em>N</em> is the smallest.</p>

<p>In the Jaina work on the <a href="Set_theory" title="wikilink">theory of sets</a>, two basic types of infinite numbers are distinguished. On both physical and <a href="Ontology" title="wikilink">ontological</a> grounds, a distinction was made between  ("countless, innumerable") and <em>ananta</em> ("endless, unlimited"), between rigidly bounded and loosely bounded infinities.</p>
<h3 id="early-european-views-of-infinity">Early European views of infinity</h3>

<p>An early engagement with the idea of infinity was made by <a class="uri" href="Anaximander" title="wikilink">Anaximander</a> who considered infinity to be a foundational and primitive basis of reality.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In Book 3 of the work entitled <a href="Physics_(Aristotle)" title="wikilink">Physics</a>, written by <a class="uri" href="Aristotle" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a>, Aristotle deals with the concept in terms of his notion of <a class="uri" href="actuality" title="wikilink">actuality</a> and of <a class="uri" href="potentiality" title="wikilink">potentiality</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> </p>

<p>This is often called potential infinity; however there are two ideas mixed up with this. One is that it is always possible to find a number of things that surpasses any given number, even if there are not actually such things. The other is that we may quantify over infinite sets without restriction. For example,

, which reads, "for any <a class="uri" href="integer" title="wikilink">integer</a> n, there exists an integer m &gt; n such that P(m)". The second view is found in a clearer form by medieval writers such as <a href="William_of_Ockham" title="wikilink">William of Ockham</a>:</p>

<p><mtpl></mtpl></p>

<p>The parts are actually there, in some sense. However, on this view, no infinite magnitude can have a number, for whatever number we can imagine, there is always a larger one: "There are not so many (in number) that there are no more." <a href="Thomas_Aquinas" title="wikilink">Aquinas</a> also argued against the idea that infinity could be in any sense complete, or a totality.</p>

<p>Aristotle deals with infinity in the context of the <a href="prime_mover" title="wikilink">prime mover</a>, in Book 7 of the same work, the reasoning of which was later studied and commented on by <a class="uri" href="Simplicius" title="wikilink">Simplicius</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p><a class="uri" href="Plotinus" title="wikilink">Plotinus</a> considered infinity, while he was alive, during the 3rd century A.D.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="views-from-the-renaissance-to-modern-times">Views from the Renaissance to modern times</h3>
<h4 id="galileo">Galileo</h4>

<p><a href="Galileo_Galilei" title="wikilink">Galileo Galilei</a> acknowledged a fundamental truth in engaging with cognition on the concept of infinity, which is that problems arise only when people attempt to apply finite quantification onto the concept, which is, by definition having a finite quantification which amounts to immeasurably none.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Even so, Galileo was the first to notice that we can place an infinite set into <a href="one-to-one_correspondence" title="wikilink">one-to-one correspondence</a> with one of its <a href="proper_subset" title="wikilink">proper subsets</a> (any part of the set, that is not the whole). For example, we can match up the set of <a href="square_number" title="wikilink">square numbers</a> {1, 4, 9, 16, ...} with the <a href="natural_number" title="wikilink">natural numbers</a> {1, 2, 3, 4, ...} as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1 → 1<br/>
 2 → 4<br/>
 3 → 9<br/>
 4 → 16<br/>
 …
</dd>
</dl>

<p>It appeared, by this reasoning, as though a set which is naturally smaller than the set of which it is a part (since it does not contain all the members of that set) is in some sense the same "size". Galileo thought this was one of the difficulties which arise when we try, "with our finite minds," to comprehend the infinite.</p>

<p>The idea that size can be measured by one-to-one correspondence is today known as <a href="Hume's_principle" title="wikilink">Hume's principle</a>, although Hume, like Galileo, believed the principle could not be applied to infinite sets. (Mathematicians from the time of <a href="Georg_Cantor" title="wikilink">Georg Cantor</a> <em>do</em> apply the principle to infinite sets, and do have a notion of some infinite quantities being greater than others.)</p>
<h4 id="john-locke">John Locke</h4>

<p><a href="John_Locke" title="wikilink">Locke</a>, in common with most of the <a class="uri" href="empiricist" title="wikilink">empiricist</a> philosophers, also believed that we can have no proper idea of the infinite. They believed all our ideas were derived from <a href="sense_data" title="wikilink">sense data</a> or "impressions," and since all sensory impressions are inherently finite, so too are our thoughts and ideas. Our idea of infinity is merely negative or privative.</p>

<p>He considered that in considerations on the subject of eternity, which he classified as an infinity, humans are likely to make mistakes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="thomas-hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</h4>

<p>Famously, the ultra-empiricist <a href="Thomas_Hobbes" title="wikilink">Hobbes</a> tried to defend the idea of a potential infinity in light of the discovery, by <a href="Evangelista_Torricelli" title="wikilink">Evangelista Torricelli</a>, of a figure (<a href="Gabriel's_Horn" title="wikilink">Gabriel's Horn</a>) whose <a href="surface_area" title="wikilink">surface area</a> is infinite, but whose <a class="uri" href="volume" title="wikilink">volume</a> is finite. Not reported, this motivation of Hobbes came too late as <a href="curve" title="wikilink">curves</a> having infinite length yet bounding finite areas were known much before. Such seeming paradoxes are resolved by taking any finite figure and stretching its content infinitely in one direction; the magnitude of its content is unchanged as its divisions drop off geometrically but the magnitude of its bounds increases to infinity by necessity. Potentiality lies in the definitions of this operation, as <a class="uri" href="well-defined" title="wikilink">well-defined</a> and interconsistent mathematical axioms. A potential infinity is allowed by letting an infinitely-large quantity be cancelled out by an infinitely-small quantity.</p>
<h3 id="modern-philosophical-views">Modern philosophical views</h3>

<p>Modern discussion of the infinite is now regarded as part of set theory and mathematics. This discussion is generally avoided by philosophers. An exception was <a href="Ludwig_Wittgenstein" title="wikilink">Wittgenstein</a>, who made an impassioned attack upon <a href="axiomatic_set_theory" title="wikilink">axiomatic set theory</a>, and upon the idea of the actual infinite, during his "middle period".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> <mtpl></mtpl></p>

<p>Unlike the traditional empiricists, he thought that the infinite was in some way given to <a href="empirical_evidence" title="wikilink">sense experience</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ethics">Ethics</h3>

<p>The philosopher <a href="Emmanuel_Levinas" title="wikilink">Emmanuel Levinas</a> uses infinity to designate that which cannot be defined or reduced to knowledge or power. In Levinas' magnum opus <a href="Totality_and_Infinity" title="wikilink">Totality and Infinity</a> he says :</p>

<p><mtpl></mtpl></p>

<p>Levinas also wrote a work entitled <em>Philosophy and the Idea of Infinity</em>, which was published during 1957.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="three-types-of-infinities">Three types of infinities</h2>

<p>Besides the mathematical infinity and the physical infinity, there could also be a philosophical infinity. There are scientists who hold that all three <a href="Philosophical_realism" title="wikilink">really</a> exist and there are scientists who hold that none of the three exists. And in between there are the various possibilities. <a href="Rudy_Rucker" title="wikilink">Rudy Rucker</a>, in his book <em>Infinity and the Mind—the Science and Philosophy of the Infinite</em> (1982), has worked out a model list of representatives of each of the eight possible standpoints. The footnote on p. 335 of his book suggests the consideration of the following names: <a href="Abraham_Robinson" title="wikilink">Abraham Robinson</a>, <a class="uri" href="Plato" title="wikilink">Plato</a>, <a href="Thomas_Aquinas" title="wikilink">Thomas Aquinas</a>, <a href="L.E.J._Brouwer" title="wikilink">L.E.J.
