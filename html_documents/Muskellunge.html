<p>The <strong>muskellunge</strong> <em>(Esox masquinongy)</em>, also known as <strong>muskelunge</strong>, <strong>muscallonge</strong>, <strong>milliganong</strong>, or <strong>maskinonge</strong> (and often abbreviated "<strong>muskie</strong>" or "<strong>musky</strong>"), is a <a class="uri" href="species" title="wikilink">species</a> of large, relatively uncommon <a href="Fresh_water" title="wikilink">freshwater</a> <a class="uri" href="fish" title="wikilink">fish</a> native to <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a>. The muskellunge is the largest member of the pike <a href="family_(biology)" title="wikilink">family</a>, <a class="uri" href="Esocidae" title="wikilink">Esocidae</a>. The common name comes from the <a href="Ojibwa_language" title="wikilink">Ojibwa</a> word <em>maashkinoozhe</em>, meaning "ugly pike", by way of <a href="French_language" title="wikilink">French</a> <em>masque allongé</em> (modified from the Ojibwa word by <a href="folk_etymology" title="wikilink">folk etymology</a>), "elongated face." The French common name is <em>masquinongé</em> or <em>maskinongé</em>.</p>

<p>The muskellunge is known by a wide variety of <a href="common_name" title="wikilink">trivial names</a> including <a class="uri" href="Ohio" title="wikilink">Ohio</a> muskellunge, <a href="Great_Lakes" title="wikilink">Great Lakes</a> muskellunge, barred muskellunge, <a href="Ohio_River" title="wikilink">Ohio River</a> pike, <a href="Allegheny_River" title="wikilink">Allegheny River</a> pike, jack pike, unspotted muskellunge and the <a class="uri" href="Wisconsin" title="wikilink">Wisconsin</a> muskellunge.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>Muskellunge closely resemble other esocids such as the <a href="northern_pike" title="wikilink">northern pike</a> and <a href="American_pickerel" title="wikilink">American pickerel</a> in both appearance and behavior. Like the northern pike and other aggressive pikes, the body plan is typical of <a href="ambush_predator" title="wikilink">ambush predators</a> with an elongated body, flat head, and dorsal, pelvic and anal <a href="Fish_anatomy#Fins" title="wikilink">fins</a> set far back on the body. Muskellunge are typically  long and weigh ,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> though some have reached up to  and almost .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> A fish reported at 88 in (224 cm) and 110 lb (50 kg) reportedly caught around 1908 has been identified as a hoax or legend. A fish with a weight of 61.25 lb (27.8 kg) was caught in November 2000 in Georgian Bay, Ontario. The fish are a light silver, brown, or green, with dark vertical stripes on the flank, which may tend to break up into spots. In some cases, markings may be absent altogether, especially in fish from <a href="Turbidity" title="wikilink">turbid</a> waters. This is in contrast to northern pike, which have dark bodies with light markings. A reliable method to distinguish the two similar species is by counting the <a href="Canal_pore" title="wikilink">sensory pores</a> on the underside of the <a class="uri" href="mandible" title="wikilink">mandible</a>. A muskie will have seven or more per side, while the northern pike never has more than six. The lobes of the caudal (tail) fin in muskellunge come to a sharper point, while those of northern pike are more generally rounded. In addition, unlike pike, muskies have no scales on the lower half of their <a href="operculum_(fish)" title="wikilink">opercula</a>.</p>
<h2 id="habitat">Habitat</h2>

<p>Muskellunge are found in <a href="Oligotrophic_lake" title="wikilink">oligotrophic</a> and <a href="mesotrophic_lake" title="wikilink">mesotrophic lakes</a> and large <a href="river" title="wikilink">rivers</a> from northern <a class="uri" href="Michigan" title="wikilink">Michigan</a>, northern <a class="uri" href="Wisconsin" title="wikilink">Wisconsin</a>, and northern <a class="uri" href="Minnesota" title="wikilink">Minnesota</a> through the Great Lakes region, north into <a class="uri" href="Canada" title="wikilink">Canada</a>, throughout most of the <a href="Saint_Lawrence_River" title="wikilink">St Lawrence River</a> drainage, and northward throughout the upper <a href="Mississippi_River" title="wikilink">Mississippi</a> valley, although the species also extends as far south as <a href="Chattanooga,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Chattanooga</a> in the <a href="Tennessee_River" title="wikilink">Tennessee River</a> valley. Also, a small population is found in the <a href="Broad_River_(South_Carolina)" title="wikilink">Broad River</a> in <a href="South_Carolina" title="wikilink">South Carolina</a>. Several North Georgia reservoirs also have healthy stocked populations of muskie. They are also found in the <a href="Red_River_of_the_North" title="wikilink">Red River</a> drainage of the <a href="Hudson_Bay" title="wikilink">Hudson Bay</a> basin. Muskie were introduced to western <a href="Saint_John_River_(Bay_of_Fundy)" title="wikilink">Saint John River</a> in the late 1960s and have now spread to many connecting waterways in northern <a class="uri" href="Maine" title="wikilink">Maine</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>They prefer clear waters where they lurk along weed edges, rock outcrops, or other structures to rest. A fish forms two distinct home ranges in summer: a shallow range and a deeper one. The shallow range is generally much smaller than the deeper range due to shallow water heating up. A muskie continually patrols the ranges in search of available food in the appropriate conditions of water temperature.</p>
<h2 id="diet">Diet</h2>

<p>Most of their diets consist of fish, but can also include <a class="uri" href="crayfish" title="wikilink">crayfish</a>, <a href="frog" title="wikilink">frogs</a>, <a href="duck" title="wikilink">ducklings</a>, <a href="snake" title="wikilink">snakes</a>, <a href="muskrat" title="wikilink">muskrats</a>, <a href="mouse" title="wikilink">mice</a>, other small <a href="mammal" title="wikilink">mammals</a>, and small birds. The mouth is large with many long, needle-like teeth. Muskies will attempt to take their prey head-first, sometimes in a single gulp. They will take prey items up to 30% of their total length. In the spring, they tend to prefer smaller bait since their metabolism is slower, while large bait are preferred in fall as preparation for winter.</p>
<h2 id="length-and-weight">Length and weight</h2>

<p> As muskellunge grow longer they increase in weight, but the relationship between length and weight is not linear. The relationship between them can be expressed by a <a href="Power_law" title="wikilink">power-law equation</a>:</p>

</p>

<p>The exponent b is close to 3.0 for all species, and c is a constant for each species. For muskellunge, b = 3.325, higher than for many common species, and c = 0.000089 pounds/inch.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>This equation implies that a 30-in (76-cm) muskellunge will weigh about 8 lb (3.6 kg), while a 40-in muskellunge will weigh about 18 lb.</p>
<h2 id="behavior">Behavior</h2>

<p> Muskellunge are sometimes <a class="uri" href="gregarious" title="wikilink">gregarious</a>, forming small schools in distinct territories. They spawn in mid to late spring, somewhat later than northern pike, over shallow, vegetated areas. A rock or sand bottom is preferred for spawning so the eggs do not sink into the mud and suffocate. The males arrive first and attempt to establish dominance over a territory. Spawning may last from five to 10 days and occurs mainly at night. The eggs are negatively buoyant and slightly adhesive; they adhere to plants and the bottom of the lake. Soon afterward, they are abandoned by the adults. Those <a href="embryo" title="wikilink">embryos</a> which are not eaten by fish, insects, or crayfish hatch within two weeks. The larvae live on <a href="Egg_(biology)#Fish_eggs" title="wikilink">yolk</a> until the mouth is fully developed, when they begin to feed on <a href="copepod" title="wikilink">copepods</a> and other <a class="uri" href="zooplankton" title="wikilink">zooplankton</a>. They soon begin to prey upon fish. Juveniles generally attain a length of  by November of their first year.</p>
<h2 id="predators">Predators</h2>

<p>Adult muskellunge are <a href="apex_predator" title="wikilink">apex predators</a> where they occur naturally. Only humans pose a threat to an adult but juveniles are consumed by other muskies, northern pike, <a href="Black_bass" title="wikilink">bass</a>, and occasionally birds of prey. The musky's low reproductive rate and slow growth render populations highly vulnerable to <a class="uri" href="overfishing" title="wikilink">overfishing</a>. This has prompted some jurisdictions to institute <a href="Hatchery#Fish_hatcheries" title="wikilink">artificial propagation</a> programs in an attempt to maintain otherwise unsustainably high rates of angling effort and <a href="habitat_destruction" title="wikilink">habitat destruction</a>.</p>
<h2 id="angling">Angling</h2>

<p><a href="Angling" title="wikilink">Anglers</a> seek large muskies as trophies or for sport. The fish attain impressive swimming speeds, but are not particularly maneuverable. The highest-speed runs are usually fairly short, but they can be quite intense. The muskie can also do headshaking in an attempt to rid itself of a hook. Muskies are known for their strength and for their tendency to leap from the water in stunning acrobatic displays. A challenging fish to catch, the muskie has been called "the fish of ten thousand casts". Anglers tend to use smaller lures in spring or during cold-front conditions and larger lures in fall or the heat of summer. The average lure is  long, but longer lures of  are not uncommon. Many times, live bait is used in the form of "muskie minnows" or 8- to 12-in-long fish strung on treble hooks. Anglers in many areas are strongly encouraged to practice <a href="catch_and_release" title="wikilink">catch and release</a> when fishing for muskellunge due to their low population. In places where muskie are not native, such as in Maine, anglers are encouraged not to release the fish back into the water because of their negative impact on the populations of trout and other smaller fish species.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> One strategy for securing the fish is called the <a href="Figure_Eight_(musky)" title="wikilink">figure eight</a>.</p>

<h2 id="subspecies-and-hybrids">Subspecies and hybrids</h2>

<p>Though interbreeding with other pike species can complicate the classification of some individuals, <a href="Zoology" title="wikilink">zoologists</a> usually recognize up to three <a class="uri" href="subspecies" title="wikilink">subspecies</a> of muskellunge.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The Great Lakes Muskellunge or Spotted Muskellunge (<em>E. m. masquinongy</em>) is the most common variety in the Great Lakes basin and surrounding area. The spots on the body form oblique rows.</li>
<li>The Chautauqua Muskellunge or Barred Muskellunge (<em>E. m. ohioensis</em>) is known from the Ohio River system, <a href="Chautauqua_Lake" title="wikilink">Chautauqua Lake</a>, <a href="Lake_Ontario" title="wikilink">Lake Ontario</a>, and the St Lawrence River.</li>
<li>The Clear Muskellunge (<em>E. m. immaculatus</em>) is most common in the inland lakes of Wisconsin, Minnesota, northwestern Ontario, and southeastern <a class="uri" href="Manitoba" title="wikilink">Manitoba</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="tiger_muskellunge" title="wikilink">tiger muskellunge</a> (<em>E. masquinongy</em> × <em>lucius</em> or <em>E. lucius</em> × <em>masquinongy</em>) is a <a href="Hybrid_(biology)" title="wikilink">hybrid</a> of the muskie and northern pike. Hybrids are sterile, although females sometimes unsuccessfully engage in spawning motions. Some hybrids are artificially produced and planted for anglers to catch. Tiger muskies grow faster than pure muskies, but do not attain the ultimate size of their pure relatives, as the tiger muskie does not live as long. The body is often quite silvery and largely or entirely without spots, but with indistinct longitudinal bands.</p>
