<p>The <strong>Rylands Library Papyrus P52</strong>, also known as the <strong>St. John's fragment</strong> and with an accession reference of <strong>Papyrus Rylands Greek 457</strong>, is a fragment from a <a class="uri" href="papyrus" title="wikilink">papyrus</a> <a class="uri" href="codex" title="wikilink">codex</a>, measuring only 3.5 by 2.5 inches (8.9 by 6 cm) at its widest; and conserved with the <a href="Rylands_Papyri" title="wikilink">Rylands Papyri</a> at the <a href="John_Rylands_University_Library" title="wikilink">John Rylands University Library</a> <a class="uri" href="Manchester" title="wikilink">Manchester</a>, <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">UK</a>. The front (recto) contains parts of seven lines from the <a href="Gospel_of_John" title="wikilink">Gospel of John</a> 18:31–33, in <a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek</a>, and the back (verso) contains parts of seven lines from verses 37–38.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Since 2007, the papyrus has been on permanent display in the <a href="John_Rylands_Library" title="wikilink">library's</a> Deansgate building.</p>

The style of the script is <a href="Hadrian" title="wikilink">Hadrianic</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> which would suggest a most probable date somewhere between 117 CE and 138 CE. But the difficulty of fixing the date of a fragment based solely on <a href="paleography" title="wikilink">paleographic</a> evidence allows a much wider range such that "any serious consideration of the window of possible dates for P52 must include dates in the later second and early third centuries."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>The fragment of papyrus was among a group acquired on the Egyptian market in 1920 by <a href="Bernard_Grenfell" title="wikilink">Bernard Grenfell</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The original transcription and translation of the fragment of text was not done until 1934, by <a href="Colin_H._Roberts" title="wikilink">Colin H.

<p>  The papyrus is written on both sides and hence must be from a <a class="uri" href="codex" title="wikilink">codex</a>, a sewn and folded <a class="uri" href="book" title="wikilink">book</a>, not a <a class="uri" href="scroll" title="wikilink">scroll</a>, roll or isolated sheet; and the surviving portion also includes part of the top and inner margins of the page. The recto consequently preserves the top left corner of a right-hand page; while the verso preserves the top right corner of a left-hand page.

<p>There appears insufficient room for the repeated phrase (ΕΙΣ ΤΟΥΤΟ) in the second line of the verso, and it is suggested that these words were inadvertently dropped through <a class="uri" href="haplography" title="wikilink">haplography</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>The writing is generously scaled – letter forms vary between 0.3 and 0.4 cm in height, lines are spaced approximately 0.5 cm apart, and there is a margin of 2 cm at the top.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> C.

Roberts describes the handwriting as "heavy, rounded and rather elaborate",<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> but nevertheless not the work of "a practised scribe" (i.e. not a professional bookhand).

<p>In total, 114 legible letters are visible on the two sides of the fragment, representing 18 out of the 24 letters of the <a href="Greek_Alphabet" title="wikilink">Greek Alphabet</a>;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> beta, zeta, xi, phi, chi, and psi being missing. Roberts noted that the writing is painstaking and rather laboured, with instances of individual letters formed using several strokes "with a rather clumsy effect" (e.g. the sigma <strong>Σ</strong> at line three of the recto, and the eta <strong>H</strong> immediately following it).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Several letters are inclined to stray away from the notional upper and lower writing lines.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Another peculiarity is that there are two distinct forms of the letter alpha <strong>Α</strong>;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> most are formed from a separate loop and diagonal stroke, where the top of the stroke has a distinctive decorative arch while the bottom is hooked; but on the fourth line of the verso there is a smaller alpha formed by a single spiralling loop with no arch or hooks. Also present in two forms is the letter upsilon <strong>Υ</strong>; the more common form is constructed from two strokes, each stroke terminating in a decorative hook or finial (see the second line of the recto); but on the fourth line of the verso is an upsilon formed from a single looped stroke with no decoration.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> These observations support Roberts's supposition that the scribe was an educated person writing carefully in imitation of a calligraphic hand, rather than a professional scribe writing to order; such that, on occasion, the writer inadvertently reverted to the undecorated (and often smaller) letter forms of his everyday hand.</p>

<p>Roberts noted that in addition to alpha and upsilon, other letters also tend to be given decorative hooks, especially iota <strong>Ι</strong> and omega <strong>Ω</strong> (both seen in the seventh line of the recto).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> He also drew attention to the forms of epsilon <strong>Ε</strong> (with an extended cross-stroke a little above the centre-line, as in the fourth line of the verso), delta <strong>Δ</strong> (with a decorative arch, as in the first and second lines of the recto) and mu <strong>Μ</strong> (with a central stroke dipping down to the baseline, as in the third line of the recto).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Nongbri confirms Roberts observations, and also notes distinctive forms of rho <strong>Ρ</strong> (with a small head and an undecorated downstroke extending well below the lower line, as in the second line of the verso),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> pi <strong>Π</strong> (with an extended horizontal stroke, as in the third line of the recto)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> and kappa <strong>Κ</strong> (formed like the looped upsilon with an additional downwards stroke, as in the fourth line of the recto).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Aside from their sometimes clumsy construction, the sigma and eta are also distinctive in form; the sigma facing fully to the right, and the eta having a distinctive high cross stroke.</p>

<p>In 1977, Roberts surveyed fourteen papyri believed to be of Christian origin, twelve codices and two scrolls; comprising all the Christian manuscripts then commonly assessed as likely having a second century date including

First, the papyrus has been dated based on the handwriting alone, without the support of dated textual references or associated archeology.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Secondly, like all other surviving early Gospel manuscripts, this fragment is from a <a class="uri" href="codex" title="wikilink">codex</a>, not a scroll.

Otherwise, however, Barker rejects from this graphic stream all the other comparators proposed by Roberts and his correspondents, including P. Flor 1. 1 (153 CE).
