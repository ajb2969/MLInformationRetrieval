<h1>The Number of the Beast (novel)</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong><em>The Number of the Beast</em></strong> is a <a href="science_fiction_novel" title="wikilink">science fiction novel</a> by <a href="Robert_A._Heinlein" title="wikilink">Robert A. Heinlein</a> published in 1980. The first (paperback) edition featured a cover and interior illustrations by <a href="Richard_M._Powers" title="wikilink">Richard M. Powers</a>. Excerpts from the novel were serialized in the magazine <em><a href="Omni_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Omni</a></em> (1979 October, November).</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>

<p>The book is a series of diary entries by each of the four main characters: Zebadiah John Carter, programmer Dejah Thoris "Deety" Burroughs Carter, her mathematics professor father Jacob Burroughs, and an off-campus socialite Hilda Corners. The names "Dejah Thoris", "Burroughs", and "Carter" are overt references to <a href="John_Carter_of_Mars" title="wikilink">John Carter</a> and <a href="Dejah_Thoris" title="wikilink">Dejah Thoris</a>, the protagonists of the <a class="uri" href="Barsoom" title="wikilink">Barsoom</a> novels of <a href="Edgar_Rice_Burroughs" title="wikilink">Edgar Rice Burroughs</a>.</p>

<p>The four travel in Zebadiah's modified air car <em>Gay Deceiver</em>, which is equipped with the professor's "continua" device and armed by the Australian Defence Force. The continua device was built by Professor Burroughs while he was formulating his theories on n-dimensional <a href="non-euclidean_geometry" title="wikilink">non-euclidean geometry</a>. The geometry of the novel's universe contains six dimensions; the three spatial dimensions known to the real world, and three time dimensions - <em>t</em>, the real world's temporal dimension, <em>τ</em> (tau), and <em>т</em> (teh). The continua device can travel on all six axes. The continua device allows travel into various <a href="fictional_universe" title="wikilink">fictional universes</a>, such as the <a href="Land_of_Oz" title="wikilink">Land of Oz</a>, as well as through time. An attempt to visit Barsoom takes them to an apparently different version of Mars seemingly under the colonial rule of the <a href="British_Empire" title="wikilink">British</a> and <a href="Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">Russian</a> empires; but near the end of the novel, Heinlein's recurring character <a href="Lazarus_Long" title="wikilink">Lazarus Long</a> hints that they had traveled to Barsoom, and that its "colonial" status was an illusion imposed on them by the <a href="telepathy" title="wikilink">telepathically</a> adept Barsoomians:</p>

 or 10,314,424,798,490,535,546,171,949,056, the initial number of <a href="Parallel_universe_(fiction)" title="wikilink">parallel universes</a> accessible through the continua device. It is later theorized by the character Jacob that the number may be merely the instantly accessible universes from a given location, and that there is a larger structure that implies an infinite number of universes.</p>
<h2 id="writing-style">Writing style</h2>

<p>The novel lies somewhere between <a class="uri" href="parody" title="wikilink">parody</a> and <a href="Homage_(arts)" title="wikilink">homage</a> in its deliberate use of the style of the 1930s' <a href="pulp_magazine" title="wikilink">pulp novels</a>. Many of the plot lines and characters are derived directly from the pulps, as referenced by the first line of the novel:</p>

<p><em>The Number of the Beast</em> contains many <a href="in-joke" title="wikilink">in-jokes</a> and references to the author. The name of every villain is an <a class="uri" href="anagram" title="wikilink">anagram</a> of a name or <a href="pen_name" title="wikilink">pen name</a> of Robert or <a href="Virginia_Heinlein" title="wikilink">Virginia Heinlein</a>.</p>

<p>As in many of his later works, Heinlein refers to the idea of <a class="uri" href="solipsism" title="wikilink">solipsism</a>, but in this book develops it into an idea he called "<a href="World_as_Myth" title="wikilink">World as Myth</a>" — the idea that universes are created by the act of <a href="imagination" title="wikilink">imagining</a> them, so that all fictional worlds are in fact real and all real worlds are figments of fictional figures' fancy, which is why Heinlein uses the <a class="uri" href="Ouroboros" title="wikilink">Ouroboros</a> symbology in later works like <em><a href="The_Cat_Who_Walks_Through_Walls" title="wikilink">The Cat Who Walks Through Walls</a></em>. This also plays into the ideology of "Thou Art God" from Heinlein's earlier work <em><a href="Stranger_In_A_Strange_Land" title="wikilink">Stranger In A Strange Land</a></em>.</p>
<h2 id="literary-significance-and-reception">Literary significance and reception</h2>

<p>Jack Kirwan wrote in the <em><a href="National_Review" title="wikilink">National Review</a></em> that the novel is "about two men and two women in a time machine safari through this and other universes. But describing <em>The Number of the Beast</em> thus is like saying <em>Moby Dick</em> is about a one-legged guy trying to catch a fish". He goes on to say that Heinlein celebrates the "competent person".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Sue K. Hurwitz said in her review for the <em><a href="School_Library_Journal" title="wikilink">School Library Journal</a></em> that it is "a catalog of Heinlein's sins as an author; it is sophomoric, sexist, militantly right wing, and excessively verbose", and comments that the book's ending was "a devastating parody of SF conventions—will have genre addicts rolling on the floor. It's garbage, but right from the top of the heap".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Heinlein buff David Potter explained on alt.fan.heinlein in a posting reprinted on the <a href="http://heinleinsociety.org/rah/numberbeast.html">Heinlein Society</a> that the entire book is actually "one of the greatest textbooks on narrative fiction ever produced, with a truly magnificent set of examples of HOW NOT TO DO IT right there in the foreground, and constant explanations of how to do it right, with literary references to people and books that DID do it right, in the background." He noted that "every single time there's a boring lecture or tedious character interaction going on in the foreground, there's an example of how to do it RIGHT in the background."</p>
