<h1>TI-36</h1>
<hr/>

<p><a href="Texas_Instruments" title="wikilink">Texas Instruments</a> <strong>TI-36</strong> is a series of <a href="scientific_calculator" title="wikilink">scientific calculators</a> distributed by <a href="Texas_Instruments" title="wikilink">Texas Instruments</a>. It currently represents the high end model for the TI-30 product lines.</p>

<p>The TI-36 model designation began in 1986 as variant of <a class="uri" href="TI-35" title="wikilink">TI-35</a> PLUS with solar cells.</p>
<h2 id="ti-35-plusti-36-solar-1986">TI-35 Plus/TI-36 Solar (1986)</h2>

<p>  It can display 10 digits mantissa with 2 digits exponent, and calculates with 12-digit precision internally.</p>

<p>TI-36 SOLAR was based on 1985 version of TI-35 PLUS, but incorporates solar cells.</p>

<p>It addition to standard features such as trigonometric functions, exponents, logarithms, and intelligent <a href="order_of_operations" title="wikilink">order of operations</a> found in TI-30 and TI-34 series of calculators, it also include base (decimal, hexadecimal, octal, binary) calculations, complex values, statistics. Conversions include polar-rectangular coordinates (P←→R), angles.</p>

<p>Other features include x-y exchange, percentage, register-current stack exchange, factorial, permutation/combination.</p>

<p>Maximum open parenthesis level is 15, with 6 pending operation stacks.</p>

<p>There are 2 operand registers (a, b) and 1 memory register.</p>

<p>TI-35 PLUS uses Toshiba T7767 processor, while TI-36 SOLAR uses Toshiba T7768 processor.</p>

<p>It was manufactured by Taiwanese company <a href="Inventec" title="wikilink">Inventec Corporation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="section">1989</h3>

<p>TI-35 PLUS now uses Toshiba T7767S. Cosmetic changes include black shell.</p>

<p>TI-36 SOLAR features smaller, more efficient solar cells, and cosmetic changes. The text "ANYLITE SOLAR" replaces "SCIENTIFIC" on the bottom right of the face.</p>

<p>The design was similar on the 1991 version of <a class="uri" href="TI-68" title="wikilink">TI-68</a>, but without programming features and tilt screen, and only uses 7-segment LCD display. The double shift keys are remained.</p>

<p>Base calculations were updated to include logic operations (NOT, AND, OR, XOR, XNOR). Additional unit conversions include cm-in, litre-US galleon, kg-lb, Celsius-Fahrenheit, gram-ounce. There are 8 physical constants. Register count was increased to 3. New statistic modes include 2-variable statistics with linear regression.</p>

<p>Other new features include cubic root, fraction mode display and conversion (pure/mixed). Complex function was removed.</p>

<p>Stack levels are 15 open parentheses.</p>

<p>TI-35X uses Toshiba T6A58S, while TI-36X SOLAR uses Toshiba T6A57 processor.</p>
<h3 id="section-1">1993</h3>

<p>It received cosmetic redesigns, which include rubber-like keys and rounder case.</p>
<h3 id="ti-36x-solar-1996">TI-36X Solar (1996)</h3>

<p>It received cosmetic redesigns, which include recolored keys and labels, rounder case, solid plastic button. The bare processor is now attached directly on motherboard. TI-35 was since then discontinued.</p>
<h3 id="ti-36-eco-rs-1999">TI-36 eco RS (1999)</h3>

<p>The design is based on 1996 version of TI-36X Solar, but was marketed to use recycled plastics for housing.</p>
<h3 id="ti-36x-solar-2004">TI-36X SOLAR (2004)</h3>

<p>It was a cosmetic redesign for 1996 model, with design theme found in 2004 BA II PLUS Professional financial calculator and 2003 TI-1706SV arithmetic calculator.</p>
<h2 id="ti-36x-ii-1999-2-line-displays">TI-36X II (1999) (2-Line Displays)</h2>

<p>A prominent new feature is 2-line display, which includes a row of 11-character, 5x7-cell characters, used to display expressions entered by user. To complement the 2-line display, it also stores multiple expressions. The interface was streamlined to use shift menus to access most scientific functions. An expression can have up to 88 characters or items.</p>

<p>Internal precision was increased to 13 digits, while registers were increased to 5 for memory and 2 for expressions (up to 47 characters or items).</p>

<p>New arithmetic features include integer division.</p>

<p>New unit conversions (meter-foot, meter-yard, kilometer-mile, liter-UK galleon, kilometer per hour-meter per second), and 8 more physical constants were added (total 16 constants, 10 conversion pairs). Pi constant was also added.</p>

<p>New 2-variable statistic regression models include natural logarithm, exponent, power. Up to 42 sample points or pairs can be stored.</p>

<p>In base calculation, binary base was removed.</p>

<p>Complex function was restored. Supported functions include conjugate, real/imaginary component, absolute value.</p>

<p>Other new functions include integral calculation (<a href="Simpson's_Rule" title="wikilink">Simpson's Rule</a>, max 99 intervals), random number generators (0-1 real, integer).</p>

<p>Stacks were increased to 23 pending operations, 8 pending values.</p>

<p>Cosmetic changes include a <a class="uri" href="D-pad" title="wikilink">D-pad</a> and a restyled case.</p>
<h3 id="section-2">2004</h3>

<p>It was a cosmetic redesign of the 1999 model. Changes include new coloured keys and screen frame.</p>

<p>It was manufactured by <a href="Nam_Tai_Electronics" title="wikilink">Nam Tai Electronics</a>.</p>
<h2 id="ti-36x-pro-2011-multi-line-displays">TI-36X Pro (2011) (Multi-Line Displays)</h2>

<p>2011 brought a significant overhaul to the TI-36 series called the <a href="http://www.datamath.org/Sci/Modern/TI-36X-PRO.htm">TI-36X Pro</a>. This model incorporates the multi-line dot matrix display already used in the TI-30 and 34 MultiView series calculators. This display allows the calculator to perform numeric derivatives and integrals in a way similar to the much more advanced TI-83 series graphing calculators.</p>

<p>Maximum expression length is reduced to 80 characters.</p>

<p>Registers were increased to 8 for memory, 1 for formula (44 characters), and can store up to 3 list formulas (up to 42 characters or items).</p>

<p>Physical constants are increased by 4 to 20, conversion sets are increased to 40 (20 pairs).</p>

<p>Binary mode is restored for Base calculation.</p>

<p>The TI-36X Pro is an updated version of the European model, the <a href="http://www.datamath.org/Sci/Modern/TI-30X-PRO.htm">TI-30X Pro MultiView</a>, which was taken off the market shortly after its release in 2010 for programming errors.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> While the 30X's bugs were fixed for the relaunch as the 36X, as at January 2012 the updated version contained a notable software bug of its own, where it displayed <a href="Fraction_(mathematics)#Mixed_numbers" title="wikilink">mixed numbers</a> involving
