<h1>Draft:Hierarchical testing of variables in high-dimensional datasets</h1>
<hr/>
<hr/>
<p>In statistics, <strong>hierarchical testing of variables in high-dimensional datasets</strong>, where the number of parameters is much greater than the number of observations (<em>p</em> ≫ <em>n</em>), can be used in calculating the <a href="p-value" title="wikilink"> p-values</a> for the significance of parameter clusters in predicting a response variable. The procedure outlined below calculates the p-values for testing the group of <a href="null_hypothesis" title="wikilink"> null hypotheses</a> <span class="LaTeX">$H_{0,C}$</span>, where <span class="LaTeX">$C$</span> is a cluster of highly correlated parameters in the hierarchical structure <span class="LaTeX">$\tau$</span>. The p-value calculation procedure contains four parts: <a href="hierarchical_clustering" title="wikilink">hierarchical clustering</a>, screening variables, testing and multiplicity adjustment, and aggregation and hierarchical adjustment.</p>
<h3 id="clustering">Clustering</h3>
<p>First, the parameters are grouped in hierarchical clusters using correlation between variables as the distance metric. Other clustering methods and <a class="uri" href="distance" title="wikilink">distance</a> measurements may be used as desired.</p>
<h3 id="variable-screening">Variable screening</h3>
<p>Next, a limited set of predictors are selected from the data. The data are randomly divided into two groups with equal sample size, with data from the first group, <span class="LaTeX">$N_\text{in}^{(b)}$</span>, used for parameter selection with <a href="Least_squares#Lasso_method" title="wikilink"> lasso</a> or other parameter selection procedure of choice. If the data have an odd number of observations, the group with fewer observations is used for variable selection. The data splitting occurs <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span> times, leading to selected variable sets <span class="LaTeX">$\hat{S}^{(1)},\ldots, \hat{S}^{(B)}$</span>.</p>
<h3 id="testing-and-multiplicity-adjustment">Testing and multiplicity adjustment</h3>
<p>After screening variables, the second half of the data split, <span class="LaTeX">$N_\text{out}^{(b)}$</span>, is used in generating p-values for the clusters as follows. If a given cluster <span class="LaTeX">$C$</span> contains at least one variable in the selected group <span class="LaTeX">$\hat{S}^{(b)}$</span>, then the second half of the data split is utilized for a partial F test, using the <a href="least_squares" title="wikilink"> linear model</a> generated with the selected set as the full model and the model with the intersection of the selected set and the cluster as the tested model.</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$p^{C,(b)} = \begin{cases}
   \displaystyle p_\text{partial F-test}^{C\ \cap\ S^{(b)}}  \text{ based on } \mathbf{Y}_{N_\text{out}^{(b)}}, \mathbf{X}_{N_\text{out}^{(b)}, \hat{S}^{(b)}}, & \text{if } C \cap \hat{S}^{(b)} \ne{} 0\\
       \displaystyle 1, & \text{if } C \cap \hat{S}^{(b)} = 0
    \end{cases}$$</span></p>
<p>The p-values are then multiplied by a ratio of the cardinality of the selected set to the cardinality of the intersection of the selected set and the cluster – as the result can sometimes be greater than one, the minimum of the adjusted p-value and 1 is taken.</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$p_\textrm{adj}^{C,(b)} = \min \left(1,  p^{C,{(b)}} \frac{|\hat{S}^{(b)}|} {|C \cap \hat{S}^{(b)}|} \right)$$</span></p>
<h3 id="aggregation-and-hierarchical-adjustment">Aggregation and hierarchical adjustment</h3>
<p>To aggregate p-values for <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span> clusters, <span class="LaTeX">$\gamma$</span> quantiles are taken across <span class="LaTeX">$1,\ldots, B \ p_\textrm{adj} ^ {C,(b)} / \gamma$</span> for each cluster. The aggregated p-value is again upper bounded by 1 (the minimum of the quantiles and 1 is taken). In practice, <span class="LaTeX">$\gamma$</span> values may be taken from 0.05 to 1 in 0.025 size steps.</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$Q^c(\gamma) = \min \left( 1, q_\gamma(p_\textrm{adj}^{C,(b)} / \gamma;
b=1,\ldots,B) \right)$$</span></p>
<p>To eliminate <span class="LaTeX">$\gamma$</span>, the infimum of the aggregated p-values is taken for <span class="LaTeX">$\gamma  \in ( \gamma_{\textrm{min}}, 1)$</span> and adjusted by <span class="LaTeX">$(1-\log(\gamma_{\textrm{min}}))$</span>, and the minimum of the resulting value and 1 is taken.</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$P^C = \min \left( 1, (1-\log(\gamma_\min)) \inf_{\gamma \in (\gamma_\min, 1)} Q^C(\gamma) \right)$$</span></p>
<p>Finally, the p-values are hierarchically adjusted such that the p-value of a cluster is always greater than the p-value of its ancestor cluster, resulting in increasing p-values with each smaller cluster in the tree.</p>
