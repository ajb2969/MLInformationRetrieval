<h1>Dimension of an algebraic variety</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a> and specifically in <a href="algebraic_geometry" title="wikilink">algebraic geometry</a>, the <strong>dimension</strong> of an <a href="algebraic_variety" title="wikilink">algebraic variety</a> may be defined in various equivalent ways.</p>
<p>Some of these definitions are of geometric nature, while some other are purely algebraic and rely on <a href="commutative_algebra" title="wikilink">commutative algebra</a>. Some are restricted to algebraic varieties while others apply also to any <a href="algebraic_set" title="wikilink">algebraic set</a>. Some are intrinsic, as independent of any embedding of the variety into an <a href="affine_space" title="wikilink">affine</a> or <a href="projective_space" title="wikilink">projective space</a>, while other are related to such an embedding.</p>
<h2 id="dimension-of-an-affine-algebraic-set">Dimension of an affine algebraic set</h2>
<p>Let <em>K</em> be a <a href="field_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">field</a>, and <em>L</em> ⊇ <em>K</em> be an algebraically closed extension. An <a href="affine_algebraic_set" title="wikilink">affine algebraic set</a> <em>V</em> is the set of the common <a href="zero_of_a_function" title="wikilink">zeros</a> in <em>L</em><sup><em>n</em></sup> of the elements of an ideal <em>I</em> in a polynomial ring <span class="LaTeX">$R=K[x_1, \ldots, x_n].$</span> Let <em>A</em>=<em>R</em>/<em>I</em> be the algebra of the polynomials over <em>V</em>. The dimension of <em>V</em> is any of the following integers. It does not change if <em>K</em> is enlarged, if <em>L</em> is replaced by another algebraically closed extension of <em>K</em> and if <em>I</em> is replaced by another ideal having the same zeros (that is having the same <a href="radical_of_an_ideal" title="wikilink">radical</a>). The dimension is also independent of the choice of coordinates; in other words is does not change if the <em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> are replaced by linearly independent linear combinations of them. The dimension of <em>V</em> is</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The maximal length</em> <span class="LaTeX">$d$</span> of the chains <span class="LaTeX">$V_0\subset V_1\subset \ldots \subset V_d$</span> <em>of distinct nonempty subvarieties.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This definition generalizes a property of the dimension of a <a href="Euclidean_space" title="wikilink">Euclidean space</a> or a <a href="vector_space" title="wikilink">vector space</a>. It is thus probably the definition that gives the easiest intuitive description of the notion.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The <a href="Krull_dimension" title="wikilink">Krull dimension</a> of A.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This is the transcription of the preceding definition in the language of <a href="commutative_algebra" title="wikilink">commutative algebra</a>, the Krull dimension being the maximal length of the chains <span class="LaTeX">$p_0\subset p_1\subset \ldots \subset p_d$</span> of <a href="prime_ideal" title="wikilink">prime ideals</a> of <em>A</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The maximal Krull dimension of the <a href="local_ring" title="wikilink">local rings</a> at the points of V</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This definition shows that the dimension is a <em>local property</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>If V is a variety, the Krull dimension of the local ring at any <a href="Singular_point_of_an_algebraic_variety" title="wikilink">regular point</a> of V</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This shows that the dimension is constant on a variety</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The maximal dimension of the <a href="tangent_space" title="wikilink">tangent vector spaces</a> at the non <a href="singular_point_of_an_algebraic_variety" title="wikilink">singular points</a> of V</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This relies the dimension of a variety to that of a <a href="differentiable_manifold" title="wikilink">differentiable manifold</a>. More precisely, if <em>V</em> if defined over the reals, then the set of its real regular points is a differentiable manifold that has the same dimension as variety and as a manifold.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>If V is a variety, the dimension of the <a href="tangent_space" title="wikilink">tangent vector space</a> at any non <a href="singular_point_of_an_algebraic_variety" title="wikilink">singular point</a> of V</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the algebraic analogue to the fact that a connected <a class="uri" href="manifold" title="wikilink">manifold</a> has a constant dimension.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The number of <a href="hyperplane" title="wikilink">hyperplanes</a> or <a href="hypersurface" title="wikilink">hypersurfaces</a> in <a href="general_position" title="wikilink">general position</a> which are needed to have an intersection with V which is reduced to a nonzero finite number of points.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This definition is not intrinsic as it apply only to algebraic sets that are explicitly embedded in an affine or projective space.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The maximal length of a <a href="regular_sequence" title="wikilink">regular sequence</a> in A</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This the algebraic translation of the preceding definition.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The difference between n and the maximal length of the regular sequences contained in I</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the algebraic translation of the fact that the intersection of <em>n</em>-<em>d</em> hypersurfaces is, in general, an algebraic set of dimension <em>d</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The degree of the <a href="Hilbert_polynomial" title="wikilink">Hilbert polynomial</a> of A</em>.</li>
<li><em>The degree of the denominator of the <a href="Hilbert_series" title="wikilink">Hilbert series</a> of A</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows, through a <a href="Gröbner_basis" title="wikilink">Gröbner basis</a> computation to compute the dimension of the algebraic set defined by a given <a href="system_of_polynomial_equations" title="wikilink">system of polynomial equations</a></p>
<ul>
<li><em>If I is a prime ideal (i.e. V is an algebraic variety), the <a href="transcendence_degree" title="wikilink">transcendence degree</a> over K of the <a href="field_of_fractions" title="wikilink">field of fractions</a> of A</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows to prove easily that the dimension is invariant under <a href="birational_equivalence" title="wikilink">birational equivalence</a>.</p>
<h2 id="dimension-of-a-projective-algebraic-set">Dimension of a projective algebraic set</h2>
<p>Let <em>V</em> be a <a href="projective_algebraic_set" title="wikilink">projective algebraic set</a> defined as the set of the common zeros of a homogeneous ideal <em>I</em> in a polynomial ring <span class="LaTeX">$R=K[x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n]$</span> over a field <em>K</em>, and let <em>A</em>=<em>R</em>/<em>I</em> be the <a href="graded_algebra" title="wikilink">graded algebra</a> of the polynomials over <em>V</em>.</p>
<p>All the definitions of the previous section apply, with the change that, when <em>A</em> or <em>I</em> appear explicitly in the definition, the value of the dimension must be reduced by one. For example, the dimension of <em>V</em> is one less than the Krull dimension of <em>A</em>.</p>
<h2 id="computation-of-the-dimension">Computation of the dimension</h2>
<p>Given a <a href="system_of_polynomial_equations" title="wikilink">system of polynomial equations</a>, it may be difficult to compute the dimension of the algebraic set that it defines.</p>
<p>Without further information on the system, there is only one practical method that consists to compute a Gröbner basis and to deduce the degree of the denominator of the <a href="Hilbert_series" title="wikilink">Hilbert series</a> of the ideal generated by the equations.</p>
<p>The second step, which is usually the fastest, may be accelerated in the following way: Firstly, the Gröbner basis is replaced by the list of its leading monomials (this is already done for the computation of the Hilbert series). Then each monomial like <span class="LaTeX">${x_1}^{e_1}\cdots {x_n}^{e_n}$</span> is replaced by the product of the variables in it<span class="LaTeX">$$x_1^{\min (e_1,1)}\cdots x_n^{\min(e_n,1)}.$$</span> Then the dimension is the maximal size of a subset <em>S</em> of the variables, such that none of these products of variables depends only on the variables in <em>S</em>.</p>
<p>This algorithm is implemented in several <a href="computer_algebra_system" title="wikilink">computer algebra systems</a>. For example in <a href="Maple_(software)" title="wikilink">Maple</a>, this is the function <em>Groebner[HilbertDimension]</em>.</p>
<h2 id="real-dimension">Real dimension</h2>
<p>The <em>dimension</em> of a set of real points, typically a <a href="semialgebraic_set" title="wikilink">semialgebraic set</a>, is the dimension of its <a href="Zariski_closure" title="wikilink">Zariski closure</a>. For an algebraic set defined over the <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">reals</a> (that is defined by polynomials with real coefficients), it may occur that the dimension of the set of its real points differs from its dimension. For example, the <a href="algebraic_surface" title="wikilink">algebraic surface</a> of equation <span class="LaTeX">$x^2+y^2+z^2=0$</span> is an algebraic variety of dimension two, which has only one real point (0, 0, 0), and thus the real dimension zero.</p>
<p>The real dimension is more difficult to compute than the algebraic dimension, and, to date, there is no available software to compute it.</p>
