<h1>Gleason's theorem</h1>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Gleason's theorem</strong> (named after <a href="Andrew_M._Gleason" title="wikilink">Andrew M. Gleason</a>) is a mathematical result which is of particular importance for the field of <a href="quantum_logic" title="wikilink">quantum logic</a>. It proves that the <a href="Born_rule" title="wikilink">Born rule</a> for the probability of obtaining specific results for a given measurement follows naturally from the structure formed by the <a href="Lattice_(order)" title="wikilink">lattice</a> of events in a <a href="Real_number" title="wikilink">real</a> or <a href="Complex_number" title="wikilink">complex</a> <a href="Hilbert_space" title="wikilink">Hilbert space</a>. The theorem states:</p>
<dl>
<dd><strong>Theorem</strong>. Suppose <em>H</em> is a separable <a href="Hilbert_space" title="wikilink">Hilbert space</a> of complex dimension at least 3. Then for any quantum probability measure on the <a class="uri" href="lattice" title="wikilink">lattice</a> <em>Q</em> of <a class="uri" href="self-adjoint" title="wikilink">self-adjoint</a> projection operators on <em>H</em> there exists a unique <a href="trace_class" title="wikilink">trace class</a> operator <em>W</em> such that <em>P</em>(<em>E</em>) = <strong>Tr</strong>(<em>W</em> <em>E</em>) for any self-adjoint projection <em>E</em> in <em>Q</em>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The lattice of projections <em>Q</em> can be interpreted as the set of <a href="Quantum_logic#The_propositional_lattice_of_a_quantum_mechanical_system" title="wikilink">quantum propositions</a>, each proposition having the form "<em>a</em> ≤ <em>A</em> ≤ <em>b</em>", where <em>A</em> is the <a href="quantum_measurement" title="wikilink">measured value</a> of some <a class="uri" href="observable" title="wikilink">observable</a> on <em>H</em> (given by a self-adjoint linear operator). The trace-class operator <em>W</em> can be interpreted as the <a href="density_matrix" title="wikilink">density matrix</a> of a <a href="quantum_state" title="wikilink">quantum state</a>. Effectively, the theorem says that any legitimate probability measure on the space of allowable propositions is generated by some quantum state. This implies that the Standard Quantum Logic can be viewed as a manifold of interlocking perspectives that cannot be embedded into a single perspective [Edwards]. Hence, the perspectives cannot be viewed as perspectives on one real world. So, even considering one world as a methodological principle breaks down in the quantum micro-domain.</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p><a href="Quantum_logic" title="wikilink">Quantum logic</a> treats quantum events (or measurement outcomes) as <a href="propositional_logic" title="wikilink">logical propositions</a>, and studies the relationships and structures formed by these events, with specific emphasis on <a href="Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">quantum measurement</a>. More formally, a "quantum logic" is a set of events that is <a href="closure_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">closed</a> under the operation of <a class="uri" href="disjunction" title="wikilink">disjunction</a> of <a href="Countable_set" title="wikilink">countably many</a> <a href="Mutual_exclusivity" title="wikilink">mutually exclusive</a> events. The <em><a href="representation_theorem" title="wikilink">representation theorem</a></em> in quantum logic shows that such a logic forms a <a href="Lattice_(order)" title="wikilink">lattice</a> which is <a href="Isomorphism" title="wikilink">isomorphic</a> to the lattice of <a href="Space_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">subspaces</a> of a <a href="vector_space" title="wikilink">vector space</a> with a <a href="scalar_product" title="wikilink">scalar product</a>.</p>
<p>It remains an open problem in quantum logic to prove that the <a href="field_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">field</a> <em>K</em> over which the vector space is defined must be either the <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real numbers</a>, <a href="complex_number" title="wikilink">complex numbers</a>, or the <a href="quaternion" title="wikilink">quaternions</a>. This would have negative implications for the possibility of a <a href="p-adic_quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">p-adic quantum mechanics</a>. This is a necessary result for Gleason's theorem to be applicable, since in these three cases (but not for the p-adics) the definition of the <a href="inner_product" title="wikilink">inner product</a> of a <a href="vector_space" title="wikilink">vector</a> with itself makes the vector space in question into a Hilbert space. Solèr's Theorem, which under certain hypotheses restricts the field to just these three fields <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2010/12/solers_theorem.html">1</a>, suggests negative implications for the possibility of a <a href="p-adic_quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">p-adic quantum mechanics</a>.</p>
<h2 id="application">Application</h2>
<p>The representation theorem allows us to treat quantum events as a lattice <em>L = L(H)</em> of subspaces of a real or complex Hilbert space. Gleason's theorem allows us to "attach" these events to probabilities. This section draws extensively from the analysis presented in Pitowsky (2005).</p>
<p>We let <em>A</em> represent an observable with finitely many potential outcomes: the eigenvalues of the <a href="Hermitian_operator" title="wikilink">Hermitian operator</a> <em>A</em>, i.e. <span class="LaTeX">$\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, ..., \alpha_n$</span>. An "event", then, is a proposition <span class="LaTeX">$x_i$</span>, which in natural language can be rendered "the outcome of measuring <em>A</em> on the system is <span class="LaTeX">$\alpha_i$</span>". The events <span class="LaTeX">$x_i$</span> generate a sublattice of the Hilbert space which is a finite <a href="Boolean_algebra" title="wikilink">Boolean algebra</a>, and if <em>n</em> is the dimension of the Hilbert space, then each event is an atom.</p>
<p>A <em>quantum probability function</em> over <em>H</em> is a <a href="real_function" title="wikilink">real function</a> <em>P</em> on the atoms in <em>L</em> that has the following properties:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="LaTeX">$P(0) = 0$</span>, and <span class="LaTeX">$P(y) \ge 0$</span> for all <span class="LaTeX">$y \in L$</span></li>
<li><span class="LaTeX">$\sum_{j=1}^n P(x_j) = 1$</span>, if <span class="LaTeX">$x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n$</span> are orthogonal atoms</li>
</ol>
<p>This means for every lattice element <em>y</em>, the probability of obtaining <em>y</em> as a measurement outcome is known, since it may be expressed as the union of the atoms under <em>y</em><span class="LaTeX">$$P(y) = \Sigma \{ P(x_j) | x_j \le y \}$$</span><span class="LaTeX">$$</span></p>
<p>In this context, Gleason's theorem states:</p>
<dl>
<dd>''Given a quantum probability function P over a space of dimension <span class="LaTeX">$\ge 3$</span>, there is an Hermitian, non-negative operator W on H, whose trace is unity, such that <span class="LaTeX">$P(x) = \langle \mathbf{x}, W \mathbf{x} \rangle$</span> for all atoms <span class="LaTeX">$x \in L$</span>, where <span class="LaTeX">$\langle\,  ,\, \rangle$</span> is the inner product, and <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{x}$</span> is a unit vector along <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As one consequence: if some <span class="LaTeX">$x_0$</span> satisfies <span class="LaTeX">$P(x_0) = 1$</span>, then <em>W</em> is the projection onto the complex line spanned by <span class="LaTeX">$x_0$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$P(x) = \left| \langle\mathbf{x_0}, \mathbf{x} \rangle \right|^2$</span> for all <span class="LaTeX">$x \in L$</span>.</p>
<p>The theorem expresses the <a href="Born_rule" title="wikilink">Born rule</a> for probability in quantum mechanics. The theorem presumes that the underlying set of numbers that the functions are defined over are <a href="real_numbers" title="wikilink">real numbers</a> or <a href="complex_numbers" title="wikilink">complex numbers</a>. A constructive proof exists.</p>
<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>
<p>Gleason's theorem highlights a number of fundamental issues in quantum measurement theory. The fact that the logical structure of quantum events dictates the probability measure of the formalism is taken by some to demonstrate an inherent <a href="stochastic" title="wikilink">stochasticity</a> in the very fabric of the world. To some researchers, such as Pitowski, the result is convincing enough to conclude that quantum mechanics represents a new theory of probability. Alternatively, such approaches as <a href="relational_quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">relational quantum mechanics</a> make use of Gleason's theorem as an essential step in deriving the quantum formalism from <a href="Information_theory" title="wikilink">information-theoretic</a> postulates.</p>
<p>The theorem is often taken to rule out the possibility of hidden variables in quantum mechanics. This is because the theorem implies that there can be no <a href="Bivalence" title="wikilink">bivalent</a> probability measures, i.e. probability measures having only the values 1 and 0. To see this, note that the mapping <span class="LaTeX">$u \rightarrow \langle Wu, u \rangle$</span> is continuous on the <a href="unit_sphere" title="wikilink">unit sphere</a> of the Hilbert space for any density operator <em>W</em>. Since this unit sphere is <a href="Connected_(topology)" title="wikilink">connected</a>, no continuous function on it can take only the value of 0 and 1. (Wilce (2006), pg. 3) But, a <a href="hidden_variable_theory" title="wikilink">hidden variables</a> theory which is <a href="determinism" title="wikilink">deterministic</a> implies that the probability of a given outcome is <em>always</em> either 0 or 1: either the electron's spin is up, or it isn't (which accords with <a href="Classical_mechanics" title="wikilink">classical</a> intuitions). Gleason's theorem therefore seems to hint that quantum theory represents a deep and fundamental departure from the classical way of looking at the world, and that this departure is <em>logical</em>, not <em>interpretational</em>, in nature.</p>
