<h1>Screw</h1>
<hr/>

<p> A <strong>screw</strong>, or <strong>bolt</strong>, is a type of <a class="uri" href="fastener" title="wikilink">fastener</a>, typically made of metal, and characterized by a <a href="helix" title="wikilink">helical</a> ridge, known as a <em>male thread</em> (external thread) or just <em><a href="Screw_thread" title="wikilink">thread</a></em>, wrapped around a cylinder. Some screw threads are designed to mate with a complementary thread, known as a <em>female thread</em> (internal thread), often in the form of a <a href="nut_(hardware)" title="wikilink">nut</a> or an object that has the internal thread formed into it. Other screw threads are designed to cut a helical groove in a softer material as the screw is inserted. The most common uses of screws are to hold objects together and to position objects.</p>

<p>A screw will almost always have a <em>head</em> on one end which contains a specially formed shape that allows it to be turned, or <em>driven</em>, with a tool. Common tools for driving screws include <a href="screwdriver" title="wikilink">screwdrivers</a> and <a href="wrench" title="wikilink">wrenches</a>. The head is usually larger than the body of the screw, which keeps the screw from being driven deeper than the length of the screw and to provide a <em><a href="bearing_surface" title="wikilink">bearing surface</a></em>. There are exceptions; for instance, carriage bolts have a domed head that is not designed to be driven; <a href="set_screw" title="wikilink">set screws</a> often have a head smaller than the outer <a class="uri" href="diameter" title="wikilink">diameter</a> of the screw; J-bolts have a J-shaped head which is not designed to be driven, but rather is usually sunk into concrete allowing it to be used as an anchor bolt. The cylindrical portion of the screw from the underside of the head to the tip is known as the <em>shank</em>; it may be fully threaded or partially threaded.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The distance between each thread is called the "pitch".</p>

<p>The majority of screws are tightened by <a href="clockwise_and_counterclockwise" title="wikilink">clockwise</a> rotation, which is termed a <em>right-hand thread</em>; a common <a href="mnemonic_device" title="wikilink">mnemonic device</a> for remembering this when working with screws or bolts is "righty-tighty, lefty-loosey." Screws with left-hand threads are used in exceptional cases. For example, when the screw will be subject to counterclockwise torque (which would work to undo a right-hand thread), a left-hand-threaded screw would be an appropriate choice. The left side <a href="Bicycle_pedal#Attachment" title="wikilink">pedal</a> of a <a class="uri" href="bicycle" title="wikilink">bicycle</a> has a left-hand thread.</p>

<p>More generally, screw may mean any helical device, such as a clamp, a <a class="uri" href="micrometer" title="wikilink">micrometer</a>, a ship's <a class="uri" href="propeller" title="wikilink">propeller</a> or an <a href="Archimedes'_screw" title="wikilink">Archimedes' screw</a> water pump.</p>
<h2 id="differentiation-between-bolt-and-screw">Differentiation between bolt and screw</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>There is no universally accepted distinction between a screw and a bolt. A simple distinction that is often true, although not always, is that a bolt passes through a substrate and takes a nut on the other side, whereas a screw takes no nut because it threads directly into the substrate. <em><a href="Machinery's_Handbook" title="wikilink">Machinery's Handbook</a></em> describes the distinction as follows:</p>

<p><mtpl></mtpl></p>

<p>This distinction is consistent with <a href="ASME" title="wikilink">ASME B18.2.1</a> and some dictionary definitions for <em>screw</em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and <em>bolt</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>The issue of what is a screw and what is a bolt is not completely resolved with <em>Machinery's Handbook</em> distinction, however, because of confounding terms, the ambiguous nature of some parts of the distinction, and usage variations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Some of these issues are discussed below:</p>
<h3 id="machine-screws">Machine screws</h3>

<p>ASME standards specify a variety of "Machine Screws"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> in diameters ranging up to . These fasteners are often used with nuts as well as driven into tapped holes. They might be considered a screw or a bolt based on the <em>Machinery's Handbook</em> distinction. In practice, they tend to be mostly available in smaller sizes and the smaller sizes are referred to as screws or less ambiguously as machine screws, although some kinds of machine screw can be referred to as stove bolts.</p>
<h3 id="hex-cap-screws">Hex cap screws</h3>

<p>ASME standard B18.2.1-1996 specifies Hex Cap Screws that range in size from  in <a class="uri" href="diameter" title="wikilink">diameter</a>. These fasteners are very similar to hex bolts. They differ mostly in that they are manufactured to tighter tolerances than the corresponding bolts. <em>Machinery's Handbook</em> refers parenthetically to these fasteners as "Finished Hex Bolts".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Reasonably, these fasteners might be referred to as bolts, but based on the US government document <em>Distinguishing Bolts from Screws</em>, the US government might classify them as screws because of the tighter tolerance.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In 1991 responding to an influx of counterfeit fasteners Congress passed PL 101-592<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> "Fastener Quality Act" This resulted in the rewriting of specifications by the ASME B18 committee. B18.2.1<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> was re-written and as a result they eliminated the "Finished Hex Bolts" and renamed them the "Hex Cap Screw"â€”a term that had existed in common usage long before, but was now also being codified as an official name for the ASME B18 standard.</p>
<h3 id="lug-bolts-and-head-bolts">Lug bolts and head bolts</h3>

<p>These terms refer to fasteners that are designed to be threaded into a tapped hole that is in part of the assembly and so based on the <em>Machinery's Handbook</em> distinction they would be screws. Here common terms are at variance with <em>Machinery's Handbook</em> distinction.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="lag-screw">Lag screw</h3>

<p> <strong>Lag screws</strong> (also called <strong>lag bolts</strong>, although this is a <a class="uri" href="misnomer" title="wikilink">misnomer</a>) are basically large wood screws. Square-headed lag screws and hex-headed lag screws are covered by ASME B18.2.1 standards, and the head is typically an external hex. A typical lag bolt can range in diameter from  to , and lengths from  or longer, with the coarse threads of a wood-screw or sheet-metal-screw threadform (but larger).</p>

<p>The materials are usually carbon steel substrate with a coating of zinc <a class="uri" href="galvanization" title="wikilink">galvanization</a> (for corrosion resistance). The zinc coating may be bright (electroplated), yellow (electroplated), or dull gray <a href="hot-dip_galvanizing" title="wikilink">hot-dip galvanized</a>. Lag bolts are used to lag together lumber framing, to lag machinery feet to wood floors, and for other heavy carpentry applications. The adjective <em>lag</em> came from an early principal use of such fasteners: the fastening of <a href="wikt:lag#Noun" title="wikilink">lags</a> such as barrel staves and other similar parts.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>These fasteners are "screws" according to the <em>Machinery's Handbook</em> criteria, and the obsolescent term "lag bolt" has been replaced by "lag screw" in the <em>Handbook</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> However, in the minds of many tradesmen, they are "bolts", simply because they are large, with hex or square heads. In the United Kingdom, lag screws are known as <strong>coach screws</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="government-standards">Government standards</h3>

<p>The <a href="US_government" title="wikilink">US government</a> made an effort to formalize the difference between a bolt and a screw because different <a class="uri" href="tariffs" title="wikilink">tariffs</a> apply to each.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The document seems to have no significant effect on common usage and does not eliminate the ambiguous nature of the distinction between screws and bolts for some threaded fasteners. The document also reflects (although it probably did not originate) significant confusion of terminology usage that differs between the legal/statutory/regulatory community and the fastener industry. The legal/statutory/regulatory wording uses the terms "coarse" and "fine" to refer to the tightness of the <a href="engineering_tolerance" title="wikilink">tolerance</a> range, referring basically to "high-quality" or "low-quality", but this is a poor choice of terms, because those terms in the fastener industry have a different meaning (referring to <a href="Screw_thread#Coarse_versus_fine" title="wikilink">the steepness of the helix's lead</a>).</p>
<h3 id="historical-issue">Historical issue</h3>

<p>Old <a href="United_States_Standard" title="wikilink">USS</a> and <a href="Society_of_Automotive_Engineers" title="wikilink">SAE</a> standards defined cap screws as fasteners with shanks that were threaded to the head and bolts as fasteners with shanks that were partially unthreaded.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The relationship of this rule to the idea that a bolt by definition takes a nut is clear (because the unthreaded section of the shank, which is called the <em>grip</em>, was expected to pass through the substrate without threading into it). This is now an obsolete distinction.</p>
<h3 id="controlled-vocabulary-versus-natural-language">Controlled vocabulary versus natural language</h3>

<p>The distinctions above are enforced in the <a href="controlled_vocabulary" title="wikilink">controlled vocabulary</a> of <a href="standards_organization" title="wikilink">standards organizations</a>. Nevertheless, there are sometimes differences between the controlled vocabulary and the <a href="natural_language" title="wikilink">natural language</a> use of the words by machinists, auto mechanics and others. These differences reflect linguistic evolution shaped by the <a href="History_of_technology" title="wikilink">changing of technology over centuries</a>. The words <em>bolt</em> and <em>screw</em> have both existed since before today's modern mix of fastener types existed, and the natural usage of those words has evolved <a href="retronym" title="wikilink">retronymously</a> in response to the technological change. (That is, the use of words as names for objects changes as the objects themselves change.) Non-threaded fasteners predominated until the advent of practical, inexpensive screw-cutting in the early 19th century. The basic meaning of the word <em>screw</em> has long involved the idea of a helical screw thread, but the Archimedes screw and the screw <a href="gimlet_(tool)" title="wikilink">gimlet</a> (like a corkscrew) preceded the fastener.</p>

<p>The word <em>bolt</em> is also a very old word, and it was used for centuries to refer to metal rods that passed through the substrate to be fastened on the other side, often via nonthreaded means (clinching, forge welding, pinning, wedging, etc.). The connection of this sense to the sense of a door bolt or the <a class="uri" href="crossbow" title="wikilink">crossbow</a> bolt is apparent. In the 19th century, bolts fastened via screw threads were often called <em>screw bolts</em> in contradistinction to <a href="Clinker_(boat_building)#Fastening_the_centre-line_structure" title="wikilink"><em>clench bolts</em></a>.</p>

<p>In common usage, the distinction (not rigorous) is often that screws are smaller than bolts, and that screws are generally tapered while bolts are not. For example, <a href="cylinder_head" title="wikilink">cylinder head</a> bolts are called "bolts" (at least in North American usage) despite the fact that by some definitions they ought to be called "screws". Their size and their similarity to a bolt that would take a nut seem linguistically to overrule any other factors in this <a href="natural_language" title="wikilink">natural</a> word choice proclivity.</p>
<h4 id="other-distinctions">Other distinctions</h4>

<p>Bolts have been defined as headed fasteners having external threads that meet an exacting, uniform bolt thread specification (such as <a href="ISO_metric_screw_thread" title="wikilink">ISO metric screw thread</a> M, MJ, <a href="Unified_Thread_Standard" title="wikilink">Unified Thread Standard</a> UN, UNR, and UNJ) such that they can accept a non-tapered nut. Screws are then defined as headed, externally threaded fasteners that do not meet the above definition of bolts. These definitions of screw and bolt eliminate the ambiguity of the <em>Machinery's handbook</em> distinction. And it is for that reason, perhaps, that some people favor them. However, they are neither compliant with common usage of the two words nor are they compliant with formal specifications.</p>

<p>A possible distinction is that a screw is designed to cut its own thread; it has no need for access from or exposure to the opposite side of the component being fastened to. This definition of screw is further reinforced by the consideration of the developments of fasteners such as Tek Screws for roof cladding, self-drilling and self-tapping screws for various metal fastening applications, roof batten screws to reinforce the connection between the roof batten and the rafter, decking screws etc. On the other hand, a bolt is the male part of a fastener system designed to be accepted by a pre-equipped socket (or nut) of exactly the same thread design.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-screw-and-bolt">Types of screw and bolt</h2>

<p>Threaded fasteners either have a tapered shank or a non-tapered shank. Fasteners with tapered shanks are designed to either be driven into a substrate directly or into a pilot hole in a substrate. Mating threads are formed in the substrate as these fasteners are driven in. Fasteners with a non-tapered shank are designed to mate with a nut or to be driven into a tapped hole.</p>

<p>The term cap screw refers to many different things at different times and places. Currently, it most narrowly refers to a style of head (see the gallery below). More broadly, and more commonly, it refers to the group of screws: shoulder screws, hex heads, counter-sunk heads, button heads, and fillister heads. In the US, cap screws are defined by ASME B18.6.2 and ASME B18.3.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In the past, the term <em>cap screw</em>, in general, referred to screws that were supposed to be used in applications where a nut was not used, however the characteristics that differentiated it from a bolt vary over time. In 1910, Anthony defined it as screw with a hex head that was thicker than a bolt head, but the distance across the flats was less than a bolt's.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In 1913, Woolley and Meredith defined them like Anthony, but gave the following dimensions: hex head cap screws up to and including  have a head that is  larger than the shank diameter; screws greater than  in diameter have a head that is  larger than the shank. Square head cap screws up to and including  have a head  larger than the shank; screws larger than  have a head  larger than the shank.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In 1919, Dyke defined them as screws that are threaded all the way to the head.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> A socket cap screw, also known as a <em>socket head capscrew</em>, <em>socket screw</em>, or <em>Allen bolt</em>, is a type of cap screw with a cylindrical head and hexagonal drive hole. The term <em>socket head capscrew</em> typically refers to a type of threaded fastener whose head diameter is <a href="Real_versus_nominal_value" title="wikilink">nominally</a> 1.5 times that of the screw shank (<a href="major_diameter" title="wikilink">major</a>) diameter, with a head height equal to the shank diameter (1960 series design). <a href="forging" title="wikilink">Forged</a> <a href="heat_treat" title="wikilink">heat-treated</a> <a class="uri" href="alloy" title="wikilink">alloy</a> examples are high strength fasteners intended for the most demanding mechanical applications, with special alloy formulations available that are capable of maintaining strength at temperatures in excess of 1000 degrees F (587 degrees C).

A rib neck carriage bolt has several longitudinal ribs instead of the square section, to grip into a metal part being fixed.</p></td>

<p>A superbolt, or <a href="multi-jackbolt_tensioner" title="wikilink">multi-jackbolt tensioner</a> is an alternative type of fastener that retrofits or replaces existing nuts, bolts, or studs. Tension in the bolt is developed by torquing individual jackbolts, which are threaded through the body of the nut and push against a hardened washer. Because of this, the amount of torque required to achieve a given preload is reduced. Installation and removal of any size tensioner is achieved with hand tools, which can be advantageous when dealing with large diameter bolting applications.</p>

Like aerospace and nuclear power, this field involves some of the highest technology for fasteners, as well as some of the highest prices, for the simple reason that performance, longevity, and quality have to be excellent in such applications. Bone screws tend to be made of stainless steel or titanium, and they often have high-end features such as conical threads, multistart threads, cannulation (hollow core), and proprietary <a href="list_of_screw_drives" title="wikilink">screw drive</a> types (some not seen outside of these applications).</p>

<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>

<p>Screws and bolts are usually made of <a class="uri" href="steel" title="wikilink">steel</a>. Where great resistance to weather or corrosion is required, like in very small screws or medical implants, materials such as <a href="stainless_steel" title="wikilink">stainless steel</a>, <a class="uri" href="brass" title="wikilink">brass</a>, <a class="uri" href="titanium" title="wikilink">titanium</a>, <a class="uri" href="bronze" title="wikilink">bronze</a>, silicon bronze or monel may be used.</p>

<p><a href="Galvanic_corrosion" title="wikilink">Galvanic corrosion</a> of dissimilar metals can be prevented (using <a href="aluminium" title="wikilink">aluminum</a> screws for double-glazing tracks for example) by a careful choice of material. Some types of plastic, such as <a class="uri" href="nylon" title="wikilink">nylon</a> or <a class="uri" href="polytetrafluoroethylene" title="wikilink">polytetrafluoroethylene</a> (PTFE), can be threaded and used for fastenings requiring moderate strength and great resistance to corrosion or for the purpose of electrical <a href="Electrical_insulation" title="wikilink">insulation</a>.</p>

<p>Often a surface coating is used to protect the fastener from corrosion (e.g. bright zinc plating for steel screws), to impart a decorative finish (e.g. <a class="uri" href="japanning" title="wikilink">japanning</a>) or otherwise alter the surface properties of the base material.</p>

<p>Selection criteria of the screw materials include: size, required strength, resistance to corrosion, joint material, cost and temperature.</p>
<h2 id="bolted-joints">Bolted joints</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>The <a href="American_Institute_of_Steel_Construction" title="wikilink">American Institute of Steel Construction</a> (<a class="uri" href="AISC" title="wikilink">AISC</a>) 13th Edition Steel Design Manual section 16.1 chapter J-3 specifies the requirements for bolted structural connections. Structural bolts replaced rivets due to decreasing cost and increasing strength of structural bolts in the 20th century. Connections are formed with two types of joints: slip-critical connections and bearing connections. In slip-critical connections, movement of the connected parts is a serviceability condition and bolts are tightened to a minimum required pretension. Slip is prevented through friction of the "faying" surface, that is the plane of shear for the bolt and where two members make contact. Because friction is proportional to the normal force, connections must be sized with bolts numerous and large enough to provide the required load capacity. However, this greatly decreases the shear capacity of each bolt in the connection. The second type and more common connection is a bearing connection. In this type of connection the bolts carry the load through shear and are only tightened to a "snug-fit". These connections require fewer bolts than slip-critical connections and therefore are a less expensive alternative. Slip-critical connections are more common on flange plates for beam and column splices and moment critical connections. Bearing type connections are used in light weight structures and in member connections where slip is not important and prevention of structural failure is the design constraint. Common bearing type connections include: shear tabs, beam supports, gusset plates in trusses.</p>
<h2 id="mechanical-classifications">Mechanical classifications</h2>

<p>The numbers stamped on the head of the bolt are referred to the grade of the bolt used in certain application with the strength of a bolt. High-strength steel bolts usually have a hexagonal head with an <a href="International_Organization_for_Standardization" title="wikilink">ISO</a> strength rating (called <em>property class</em>) stamped on the head. And the absence of marking/number indicates a lower grade bolt with low strength. The property classes most often used are 5.8, 8.8, and 10.9. The number before the point is the <a href="ultimate_tensile_strength" title="wikilink">ultimate tensile strength</a> in <a href="megapascal" title="wikilink">MPa</a> divided by 100. The number after the point is the multiplier ratio of yield strength to ultimate tensile strength. For example, a property class 5.8 bolt has a nominal (minimum) ultimate tensile strength of 500 MPa, and a tensile yield strength of 0.8 times ultimate tensile strength or 0.8(500) = 400 MPa.</p>

<p>Ultimate tensile strength is the stress at which the bolt fails. Tensile yield strength is the stress at which the bolt will receive a permanent set (an elongation from which it will not recover when the force is removed) of 0.2% <a href="yield_strength#Definition" title="wikilink">offset strain</a>. When elongating a fastener prior to reaching the yield point, the fastener is said to be operating in the elastic region; whereas elongation beyond the yield point is referred to as operating in the plastic region, since the fastener has suffered permanent plastic deformation.</p>

<p>Mild steel bolts have property class 4.6. High-strength steel bolts have property class 8.8 or above.</p>

<p>The same type of screw or bolt can be made in many different grades of material. For critical high-tensile-strength applications, low-grade bolts may fail, resulting in damage or injury. On SAE-standard bolts, a distinctive pattern of marking is impressed on the heads to allow inspection and validation of the strength of the bolt. However, low-cost <a class="uri" href="counterfeit" title="wikilink">counterfeit</a> fasteners may be found with actual strength far less than indicated by the markings. Such inferior fasteners are a danger to life and property when used in aircraft, automobiles, heavy trucks, and similar critical applications.</p>
<h3 id="inch">Inch</h3>

<p><a href="SAE_J429" title="wikilink">SAE J429</a> defines the bolt grades for inch-system sized bolts and screws.

<p>Some varieties of screw are manufactured with a break-away head, which snaps off when adequate torque is applied. This prevents tampering and also provides an easily inspectable joint to guarantee proper assembly. An example of this is the shear bolts used on vehicle <a href="steering_column" title="wikilink">steering columns</a>, to secure the <a href="ignition_switch" title="wikilink">ignition switch</a>.</p>

<p>Modern screws employ a wide variety of drive designs, each requiring a different kind of tool to drive in or extract them. The most common screw drives are the slotted and Phillips in the US; hex, Robertson, and Torx are also common in some applications, and Pozidriv has almost completely replaced Phillips in Europe. Some types of drive are intended for automatic assembly in mass-production of such items as automobiles. More exotic screw drive types may be used in situations where tampering is undesirable, such as in electronic appliances that should not be serviced by the home repair person.</p>

</figure>

<p>The hand tool used to drive in most screws is called a <em><a class="uri" href="screwdriver" title="wikilink">screwdriver</a></em>. A power tool that does the same job is a <em>power screwdriver</em>; <a href="power_drill" title="wikilink">power drills</a> may also be used with screw-driving attachments. Where the holding power of the screwed joint is critical, torque-measuring and <em>torque-limiting screwdrivers</em> are used to ensure sufficient but not excessive force is developed by the screw. The hand tool for driving hex head threaded fasteners is a <em>spanner</em> (UK usage) or <em>wrench</em> (US usage), while a <em>nut setter</em> is used with a power screw driver.</p>
<h2 id="thread-standards">Thread standards</h2>

<p>There are many systems for specifying the dimensions of screws, but in much of the world the <a href="ISO_metric_screw_thread" title="wikilink">ISO metric screw thread</a> preferred series has displaced the many older systems. Other relatively common systems include the <a href="British_Standard_Whitworth" title="wikilink">British Standard Whitworth</a>, <a href="British_Association_screw_threads" title="wikilink">BA system (British Association)</a>, and the <a href="Unified_Thread_Standard" title="wikilink">Unified Thread Standard</a>.</p>
<h3 id="iso-metric-screw-thread">ISO metric screw thread</h3>

<p>The basic principles of the ISO metric screw thread are defined in <a href="international_standard" title="wikilink">international standard</a> <a href="ISO_68-1" title="wikilink">ISO 68-1</a> and preferred combinations of diameter and pitch are listed in ISO 261. The smaller subset of diameter and pitch combinations commonly used in screws, nuts and bolts is given in <a href="ISO_262" title="wikilink">ISO 262</a>. The most commonly used pitch value for each diameter is the <em>coarse pitch</em>. For some diameters, one or two additional <em>fine pitch</em> variants are also specified, for special applications such as threads in thin-walled pipes. ISO metric screw threads are designated by the letter <strong>M</strong> followed by the major diameter of the thread in millimeters (e.g. <em>M8</em>). If the thread does not use the normal <em>coarse pitch</em> (e.g. 1.25Â mm in the case of M8), then the pitch in millimeters is also appended with a <a href="multiplication_sign" title="wikilink">multiplication sign</a> (e.g. "M8Ã—1" if the screw thread has an outer diameter of 8Â mm and advances by 1Â mm per 360Â° rotation).</p>

<p>The nominal diameter of a metric screw is the outer diameter of the thread. The tapped hole (or nut) into which the screw fits, has an internal diameter which is the size of the screw minus the pitch of the thread. Thus, an M6 screw, which has a pitch of 1Â mm, is made by threading a 6Â mm shank, and the nut or threaded hole is made by tapping threads into a hole of 5Â mm diameter (6Â mm - 1Â mm).</p>

<p>Metric <a class="uri" href="hexagon" title="wikilink">hexagon</a> bolts, screws and nuts are specified, for example, in <a href="British_Standard" title="wikilink">British Standard</a> BSÂ 4190 (general purpose screws) and BSÂ 3692 (precision screws). The following table lists the relationship given in these standards between the thread size and the maximal width across the hexagonal flats (wrench size):</p>

<h3 id="whitworth">Whitworth</h3>

<p>The first person to create a standard (in about 1841) was the <a href="England" title="wikilink">English</a> <a class="uri" href="engineer" title="wikilink">engineer</a> Sir <a href="Joseph_Whitworth" title="wikilink">Joseph Whitworth</a>. Whitworth screw sizes are still used, both for repairing old machinery and where a coarser thread than the metric fastener thread is required. Whitworth became <em>British Standard Whitworth</em>, abbreviated to BSW (BS 84:1956) and the <em>British Standard Fine</em> (BSF) thread was introduced in 1908 because the Whitworth thread was too coarse for some applications. The <a href="thread_angle" title="wikilink">thread angle</a> was 55Â°, and the depth and pitch varied with the diameter of the thread (i.e., the bigger the bolt, the coarser the thread). Spanners for Whitworth bolts are marked with the size of the bolt, not the distance across the flats of the screw head.</p>

<p>The most common use of a Whitworth pitch nowadays is in all UK <a class="uri" href="scaffolding" title="wikilink">scaffolding</a>. Additionally, the standard photographic <a href="tripod_(photography)" title="wikilink">tripod</a> thread, which for small cameras is 1/4" Whitworth (20 tpi) and for medium/large format cameras is 3/8" Whitworth (16 tpi). It is also used for microphone stands and their appropriate clips, again in both sizes, along with "thread adapters" to allow the smaller size to attach to items requiring the larger thread. Note that while 1/4" <a href="Unified_National_Coarse" title="wikilink">UNC</a> bolts fit 1/4" BSW camera tripod bushes, <a href="yield_strength" title="wikilink">yield strength</a> is reduced by the different thread angles of 60Â° and 55Â° respectively.</p>
<h3 id="british-association-screw-thread">British Association screw thread</h3>

<p>British Association (BA) screw threads, named after the British Association for Advancement of Science, were devised in 1884 and standardised in 1903. Screws were described as "2BA", "4BA" etc., the odd numbers being rarely used, except in equipment made prior to the 1970s for telephone exchanges in the UK. This equipment made extensive use of odd-numbered BA screws, in orderâ€”it may be suspectedâ€”to reduce theft. BA threads are specified by British Standard BS 93:1951 "Specification for British Association (B.A.) screw threads with tolerances for sizes 0 B.A. to 16 B.A."</p>

<p>While not related to ISO metric screws, the sizes were actually defined in metric terms, a 0BA thread having a 6Â mm diameter and 1Â mm pitch. Other threads in the BA series are related to 0BA in a geometric series with the common factors 0.9 and 1.2. For example, a 4BA thread has pitch

Â mm (3.62mm). Although 0BA has the same diameter and pitch as ISO M6, the threads have different forms and are not compatible.</p>

<p>BA threads are still common in some niche applications. Certain types of fine machinery, such as moving-coil meters and clocks, tend to have BA threads wherever they are manufactured. BA sizes were also used extensively in aircraft, especially those manufactured in the United Kingdom. BA sizing is still used in railway signalling, mainly for the termination of electrical equipment and cabling.</p>

<p>BA threads are extensively used in Model Engineering where the smaller hex head sizes make scale fastenings easier to represent. As a result many UK Model Engineering suppliers still carry stocks of BA fasteners up to typically 8BA and 10BA. 5BA is also commonly used as it can be threaded onto 1/8 rod.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>

 inch and larger the size is given as a fraction; for sizes less than this an <a class="uri" href="integer" title="wikilink">integer</a> is used, ranging from 0 to 16. The integer sizes can be converted to the actual diameter by using the formula 0.060 + 0.013 * number. For example, a #4 screw is 0.060 + 0.013 * 4 = 0.112Â inches in diameter. For most size screws there are multiple TPI available, with the most common being designated a Unified Coarse Thread (UNC or UN) and Unified Fine Thread (UNF or UF). Note: In countries other than the United States and Canada, the ISO Metric Screw Thread System is primarily used today. Unlike most other countries the United States and Canada still use the Unified (Inch) Thread System. However, both are moving over to the ISO Metric System. It is estimated that approximately 60% of screw threads in use in the United States are still inch based.[67]</p>

<p>While a recent hypothesis attributes the <a href="Archimedes'_screw" title="wikilink">Archimedes' screw</a> to <a class="uri" href="Sennacherib" title="wikilink">Sennacherib</a>, King of <a class="uri" href="Assyria" title="wikilink">Assyria</a>, archaeological finds and pictorial evidence only appear in the <a href="Hellenistic_period" title="wikilink">Hellenistic period</a> and the standard view holds the device to be a <a href="Ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">Greek</a> invention, most probably by the 3rd century BC polymath <a class="uri" href="Archimedes" title="wikilink">Archimedes</a> himself.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Though resembling a screw, this is not a screw in the usual sense of the word.</p>

<p>Earlier, the screw had been described by the <a href="Greek_mathematics" title="wikilink">Greek mathematician</a> <a href="Archytas_of_Tarentum" title="wikilink">Archytas of Tarentum</a> (428â€“350 BC). By the 1st century BC, wooden screws were commonly used throughout the <a class="uri" href="Mediterranean" title="wikilink">Mediterranean</a> world in <a href="screw_press" title="wikilink">screw presses</a> for pressing <a href="olive_oil" title="wikilink">olive oil</a> from olives and pressing juice from grapes in <a class="uri" href="winemaking" title="wikilink">winemaking</a>. Metal screws used as fasteners were rare in Europe before the 15th century, if known at all.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<p>Rybczynski has shown<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> that handheld <a href="screwdriver" title="wikilink">screwdrivers</a> (formerly called "turnscrews" in English, in more direct parallel to their original French name, <em>tournevis</em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a>) have existed since medieval times (the 1580s at the latest), although they probably did not become truly widespread until after 1800, once threaded fasteners themselves had become commodified, as detailed below.</p>

<p>There were many forms of fastening in use before threaded fasteners became widespread. They tended to involve carpentry and smithing rather than machining, and they involved concepts such as <a href="dowel" title="wikilink">dowels</a> and pins, wedging, <a href="mortise_and_tenon" title="wikilink">mortises and tenons</a>, <a href="dovetail_joint" title="wikilink">dovetails</a>, <a href="nail_(fastener)" title="wikilink">nailing</a> (with or without clenching the nail ends), <a href="forge_welding" title="wikilink">forge welding</a>, and many kinds of binding with cord made of leather or fiber, using many kinds of <a href="knot" title="wikilink">knots</a>. Prior to the mid-19th century, <a href="Split_pin" title="wikilink">cotter pins</a> or <a href="clinker_(boat_building)#Fastening_the_centre-line_structure" title="wikilink">pin bolts</a>, and "clinch bolts" (now called <a href="Rivet#Types" title="wikilink">rivets</a>), were used in shipbuilding. <a href="Adhesive" title="wikilink">Glues</a> also existed, although not in the profusion seen today.</p>

<p>The metal screw did not become a common fastener until <a href="machine_tool" title="wikilink">machine tools</a> for their <a href="mass_production" title="wikilink">mass production</a> were developed toward the end of the 18th century. This development blossomed in the 1760s and 1770s<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> along two separate paths that soon <a href="technological_convergence" title="wikilink">converged</a>:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> the mass production of <em>wood</em> screws [meaning screws made of metal to be used in wood] in a specialized, single-purpose, high-volume-production machine tool; and the low-count, <a class="uri" href="toolroom" title="wikilink">toolroom</a>-style production of <em>machine</em> screws (V-thread) with easy selection among various pitches (whatever the machinist happened to need on any given day).</p>

<p>The first path was pioneered by brothers Job and William Wyatt of <a class="uri" href="Staffordshire" title="wikilink">Staffordshire</a>, UK,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> who patented in 1760 a machine that we might today best call a <a href="Automatic_lathe#Screw_machine" title="wikilink">screw machine</a> of an early and prescient sort. It made use of a leadscrew to guide the cutter to produce the desired pitch,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> and the slot was cut with a rotary file while the main spindle held still (presaging live tools on lathes 250 years later). Not until 1776 did the Wyatt brothers have a wood-screw factory up and running.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Their enterprise failed, but new owners soon made it prosper, and in the 1780s they were producing 16,000 screws a day with only 30 employees<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a>â€”the kind of industrial productivity and output volume that would later be characteristic of modern industry but was revolutionary at the time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, English instrument maker <a href="Jesse_Ramsden" title="wikilink">Jesse Ramsden</a> (1735â€“1800) was working on the <a href="tool_and_die_maker" title="wikilink">toolmaking</a> and <a href=":Category:Scientific_instrument_makers" title="wikilink">instrument-making</a> end of the screw-cutting problem, and in 1777 he invented the first satisfactory <a href="screw-cutting_lathe" title="wikilink">screw-cutting lathe</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The British engineer <a href="Henry_Maudslay" title="wikilink">Henry Maudslay</a> (1771â€“1831) gained fame by popularizing such lathes with his screw-cutting lathes of 1797 and 1800, containing the trifecta of leadscrew, slide rest, and change-gear gear train, all in the right proportions for industrial machining. In a sense he unified the paths of the Wyatts and Ramsden and did for machine screws what had already been done for wood screws, i.e., significant easing of production spurring <a class="uri" href="commodification" title="wikilink">commodification</a>. His firm would remain a leader in machine tools for decades afterward. A misquoting of <a href="James_Nasmyth" title="wikilink">James Nasmyth</a> popularized the notion that Maudslay had <em>invented</em> the slide rest, but this was incorrect; however, his lathes helped to popularize it.</p>

<p>These developments of the 1760â€“1800 era, with the Wyatts and Maudslay being arguably the most important drivers, caused great increase in the use of threaded fasteners. <a href="Screw_thread#History_of_standardization" title="wikilink">Standardization of threadforms</a> began almost immediately, but it was not quickly completed; it has been an evolving process ever since. Further improvements to the mass production of screws continued to push <a href="unit_price" title="wikilink">unit prices</a> lower and lower for decades to come, throughout the 19th century.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>

<p>The American developments of the <a href="turret_lathe" title="wikilink">turret lathe</a> (1840s) and of automatic <a href="automatic_lathe#Screw_machine" title="wikilink">screw machines</a> derived from it (1870s) drastically reduced the unit cost of threaded fasteners by increasingly automating the machine tool control. This <a href="demand_curve" title="wikilink">cost reduction spurred ever greater use</a> of screws.</p>

<p>Throughout the 19th century, the most commonly used forms of screw head (that is, <a href="List_of_screw_drives" title="wikilink">drive types</a>) were simple internal-wrenching straight slots and external-wrenching squares and hexagons. These were easy to <a href="Machining" title="wikilink">machine</a> and served most applications adequately. Rybczynski describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s through 1890s,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> but explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. In 1908, Canadian <a href="P._L._Robertson" title="wikilink">P. L. Robertson</a> was the first to make the internal-wrenching square socket drive a practical reality by developing just the right design (slight taper angles and overall proportions) to allow the head to be stamped easily but successfully, with the metal <a href="cold_forming" title="wikilink">cold forming</a> as desired rather than being sheared or displaced in unwanted ways.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Practical manufacture of the internal-wrenching hexagon drive (<a href="hex_key" title="wikilink">hex socket</a>) shortly followed in 1911.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

<p>In the early 1930s, the popular Phillips-head screw was invented by American <a href="Henry_F._Phillips" title="wikilink">Henry F. Phillips</a>.<ref>See:</ref></p>

<p>Threadform standardization further improved in the late 1940s, when the ISO metric screw thread and the Unified Thread Standard were defined.</p>

<p>Precision screws, for controlling motion rather than fastening, developed around the turn of the 19th century, were one of the central technical advances, along with flat surfaces, that enabled the industrial revolution.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> They are key components of micrometers and lathes.</p>
