<h1>Aristotelian physics</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Aristotelian physics</strong> is a form of <a href="Natural_sciences" title="wikilink">natural science</a> described in the works of the <a href="Ancient_Greek_philosophy" title="wikilink">Greek philosopher</a> <a class="uri" href="Aristotle" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a> (384–). In the <em><a href="Physics_(Aristotle)" title="wikilink">Physics</a></em>, Aristotle established general principles of change that govern all natural bodies, both living and inanimate, celestial and terrestrialincluding all motion, change with respect to place, change with respect to size or number, qualitative change of any kind; and "coming to be" (coming into <a class="uri" href="existence" title="wikilink">existence</a>, "generation") and "passing away" (no longer existing, "corruption").</p>

<p>To Aristotle, "physics" was a broad field that included subjects such as the <a href="philosophy_of_mind" title="wikilink">philosophy of mind</a>, <a href="sensory_experience" title="wikilink">sensory experience</a>, <a class="uri" href="memory" title="wikilink">memory</a>, <a class="uri" href="anatomy" title="wikilink">anatomy</a> and <a class="uri" href="biology" title="wikilink">biology</a>. It constitutes the foundation of the thought underlying <a href="Corpus_Aristotelicum#Physics_(the_study_of_nature)" title="wikilink">many</a> of his works.</p>
<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>

<p><mtpl></mtpl></p>

<p>While consistent with common human experience, Aristotle's principles were not based on controlled, quantitative experiments, so, while they account for many broad features of nature, they do not describe our universe in the precise, quantitative way now expected of science. Contemporaries of Aristotle like <a href="Aristarchus_of_Samos" title="wikilink">Aristarchus</a> rejected these principles in favor of <a class="uri" href="heliocentrism" title="wikilink">heliocentrism</a>, but their ideas were not widely accepted. Aristotle's principles were difficult to disprove merely through casual everyday observation, but later development of the <a href="scientific_method" title="wikilink">scientific method</a> challenged his views with <a href="experiment" title="wikilink">experiments</a> and careful measurement, using increasingly advanced technology such as the <a class="uri" href="telescope" title="wikilink">telescope</a> and <a href="vacuum_pump" title="wikilink">vacuum pump</a>.</p>

<h3 id="terrestrial-change">Terrestrial change</h3>

<p> Unlike the eternal and unchanging celestial <a href="Aether_(classical_element)" title="wikilink">aether</a>, each of the four terrestrial elements are capable of changing into either of the two elements they share a property with: e.g. the cold and wet (<a href="Water_(classical_element)" title="wikilink">water</a>) can transform into the hot and wet (<a href="Air_(classical_element)" title="wikilink">air</a>) or the cold and dry (<a href="Earth_(classical_element)" title="wikilink">earth</a>) and any apparent change into the hot and dry (<a href="Fire_(classical_element)" title="wikilink">fire</a>) is actually a <a href="Gray_code" title="wikilink">two-step</a> process. These properties are predicated of an actual substance relative to the work it is able to do; that of heating or chilling and of <a href="Desiccation" title="wikilink">desiccating</a> or moistening. The four elements exist <em>only</em> with regard to this capacity and relative to some potential work. The celestial element is eternal and unchanging, so only the four terrestrial elements account for "coming to be" and "passing away"or, in the terms of Aristotle's <a href="On_Generation_and_Corruption" title="wikilink"><em>De Generatione et Corruptione</em> (Περὶ γενέσεως καὶ φθορᾶς)</a>, "generation" and "corruption".</p>
<h3 id="elements">Elements</h3>

<p>According to Aristotle, the <a href="Classical_element" title="wikilink">elements</a> which compose the terrestrial spheres are different from that constituting the celestial spheres.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> He believed that four elements make up everything under the Moon, i.e. everything terrestrial: <a href="Earth_(classical_element)" title="wikilink">earth</a>, <a href="Air_(classical_element)" title="wikilink">air</a>, <a href="Fire_(classical_element)" title="wikilink">fire</a> and <a href="Water_(classical_element)" title="wikilink">water</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He also held that the heavens are made of a special weightless and incorruptible (i.e. unchangeable) fifth element called "<a href="Aether_(classical_element)" title="wikilink">aether</a>".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Aether also has the name "quintessence", meaning, literally, "fifth substance".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Aristotle considered heavy substances such as <a class="uri" href="iron" title="wikilink">iron</a> and other metals to consist primarily of the element earth, with a smaller amount of the other three terrestrial elements. Other, lighter objects, he believed, have less earth, relative to the other three elements in their composition.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="aether">Aether</h4>

<p>The Sun, Moon, planets and starsare embedded in perfectly concentric "<a href="Celestial_spheres" title="wikilink">crystal spheres</a>" that rotate eternally at fixed rates. Because the celestial spheres are incapable of any change except rotation, the terrestrial sphere of fire must account for the heat, starlight and occasional <a href="meteorite" title="wikilink">meteorites</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The lunar sphere is the only celestial sphere that actually comes in contact with the <a href="Sublunary_sphere" title="wikilink">sublunary orb's</a> changeable, terrestrial matter, dragging the rarefied fire and air along underneath as it rotates.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Like <a class="uri" href="Homer" title="wikilink">Homer</a>'s <a href="Aether_(mythology)" title="wikilink"><em>æthere</em> (αἰθήρ)</a>the "pure air" of <a href="Mount_Olympus" title="wikilink">Mount Olympus</a>was the divine counterpart of the air breathed by mortal beings (άήρ, <em>aer</em>). The celestial spheres are composed of the special element <em>aether</em>, eternal and unchanging, the sole capability of which is a uniform circular motion at a given rate (relative to the <a href="diurnal_motion" title="wikilink">diurnal motion</a> of the outermost sphere of fixed stars).</p>

<p>The concentric, aetherial, cheek-by-jowl "<a href="Celestial_spheres" title="wikilink">crystal spheres</a>" that carry the Sun, Moon and stars move eternally with unchanging circular motion. Spheres are embedded within spheres to account for the "wandering stars" (i.e. the <a href="Classical_planet" title="wikilink">planets</a>, which, in comparison with the Sun, Moon and stars, appear to move erratically). Later, the belief that all spheres are concentric was forsaken in favor of <a class="uri" href="Ptolemy" title="wikilink">Ptolemy</a>'s <a href="deferent_and_epicycle" title="wikilink">deferent and epicycle</a> model. Aristotle submits to the calculations of astronomers regarding the total number of spheres and various accounts give a number in the neighborhood of fifty spheres. An <a href="unmoved_mover" title="wikilink">unmoved mover</a> is assumed for each sphere, including a "prime mover" for the sphere of <a href="fixed_stars" title="wikilink">fixed stars</a>. The unmoved movers do not push the spheres (nor could they, being immaterial and dimensionless) but are the <a href="Four_causes" title="wikilink">final cause</a> of the spheres' motion, i.e. they explain it in a way that's similar to the explanation "the soul is moved by beauty".</p>
<h3 id="four-causes">Four causes</h3>

<p>According to Aristotle, there are four ways to explain the <em>aitia</em> or causes of change. He writes that "we do not have knowledge of a thing until we have grasped its why, that is to say, its cause."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>Aristotle held that there were four kinds of causes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="material">Material</h4>

<p>The material cause of a thing is that of which it is made. For a table, that might be wood; for a statue, that might be bronze or marble. <mtpl></mtpl></p>
<h4 id="formal">Formal</h4>

<p>The formal cause of a thing is the <a href="Essence" title="wikilink">essential</a> property that makes it the <a href="Substance_theory" title="wikilink">kind of thing</a> it is. In <em><a href="Metaphysics_(Aristotle)" title="wikilink">Metaphysics</a></em> Book Α Aristotle emphasizes that form is closely related to <a href="Substance_theory" title="wikilink">essence and definition</a>. He says for example that the ratio 2:1, and number in general, is the cause of the <a class="uri" href="octave" title="wikilink">octave</a>. <mtpl></mtpl></p>
<h4 id="efficient">Efficient</h4>

<p>The efficient cause of a thing is the primary agency by which its matter took its form. For example, the efficient cause of a baby is a parent of the same species and that of a table is a carpenter, who knows the form of the table. In his <em><a href="Physics_(Aristotle)" title="wikilink">Physics</a></em> II, 194b29—32, Aristotle writes: "there is that which is the primary originator of the change and of its cessation, such as the deliberator who is responsible [sc. for the action] and the father of the child, and in general the producer of the thing produced and the changer of the thing changed". </p>
<h4 id="final">Final</h4>

<p>The final cause is that for the sake of which something takes place, its aim or teleological purpose: for a germinating seed, it is the adult plant,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> for a ball at the top of a ramp, it is coming to rest at the bottom, for an eye, it is seeing, for a knife, it is cutting. </p>
<h3 id="biology">Biology</h3>

<p>According to Aristotle, the science of living things proceeds by gathering observations about each natural kind of animal, organizing them into <a href="Genus-differentia_definition" title="wikilink">genera and species</a> (the <em>differentiae</em> in <em><a href="History_of_Animals" title="wikilink">History of Animals</a></em>) and then going on to study the causes (in <em><a href="Parts_of_Animals" title="wikilink">Parts of Animals</a></em> and <em><a href="Generation_of_Animals" title="wikilink">Generation of Animals</a></em>, his three main biological works).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> <mtpl></mtpl></p>
<h4 id="organism-and-mechanism">Organism and mechanism</h4>

<p>The four elements make up the uniform materials such as blood, flesh and bone, which are themselves the matter out of which are created the non-uniform organs of the body (e.g. the heart, liver and hands) "which in turn, as parts, are matter for the functioning body as a whole (<em><a href="Parts_of_Animals" title="wikilink">PA</a></em> II. 1 646a 13—24)".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> <mtpl></mtpl> <em>See also <a href="Organic_Form" title="wikilink">Organic Form</a>.</em></p>
<h4 id="psychology">Psychology</h4>

<p>According to Aristotle, perception and thought are similar, though not exactly alike in that perception is concerned only with the external objects that are acting on our sense organs at any given time, whereas we can think about anything we choose. Thought is about <a href="Aristotle's_theory_of_universals" title="wikilink">universal forms</a>, in so far as they've been successfully understood, based on our memory of having encountered instances of those forms directly.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <mtpl></mtpl></p>
<h3 id="natural-place">Natural place</h3>

<p>The Aristotelian explanation of gravity is that all bodies move toward their natural place. For the elements earth and water, that place is the center of the (<a class="uri" href="geocentric" title="wikilink">geocentric</a>) universe;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> the natural place of water is a concentric shell around the earth because earth is heavier; it sinks in water. The natural place of air is likewise a concentric shell surrounding that of water; bubbles rise in water. Finally, the natural place of fire is higher than that of air but below the innermost celestial sphere (carrying the Moon).</p>

<p>In Book <em>Delta</em> of his <em>Physics</em> (IV.5), Aristotle defines <em>topos</em> (place) in terms of two bodies, one of which contains the other: a "place" is where the inner surface of the former (the containing body) touches the outer surface of the other (the contained body). This definition remained dominant until the beginning of the 17th century, even though it had been questioned and debated by philosophers since antiquity.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The most significant early critique was made in terms of geometry by the 11th-century Arab <a class="uri" href="polymath" title="wikilink">polymath</a> al-Hasan <a href="Ibn_al-Haytham" title="wikilink">Ibn al-Haytham</a> (<a class="uri" href="Alhazen" title="wikilink">Alhazen</a>) in his <em>Discourse on Place</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="natural-motion">Natural motion</h3>

<p>Terrestrial objects rise or fall, to a greater or lesser extent, according to the ratio of the four elements of which they are composed. For example, earth, the heaviest element, and water, fall toward the center of the cosmos; hence the Earth and for the most part its oceans, will have already come to rest there. At the opposite extreme, the lightest elements, air and especially fire, rise up and away from the center.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>The elements are not proper <em><a href="Substance_theory" title="wikilink">substances</a></em> in Aristotelian theory (or the modern sense of the word). Instead, they are <a href="abstraction" title="wikilink">abstractions</a> used to explain the varying natures and behaviors of actual materials in terms of ratios between them.</p>

<p>Motion and change are closely related in Aristotelian physics. Motion, according to Aristotle, involved a change from <a class="uri" href="potentiality" title="wikilink">potentiality</a> to <a class="uri" href="actuality" title="wikilink">actuality</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> He gave example of four types of change. Contrary to what is commonly believed, Aristotle taught that, if unopposed, an object set in motion will continue in that motion because there is no reason why it should stop.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> He may consequently be considered the originator of the law of inertia or "Newton's first law of motion".</p>

<p>Aristotle proposed that the speed at which two identically shaped objects sink or fall is <a href="directly_proportional" title="wikilink">directly proportional</a> to their weights and <a href="inversely_proportional" title="wikilink">inversely proportional</a> to the density of the medium through which they move.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> While describing their <a href="terminal_velocity" title="wikilink">terminal velocity</a>, Aristotle must stipulate that there would be no limit at which to compare the speed of atoms <a href="free_fall" title="wikilink">falling through a vacuum</a>, (they could move indefinitely fast because there would be no particular place for them to come to rest in the void). Now however it is understood that at any time prior to achieving terminal velocity in a relatively resistance-free medium like air, two such objects are expected to have nearly identical speeds because both are experiencing a force of gravity proportional to their masses and have thus been accelerating at nearly the same rate. This became especially apparent from the eighteenth century when <a href="partial_vacuum" title="wikilink">partial vacuum</a> experiments began to be made, but some two hundred years earlier <a class="uri" href="Galileo" title="wikilink">Galileo</a> had already demonstrated that objects of different weights reach the ground in similar times.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="unnatural-motion">Unnatural motion</h3>

<p>Apart from the natural tendency of terrestrial exhalations to <a href="Buoyancy" title="wikilink">rise</a> and objects to <a href="Gravity" title="wikilink">fall</a>, unnatural or <a href="force" title="wikilink">forced</a> motion from side to side results from the turbulent collision and sliding of the objects as well as <a href="Nuclear_transmutation" title="wikilink">transmutation</a> between the elements (<a href="On_Generation_and_Corruption" title="wikilink">On Generation and Corruption</a>).</p>
<h4 id="chance">Chance</h4>

<p>In his <em><a href="Physics_(Aristotle)" title="wikilink">Physics</a></em> Aristotle examines <a href="Accident_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">accidents</a> (συμβεβηκός, <em><a class="uri" href="sumbebekos" title="wikilink">sumbebekos</a></em>) that have no cause but chance. "Nor is there any definite cause for an accident, but only chance (τύχη, <em>tukhe</em>), namely an indefinite (ἀόριστον) cause" (<em><a href="Metaphysics_(Aristotle)" title="wikilink">Metaphysics</a></em> V, 1025a25).</p>
<blockquote>

<p><code>   It is obvious that there are principles and causes which are generable and destructible apart from the actual processes of generation and destruction; for if this is not true, everything will be of necessity: that is, if there must necessarily be some cause, other than accidental, of that which is generated and destroyed. Will this be, or not? Yes, if this happens; otherwise not (</code><em><a href="Metaphysics_(Aristotle)" title="wikilink"><code>Metaphysics</code></a></em><code> VI, 1027a29).</code></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="continuum-and-vacuum">Continuum and vacuum</h3>

<p>Aristotle argues against the indivisibles of <a class="uri" href="Democritus" title="wikilink">Democritus</a> (which differ considerably from the <a href="Corpuscularianism" title="wikilink">historical</a> and the <a href="Atomic_theory" title="wikilink">modern</a> use of the term "<a class="uri" href="atom" title="wikilink">atom</a>"). As a place without anything existing at or within it, Aristotle argued against the possibility of a vacuum or void. Because he believed that the speed of an object's motion is proportional to the force being applied (or, in the case of natural motion, the object's weight) and inversely proportional to the viscosity of the medium, he reasoned that objects moving in a void would move indefinitely fastand thus any and all objects surrounding the void would immediately fill it. The void, therefore, could never form.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>The "<a href="Void_(astronomy)" title="wikilink">voids</a>" of modern-day astronomy (such as the <a href="Local_Void" title="wikilink">Local Void</a> adjacent to <a href="Milky_Way" title="wikilink">our own galaxy</a>) have the opposite effect: ultimately, bodies off-center are ejected from the void due to the gravity of the material outside.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="speed-weight-and-resistance">Speed, weight and resistance</h3>

<p>The ideal speed of a terrestrial object is <a href="directly_proportional" title="wikilink">directly proportional</a> to its weight. In nature however, <a class="uri" href="vacuum" title="wikilink">vacuum</a> does not occur, the matter obstructing an object's path is a limiting factor that is <a href="inversely_proportional" title="wikilink">inversely proportional</a> to the <a class="uri" href="viscosity" title="wikilink">viscosity</a> of the medium.</p>
<h2 id="medieval-commentary">Medieval commentary</h2>

<p>The Aristotelian theory of motion came under criticism and modification during the <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a>. Modifications began with <a href="John_Philoponus" title="wikilink">John Philoponus</a> in the 6th century, who partly accepted Aristotle's theory that "continuation of motion depends on continued action of a force" but modified it to include his idea that a hurled body also acquires an inclination (or "motive power") for movement away from whatever caused it to move, an inclination that secures its continued motion. This impressed virtue would be temporary and self-expending, meaning that all motion would tend toward the form of Aristotle's natural motion.</p>

<p>In <em><a href="The_Book_of_Healing" title="wikilink">The Book of Healing</a></em> (1027), the 11th-century <a href="Persia" title="wikilink">Persian</a> polymath <a class="uri" href="Avicenna" title="wikilink">Avicenna</a> developed Philoponean theory into the first coherent alternative to Aristotelian theory. Inclinations in the <a href="Avicennism" title="wikilink">Avicennan</a> theory of motion were not self-consuming but permanent forces whose effects were dissipated only as a result of external agents such as air resistance, making him "the first to conceive such a permanent type of impressed virtue for non-natural motion". Such a self-motion (<em>mayl</em>) is "almost the opposite of the Aristotelian conception of violent motion of the projectile type, and it is rather reminiscent of the principle of <a class="uri" href="inertia" title="wikilink">inertia</a>, i.e. <a href="Newton's_first_law_of_motion" title="wikilink">Newton's first law of motion</a>."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>The eldest <a href="Banū_Mūsā" title="wikilink">Banū Mūsā</a> brother, Ja'far Muhammad ibn Mūsā ibn Shākir (800-873), wrote the <em>Astral Motion</em> and <em>The Force of Attraction</em>. The Persian physicist, <a href="Ibn_al-Haytham" title="wikilink">Ibn al-Haytham</a> (965-1039) discussed the theory of attraction between bodies. It seems that he was aware of the <a href="Magnitude_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">magnitude</a> of <a class="uri" href="acceleration" title="wikilink">acceleration</a> due to <a class="uri" href="gravity" title="wikilink">gravity</a> and he discovered that the heavenly bodies "were accountable to the <a href="Physical_law" title="wikilink">laws of physics</a>".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The Persian polymath <a href="Abū_Rayhān_al-Bīrūnī" title="wikilink">Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī</a> (973-1048) was the first to realize that <a class="uri" href="acceleration" title="wikilink">acceleration</a> is connected with non-uniform motion (as later expressed by <a href="Newton's_second_law_of_motion" title="wikilink">Newton's second law of motion</a>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> During his debate with <a class="uri" href="Avicenna" title="wikilink">Avicenna</a>, al-Biruni also criticized the Aristotelian theory of gravity firstly for denying the existence of <a href="wiktionary:levity" title="wikilink">levity</a> or gravity in the <a href="celestial_sphere" title="wikilink">celestial spheres</a>; and, secondly, for its notion of <a href="circular_motion" title="wikilink">circular motion</a> being an <a href="Intrinsic_and_extrinsic_properties" title="wikilink">innate property</a> of the <a href="Astronomical_object" title="wikilink">heavenly bodies</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1121, <a class="uri" href="al-Khazini" title="wikilink">al-Khazini</a>, in <em>The Book of the Balance of Wisdom</em>, proposed that the gravity and <a href="gravitational_potential_energy" title="wikilink">gravitational potential energy</a> of a body varies depending on its distance from the centre of the Earth.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> <a href="Hibat_Allah_Abu'l-Barakat_al-Baghdaadi" title="wikilink">Hibat Allah Abu'l-Barakat al-Baghdaadi</a> (1080–1165) wrote <em>al-Mu'tabar</em>, a critique of Aristotelian physics where he negated Aristotle's idea that a constant <a class="uri" href="force" title="wikilink">force</a> produces uniform motion, as he realized that a force applied continuously produces <a class="uri" href="acceleration" title="wikilink">acceleration</a>, a fundamental law of <a href="classical_mechanics" title="wikilink">classical mechanics</a> and an early foreshadowing of <a href="Newton's_second_law_of_motion" title="wikilink">Newton's second law of motion</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Like Newton, he described acceleration as the rate of change of <a class="uri" href="speed" title="wikilink">speed</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p>In the 14th century, <a href="Jean_Buridan" title="wikilink">Jean Buridan</a> developed the <a href="theory_of_impetus" title="wikilink">theory of impetus</a> as an alternative to the Aristotelian theory of motion.

<p>The reign of Aristotelian physics, the earliest known speculative theory of physics, lasted almost two millennia. After the work of many pioneers such as <a class="uri" href="Copernicus" title="wikilink">Copernicus</a>, <a class="uri" href="Galileo" title="wikilink">Galileo</a>, <a class="uri" href="Descartes" title="wikilink">Descartes</a> and <a href="Isaac_Newton" title="wikilink">Newton</a>, it became generally accepted that Aristotelian physics was neither correct nor viable.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Despite this, it survived as a scholastic pursuit well into the seventeenth century, until universities amended their curricula.</p>

<p>In Europe, Aristotle's theory was first convincingly discredited by Galileo's studies. Using a <a class="uri" href="telescope" title="wikilink">telescope</a>, Galileo observed that the Moon was not entirely smooth, but had craters and mountains, contradicting the Aristotelian idea of the incorruptibly perfect smooth Moon. Galileo also criticized this notion theoretically; a perfectly smooth Moon would reflect light unevenly like a shiny <a href="billiard_ball" title="wikilink">billiard ball</a>, so that the edges of the moon's disk would have a different brightness than the point where a tangent plane reflects sunlight directly to the eye. A rough moon reflects in all directions equally, leading to a disk of approximately equal brightness which is what is observed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Galileo also observed that <a class="uri" href="Jupiter" title="wikilink">Jupiter</a> has <a href="Galilean_moons" title="wikilink">moons</a>i.e. objects revolving around a body other than the Earthand noted the <a href="Planetary_phase" title="wikilink">phases</a> of Venus, which demonstrated that Venus (and, by implication, Mercury) traveled around the Sun, not the Earth.</p>

<p>According to legend, Galileo dropped balls of various <a href="Density" title="wikilink">densities</a> from the <a href="Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa" title="wikilink">Tower of Pisa</a> and found that lighter and heavier ones fell at almost the same speed. His experiments actually took place using balls rolling down inclined planes, a form of falling sufficiently slow to be measured without advanced instruments.</p>

<p>In a relatively dense medium such as water, a heavier body falls faster than a lighter one. This led Aristotle to speculate that the rate of falling is proportional to the weight and inversely proportional to the density of the medium. From his experience with objects falling in water, he concluded that water is approximately ten times denser than air. By weighing a volume of compressed air, Galileo showed that this overestimates the density of air by a factor of forty.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> From his experiments with inclined planes, he concluded that if <a class="uri" href="friction" title="wikilink">friction</a> is neglected, all bodies fall at the same rate.</p>

<p>Galileo also advanced a theoretical argument to support his conclusion. He asked if two bodies of different weights and different rates of fall are tied by a string, does the combined system fall faster because it is now more massive, or does the lighter body in its slower fall hold back the heavier body? The only convincing answer is neither: all the systems fall at the same rate.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p>Followers of Aristotle were aware that the motion of falling bodies was not uniform, but picked up speed with time. Since time is an abstract quantity, the <a href="Peripatetic_school" title="wikilink">peripatetics</a> postulated that the speed was proportional to the distance. Galileo established experimentally that the speed is proportional to the time, but he also gave a theoretical argument that the speed could not possibly be proportional to the distance. In modern terms, if the rate of fall is proportional to the distance, the differential equation for the distance y travelled after time t is:</p>
