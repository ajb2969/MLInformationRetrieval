<h1>Diamond v. Diehr</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong><em>Diamond v. Diehr</em></strong>, , was a <a href="Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">United States Supreme Court</a> decision which held that controlling the execution of a physical process, by running a <a href="computer_program" title="wikilink">computer program</a> did not preclude <a class="uri" href="patentability" title="wikilink">patentability</a> of the invention as a whole. The high court reiterated its earlier holdings that mathematical formulas in the abstract could not be patented, but it held that the mere presence of a software element did not make an otherwise patent-eligible machine or process patent ineligible. <em>Diehr</em> was the third member of a trilogy of Supreme Court decisions on the patent-eligibility of computer software related inventions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>it is possible to calculate when to open the press and to remove the cured, molded rubber. The problem was that there was, at the time the invention was made, no disclosed way to obtain an accurate measure of the temperature without opening the press.</p>

<p>The invention solved this problem by using embedded thermocouples to constantly check the temperature, and then feeding the measured values into a computer. The computer then used the Arrhenius equation to calculate when sufficient energy had been absorbed so that the molding machine should open the press.</p>
<h3 id="the-claims">The claims</h3>

<p>Independent claim 1 of the allowed patent is representative. It provides:</p>

<p>1. A method of operating a rubber-molding press for precision molded compounds with the aid of a digital computer, comprising:</p>
<ul>
<li>providing said computer with a data base for said press including at least, natural logarithm conversion data (ln), the activation energy constant (C) unique to each batch of said compound being molded, and a constant (x) dependent upon the geometry of the particular mold of the press,</li>
<li>initiating an interval timer in said computer upon the closure of the press for monitoring the elapsed time of said closure,</li>
<li>constantly determining the temperature (Z) of the mold at a location closely adjacent to the mold cavity in the press during molding,</li>
<li>constantly providing the computer with the temperature (Z),</li>
<li>repetitively performing in the computer, at frequent intervals during each cure, integrations to calculate from the series of temperature determinations the Arrhenius equation for reaction time during the cure, which is</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd>ln(v)=CZ+x
</dd>
<dd>where v is the total required cure time,
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>repetitively comparing in the computer at frequent intervals during the cure each said calculation of the total required cure time calculated with the Arrhenius equation and said elapsed time, and</li>
<li>opening the press automatically when a said comparison indicates completion of curing.''</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="proceedings-before-office-and-ccpa">Proceedings before Office and CCPA</h3>

<p>The <a href="patent_examiner" title="wikilink">patent examiner</a> rejected this invention as unpatentable subject matter under 35 U.S.C. 101. He argued that the steps performed by the computer were unpatentable as a computer program under <em><a href="Gottschalk_v._Benson" title="wikilink">Gottschalk v. Benson</a></em>, 409 U.S. 63 (1972). The <a href="Board_of_Patent_Appeals_and_Interferences" title="wikilink">Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences</a> of the <a href="United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office" title="wikilink">USPTO</a> affirmed the rejection. The <a href="United_States_Court_of_Customs_and_Patent_Appeals" title="wikilink">Court of Customs and Patent Appeals</a> (CCPA), the predecessor to the current <a href="United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Federal_Circuit" title="wikilink">Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a>, reversed, noting that an otherwise patentable invention did not become unpatentable simply because a <a class="uri" href="computer" title="wikilink">computer</a> was involved.</p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court granted the petition for <a class="uri" href="certiorari" title="wikilink">certiorari</a> by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to resolve this question.</p>
<h2 id="the-supreme-courts-opinion">The Supreme Court's opinion</h2>

<p>The Court repeated its earlier holding that mathematical formulas in the abstract are not eligible for patent protection. But it also held that a physical machine or process which makes use of a mathematical <a class="uri" href="algorithm" title="wikilink">algorithm</a> is different from an invention which claims the algorithm, as such, in the abstract. Thus, if the invention as a whole meets the requirements of patentability—that is, it involves "transforming or reducing an article to a different state or thing"—it is patent-eligible, even if it includes a software component.</p>

<p>The CCPA's reversal of the patent rejection was affirmed. But the Court carefully avoided overruling <em>Benson</em> or <em>Flook</em>. It did criticize the analytic methodology of <em>Flook</em>, however, by challenging its use of <a href="analytic_dissection" title="wikilink">analytic dissection</a>, which the <em>Flook</em> Court based on <em><a href="Neilson_v._Harford" title="wikilink">Neilson v. Harford</a></em>. The <em>Diehr</em> Court said, without citation of any supporting authority, that under section 101 the invention had to be considered as a whole.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-patent">The patent</h2>

<p>The patent that issued after the decision was <a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4344142.html">U.S.Pat. No. 4,344,142</a>, "Direct digital control of rubber molding presses." The patent includes 11 method claims, three of which are independent. All method claims relate to molding of physical articles. The only diagrams in the patent are flowcharts. There are no diagrams of machinery. As the dissenting opinion in <em>Diehr</em> noted, the patent specification "teaches nothing about the chemistry of the synthetic rubber-curing process, nothing about the raw materials to be used in curing synthetic rubber, nothing about the equipment to be used in the process, and nothing about the significance or effect of any process variable such as temperature, curing time, particular compositions of material, or mold configurations."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="subsequent-developments">Subsequent developments</h2>

<p>For many years, it was believed that <em>Diehr</em> effectively overruled <em>Flook</em>, despite the majority opinion's avoiding any such statement.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>In 2012, in <em><a href="Mayo_v._Prometheus" title="wikilink">Mayo v. Prometheus</a></em>, the unanimous opinion of the Supreme Court interpreted <em>Diehr</em> so as to harmonize it with <em>Flook</em>. The Court "found the overall process patent eligible because of the way the additional steps of the process [besides the equation] integrated the equation into the process as a whole."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The Court "nowhere suggested that all these steps, or at least the combination of those steps, were in context obvious, already in use, or purely conventional."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> "These other steps apparently added to the formula something that in terms of patent law’s objectives had significance—they transformed the process into an inventive application of the formula."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>The Court interpreted <em>Diehr</em> slightly differently in <em><a href="Alice_v._CLS_Bank" title="wikilink">Alice v. CLS Bank</a></em>, another unanimous opinion, but without taking issue with the <em>Mayo</em> interpretation. The <em>Alice</em> Court said:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>In <em>Diehr</em>, by contrast [with <em>Flook</em>], we held that a computer-implemented process for curing rubber was patent eligible, but not because it involved a computer. The claim employed a "well-known" mathematical equation, but it used that equation in a process designed to solve a technological problem in "conventional industry practice." The invention in <em>Diehr</em> used a "thermocouple" to record constant temperature measurements inside the rubber mold — something "the industry ha[d] not been able to obtain." The temperature measurements were then fed into a computer, which repeatedly recalculated the remaining cure time by using the mathematical equation. These additional steps, we recently explained, "transformed the process into an inventive application of the formula." <em>Mayo</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___, 132 S.Ct., at 1299. In other words, the claims in <em>Diehr</em> were patent eligible because they improved an existing technological process, not because they were implemented on a computer.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These two opinions state the current Supreme Court interpretation of what the <em>Diehr</em> case holds.</p>
