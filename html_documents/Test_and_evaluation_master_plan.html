<h1>Test and evaluation master plan</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Test and Evaluation Master Plan</strong> (TEMP) is a critical aspect of <a href="project_management" title="wikilink">project management</a> involving complex systems that must satisfy specification requirements. The TEMP is used to support programmatic events called milestone decisions that separate the individual phases of a project. For military systems, the level of funding determines the Acquisition Category and the organization responsible for the milestone decision.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>A <a href="traceability_matrix" title="wikilink">traceability matrix</a> is generally used to link items within the TEMP to items within <a href="Specification_(technical_standard)" title="wikilink">specifications</a>.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>

<p>The Test and Evaluation Master Plan consists of individual tests. Each test contains the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Test Scenario</li>
<li>Data Collection</li>
<li>Performance Evaluation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="test-scenario">Test Scenario</h3>

<p>The <em>Test Scenario</em> establishes test conditions. This is typically associated with a specific mission profile. For military systems, this would be a combat scenario, and it may involve Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E;). For commercial systems, this would involve a specific kind of situation involving the use of the item being developed.</p>

<p>For example, cold weather operation may require operation to be evaluated at temperatures below

C using an environmental chamber. Evaluation of operation with a vehicle interface may require compatibility evaluation with a <a href="Vibration#Vibration_testing" title="wikilink">vibration test</a>. Evaluation of an Internet store would require the system to take the user through a product purchase while the system is loaded with other traffic.</p>

<p>The test scenario identifies the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Items required for testing</li>
<li>Instructions to set up the items that will be used during the test</li>
<li>General description for how to operate the system under test</li>
<li>Specific actions and events that will take place during the test</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h3>

<p><em>Data Collection</em> identifies information that must be collected during the test. This involves preliminary setup before the test begins. This may involve preparation for any of the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Settings for the system under test</li>
<li>Separate instrumentation</li>
<li>Written notes from direct observation</li>
<li>Sample collection</li>
</ul>

<p>Systems that incorporate a computer typically require the ability to extract and record specific kinds of data from the system while it is operating normally.</p>

<p>Electronic data collection may be started and stopped as one of the actions described in the test scenario.</p>

<p>When data access is restricted, so the transfer of data between organizations may require a <em>Data Collection Plan</em>. This can occur with <a href="Classified_information" title="wikilink">classified military systems</a>.</p>

<p>Data is analyzed after testing is complete. This analysis is called performance evaluation.</p>
<h3 id="performance-evaluation">Performance Evaluation</h3>
<h4 id="measures-of-effectiveness">Measures of Effectiveness</h4>

<p><strong>Measures of Effectiveness</strong> are specific metrics that are used to measure results in the overall mission and execution of assigned tasks.</p>

<p>These may have flexible performance limits associated with the outcome of a specific event. For example, the first round fired from a gun aimed using a radar would not impact a specific location, but the position can be measured using the radar, so the system should be able to deliver a round within a specific radius after several rounds have been fired. The number of rounds required to land one inside the limit is the MOE. The radius would be a Measure Of Performance (MOP).</p>
<h4 id="measures-of-performance">Measures of Performance</h4>

<p><strong>Measures of Performance</strong> are specific metrics that have a pass or fail limit that must be satisfied. These are generally identified with the words <em>shall</em> or <em>must</em> in the specification.</p>

<p>One type of MOP is the distance that a vehicle with a specific load must travel at a specific speed before running out of fuel.</p>

<p>Another type of MOP is the distance that a radar can detect a 1 square meter reflector.</p>
<h4 id="measures-of-suitability">Measures of Suitability</h4>

<p><strong>Measures of Suitability</strong> evaluate the ability to be supported in its intended operational environment.</p>

<p>As an example, this may be an evaluation of the Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) that is evaluated during other testing. A system with excessive failures may satisfy all other requirements and not be suitable for use. A gun that jams when dirty is not suitable for military use.</p>

<p>These requirements are associated with ilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reliability</li>
<li>Availability</li>
<li>Maintainability</li>
<li>Supportability</li>
<li>Usability</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>The results of the TEMP evaluation are used for multiple purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rejection: funding termination decision</li>
<li>Redesign: modification and re-test funding decision</li>
<li>Full rate production: acceptance funding decision</li>
<li>Mission planning</li>
</ul>

<p>Mission planning involves translation of MOEs, MOPs, and MOSs into the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Required Operational Capability (ROC)</li>
<li>Projected Operational Environment (POE)</li>
<li>Diagnostic Testing via <a href="Built-in_self-test" title="wikilink">Built-In Test</a> (BIT) or <a href="Planned_Maintenance" title="wikilink">Planned Maintenance</a></li>
</ul>

<p>ROC and POE are specific expectations evaluated by the TEMP that are used to determine how to deploy assets to satisfy a specific mission requirement. Diagnostic testing ensures these expectations are satisfied for the duration of the mission.</p>
