<h1>Francis Birch (geophysicist)</h1>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Francis Birch</strong> (August 22, 1903 – January 30, 1992) was an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a class="uri" href="geophysicist" title="wikilink">geophysicist</a>. He is considered one of the founders of solid Earth <a class="uri" href="geophysics" title="wikilink">geophysics</a>. He is also known for his part in the <a href="atomic_bombing_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki" title="wikilink">atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a>.</p>
<p>During <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, Birch participated in the <a href="Manhattan_Project" title="wikilink">Manhattan Project</a>, working on the design and development of the <a href="gun-type_nuclear_weapon" title="wikilink">gun-type nuclear weapon</a> known as <a href="Little_Boy" title="wikilink">Little Boy</a>. He oversaw its manufacture, and went to <a class="uri" href="Tinian" title="wikilink">Tinian</a> to supervise its assembly and loading into <em><a href="Enola_Gay" title="wikilink">Enola Gay</a></em>, the <a href="Boeing_B-29_Superfortress" title="wikilink">Boeing B-29 Superfortress</a> tasked with dropping the bomb.</p>
<p>A graduate of <a href="Harvard_University" title="wikilink">Harvard University</a>, Birch began working on <a class="uri" href="geophysics" title="wikilink">geophysics</a> as a research assistant. He subsequently spent his entire career at Harvard working in the field, becoming an Associate Professor of Geology in 1943, a professor in 1946, and Sturgis Hooper Professor of Geology in 1949, and <a href="professor_emeritus" title="wikilink">professor emeritus</a> in 1974.</p>
<p>Birch published over 100 papers. He developed what is now known as the <a href="Birch-Murnaghan_equation_of_state" title="wikilink">Birch-Murnaghan equation of state</a> in 1947. In 1952 he demonstrated that Earth's <a href="Mantle_(geology)" title="wikilink">mantle</a> is chiefly composed of <a href="silicate_minerals" title="wikilink">silicate minerals</a>, with an <a href="inner_core" title="wikilink">inner</a> and <a href="outer_core" title="wikilink">outer</a> core of molten <a class="uri" href="iron" title="wikilink">iron</a>. In two 1961 papers on <a href="compressional_wave" title="wikilink">compressional wave</a> velocities, he established what is now called <a href="Birch's_law" title="wikilink">Birch's law</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p><strong>Albert Francis Birch</strong> was born in Washington, D.C., on August 22, 1903, the son of George Albert Birch, who was involved in banking and real estate, and Mary Hemmick Birch, a church choir singer and soloist at <a href="Cathedral_of_St._Matthew_the_Apostle_(Washington,_D.C.)" title="wikilink">St. Matthew's Cathedral</a> in Washington, D.C. He had three younger brothers: David, who became a banker; John, who became a diplomat; and Robert, who became a song writer. He was educated at Washington, D.C., schools, and <a href="Duke_Ellington_School_of_the_Arts" title="wikilink">Western High School</a>, where he joined the <a href="Junior_Reserve_Officers'_Training_Corps" title="wikilink">High School Cadets</a> in 1916.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1920 Birch entered <a href="Harvard_University" title="wikilink">Harvard University</a> on a scholarship. While there he served in Harvard's <a href="Reserve_Officers'_Training_Corps" title="wikilink">Reserve Officers' Training Corps</a> Field Artillery Battalion. He graduated <a href="magna_cum_laude" title="wikilink">magna cum laude</a> in 1924, and received his <a href="bachelor_of_science" title="wikilink">bachelor of science</a> (S.B.) degree in <a href="electrical_engineering" title="wikilink">electrical engineering</a>.</p>
<p>Birch went to work in the Engineering Department of the <a href="New_York_Telephone_Company" title="wikilink">New York Telephone Company</a>. He applied for and received an <a href="AFS_Intercultural_Programs" title="wikilink">American Field Service</a> Fellowship in 1926, which he used to travel to <a class="uri" href="Strasbourg" title="wikilink">Strasbourg</a>, and study at the <a href="University_of_Strasbourg" title="wikilink">University of Strasbourg</a>'s Institut de Physique under the tutelage of <a href="Pierre_Weiss" title="wikilink">Pierre Weiss</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> There, he wrote or co-wrote four papers, in French, on topics such as the <a class="uri" href="paramagnetic" title="wikilink">paramagnetic</a> properties of <a href="potassium_cyanide" title="wikilink">potassium cyanide</a>, and the <a href="magnetic_moment" title="wikilink">magnetic moment</a> of Cu++ ions.</p>
<p>On returning to the United States in 1928, Birch went back to Harvard to pursue physics. He was awarded his <a href="master_of_arts" title="wikilink">master of arts</a> (A.M.) degree in 1929, and then commenced work on his 1932 <a href="doctor_of_philosophy" title="wikilink">doctor of philosophy</a> (Ph.D.) degree under the supervision of <a href="Percy_Bridgman" title="wikilink">Percy Bridgman</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> who would receive the <a href="Nobel_Prize_for_Physics" title="wikilink">Nobel Prize for Physics</a> in 1946. For his thesis, Birch measured the <a href="Critical_point_(thermodynamics)" title="wikilink">vapor-liquid critical point</a> of <a href="Mercury_(element)" title="wikilink">mercury</a>. He determined this as 1460±20 °C and 1640±50 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>, results he published in 1932 in the <a href="Physical_Review" title="wikilink">Physical Review</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Around this time, there was an increased interest in geophysics at Harvard University, and <a href="Reginald_Aldworth_Daly" title="wikilink">Reginald Aldworth Daly</a> established a Committee for Experimental Geology and Geophysics that included Bridgman, astronomer <a href="Harlow_Shapely" title="wikilink">Harlow Shapely</a>, geologists <a href="Louis_Caryl_Graton" title="wikilink">Louis Caryl Graton</a> and D. H. McLaughlin and chemist G. P. Baxter. <a href="William_Zisman" title="wikilink">William Zisman</a>, another one of Bridgman's Ph.D. students, was hired as the committee's research associate, but, having little interest in the study of rocks, he resigned in 1932. The position was then offered to Birch, who had little interest or experience in geology either, but with the advent of the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a>, jobs were hard to find, and he accepted. <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>On July 15, 1933, Birch married Barbara Channing, a <a href="Bryn_Mawr_College" title="wikilink">Bryn Mawr College</a> alumna, and a <a href="collateral_descendant" title="wikilink">collateral descendant</a> of the theologian <a href="William_Ellery_Channing" title="wikilink">William Ellery Channing</a>. They had three children: Anne Campaspe, Francis (Frank) Sylvanus and Mary Narcissa. Frank later became a professor of geophysics at the <a href="University_of_New_Hampshire" title="wikilink">University of New Hampshire</a>.</p>
<h2 id="world-war-ii">World War II</h2>
<p> In 1942, during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, Birch took a leave of absence from Harvard, in order to work at the <a href="Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="wikilink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> <a href="Radiation_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Radiation Laboratory</a>, which was developing <a class="uri" href="radar" title="wikilink">radar</a>. He worked on the <a href="proximity_fuze" title="wikilink">proximity fuze</a>, a radar-triggered fuze that would explode a shell in the proximity of a target. The following year he accepted a commission in the United States Navy as a <a href="lieutenant_commander" title="wikilink">lieutenant commander</a>, and was posted to the <a href="Bureau_of_Ships" title="wikilink">Bureau of Ships</a> in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Later that year he was assigned to the <a href="Manhattan_Project" title="wikilink">Manhattan Project</a>, and moved with his family to <a href="Los_Alamos,_New_Mexico" title="wikilink">Los Alamos, New Mexico</a>. There he joined the <a href="Los_Alamos_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Los Alamos Laboratory</a>'s Ordnance (O) Division, which was under the command of another Naval officer, <a href="Captain_(United_States_Navy)" title="wikilink">Captain</a> <a href="William_S._Parsons" title="wikilink">William S. Parsons</a>. Initially the goal of the O Division was to design a <a href="gun-type_nuclear_weapon" title="wikilink">gun-type nuclear weapon</a> known as <a href="Thin_Man_(nuclear_bomb)" title="wikilink">Thin Man</a>. This proved to be impractical due to contamination of the reactor-bred <a class="uri" href="plutonium" title="wikilink">plutonium</a> with <a class="uri" href="plutonium-240" title="wikilink">plutonium-240</a>, and in February 1944, the Division switched its attention to the development of the <a href="Little_Boy" title="wikilink">Little Boy</a>, a smaller device using <a class="uri" href="uranium-235" title="wikilink">uranium-235</a>. Birch used unenriched uranium to create scale models and later full-scale mock-ups of the device.</p>
<p>Birch supervised the manufacture of the Little Boy, and went to Tinian to supervise its assembly and loading it onto <em><a href="Enola_Gay" title="wikilink">Enola Gay</a></em>, the <a href="Boeing_B-29_Superfortress" title="wikilink">Boeing B-29 Superfortress</a> tasked with dropping the bomb. He devised the 'double plug' system that allowed for actually arming the bomb after <em>Enola Gay</em> took off so that if it crashed, there would not be a nuclear explosion. He was awarded the <a href="Legion_of_Merit" title="wikilink">Legion of Merit</a>. His citation read:<mtpl></mtpl></p>
<h2 id="post-war">Post-war</h2>
<p>Birch returned to Harvard after the war ended, having been promoted to Associate Professor of Geology in 1943 while he was away. He would remain at Harvard for the rest of his career, becoming a professor in 1946, and Sturgis Hooper Professor of Geology in 1949, and <a href="professor_emeritus" title="wikilink">professor emeritus</a> in 1974. Professor Birch published over 100 papers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1947, he adapted the isothermal Murnaghan equation of state, which had been developed for infinitesimal strain, for <a class="uri" href="Eulerian" title="wikilink">Eulerian</a> finite strain, developing what is now known as the <a href="Birch-Murnaghan_equation_of_state" title="wikilink">Birch-Murnaghan equation of state</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Albert Francis Birch is known for his experimental work on the properties of Earth-forming <a class="uri" href="minerals" title="wikilink">minerals</a> at high pressure and temperature, in 1952 he published a well-known paper in the <a href="Journal_of_Geophysical_Research" title="wikilink">Journal of Geophysical Research</a>, where he demonstrated that the <a href="Mantle_(geology)" title="wikilink">mantle</a> is chiefly composed of <a href="silicate_minerals" title="wikilink">silicate minerals</a>, the upper and lower mantle are separated by a thin transition zone associated with silicate <a href="phase_transitions" title="wikilink">phase transitions</a>, and the <a href="inner_core" title="wikilink">inner</a> and <a href="outer_core" title="wikilink">outer</a> core are alloys of crystalline and molten <a class="uri" href="iron" title="wikilink">iron</a>. His conclusions are still accepted as correct today. The most famous portion of the paper, however, is a humorous footnote he included in the introduction:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
