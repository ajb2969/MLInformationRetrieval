<h1>Compositional data</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In <a class="uri" href="statistics" title="wikilink">statistics</a>, <strong>compositional data</strong> are quantitative descriptions of the parts of some whole, conveying exclusively relative information.</p>
<p>This definition, given by <a href="John_Aitchison" title="wikilink">John Aitchison</a> (1986) has several consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>A compositional data point, or <strong>composition</strong> for short, can be represented by a positive real vector with as many parts as considered. Sometimes, if the total amount is fixed and known, one component of the vector can be omitted.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As compositions only carry relative information, the only information is given by the ratios between components. Consequently, a composition multiplied by any positive constant contains the same information as the former. Therefore, proportional positive vectors are equivalent when considered as compositions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As usual in mathematics, equivalent classes are represented by some element of the class, called a representative. Thus, equivalent compositions can be represented by positive vectors whose components add to a given constant <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle\kappa$</span>. The vector operation assigning the constant sum representative is called <strong>closure</strong> and is denoted by <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle\mathcal{C}[\cdot]$</span>:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$\mathcal{C}[x_1,x_2,\dots,x_D]=\left[\frac{x_1}{\sum_{i=1}^D x_i},\frac{x_2}{\sum_{i=1}^D x_i}, \dots,\frac{x_D}{\sum_{i=1}^D x_i}\right],\$</span>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>where <em>D</em> is the number of parts (components) and <span class="LaTeX">$[\cdot]$</span> denotes a row vector.</p>
<ul>
<li>Compositional data can be represented by constant sum real vectors with positive components, and this vectors span a <strong><a class="uri" href="simplex" title="wikilink">simplex</a></strong>, defined as</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$\mathcal{S}^D=\left\{\mathbf{x}=[x_1,x_2,\dots,x_D]\in\mathbb{R}^D \left| x_i>0,i=1,2,\dots,D; \sum_{i=1}^D x_i=\kappa \right. \right\}. \$</span>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is the reason why <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle\mathcal{S}^D$</span> is considered to be the sample space of compositional data. The positive constant <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle\kappa$</span> is arbitrary. Frequent values for <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle\kappa$</span> are 1 (per unit), 100 (percent, %), 1000, 10<sup>6</sup> (ppm), 10<sup>9</sup> (ppb), ...</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a class="uri" href="statistics" title="wikilink">statistics</a>, compositional data is frequently considered to be data in which each <a href="data_point" title="wikilink">data point</a> is an <em>D</em>-tuple of nonnegative numbers whose sum is 1. Typically each of the <em>D</em> components <em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> of each data point [<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, ..., <em>x</em><sub><em>D</em></sub>] says what proportion (or "percentage") of a statistical unit falls into the <em>i</em>th category in a list of <em>D</em> categories. Very often <a href="ternary_plot" title="wikilink">ternary plots</a> are used in analysis of compositional data to represent a three part composition.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>An alternative nomenclature for <strong>compositional analysis</strong> is <em>simplicial analysis</em>, motivated by the concept of <a href="simplicial_set" title="wikilink">simplicial sets</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remarks on the definition of the simplex:</p>
<ul>
<li>In mathematical frameworks, the superscript of <span class="LaTeX">$\scriptstyle\mathcal{S}^D$</span>, accounting for the number of parts, is often changed to <em>D</em> − 1, describing the dimension.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The components of the vector are assumed to be positive. However, in some definitions of the simplex, non-negative components are admitted. Here null components are avoided, because ratios between components of which some are zero are meaningless.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each data point may correspond to a rock composed of three different minerals; a rock of which 10% is the first mineral, 30% is the second, and the remaining 60% is the third would correspond to the triple [0.1, 0.3, 0.6]; a <a href="data_set" title="wikilink">data set</a> would contain one such triple for each rock in a sample of rocks.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Each data point may correspond to a town; a town in which 35% of the people are Christians, 55% are Muslims, 6% are Jews, and the remaining 4% are others would correspond to the quadruple [0.35, 0.55, 0.06, 0.04]; a data set would correspond to a list of towns.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In chemistry, compositions can be expressed as molar concentrations of each component. As the sum of all concentrations is not determined, the whole composition of <em>D</em> parts is needed and thus expressed as a vector of <em>D</em> molar concentrations. These compositions can be translated into weight per cent multiplying each component by the appropriated constant.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In a survey, the proportions of people positively answering some different items can be expressed as percentages. As the total amount is identified as 100, the compositional vector of <em>D</em> components can be defined using only <em>D</em> − 1 components, assuming that the remaining component is the percentage needed for the whole vector to add to 100.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In probability and statistics, a partition of the sampling space into disjoint events is described by the probabilities assigned to such events. The vector of <em>D</em> probabilities can be considered as a composition of <em>D</em> parts. As they add to one, one probability can be suppressed and the composition is completely determined.</li>
