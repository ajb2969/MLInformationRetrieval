<h1>Laning and Zierler system</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>Laning and Zierler system</strong> (sometimes called "George" by its users) was one of the first operating algebraic <a href="compiler" title="wikilink">compilers</a>, that is, a system capable of accepting mathematical formulae in <a href="Infix_notation" title="wikilink">algebraic notation</a> and producing equivalent <a href="machine_code" title="wikilink">machine code</a> (the term compiler had not yet been invented and the system was referred to as "an <a href="interpreter" title="wikilink">interpretive</a> program"). It was implemented in 1954 for the <a href="Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="wikilink">MIT</a> <a href="Whirlwind_(computer)" title="wikilink">WHIRLWIND</a> by <a href="J._Halcombe_Laning" title="wikilink">J. Halcombe Laning</a> and Neal Zierler. It is preceded by the <a class="uri" href="UNIVAC" title="wikilink">UNIVAC</a> A-2, <a class="uri" href="IBM" title="wikilink">IBM</a> <a class="uri" href="Speedcoding" title="wikilink">Speedcoding</a> and a number of systems that were proposed but never implemented.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>The system accepted formulae in a more or less algebraic notation. It respected the standard rules for <a href="operator_precedence" title="wikilink">operator precedence</a>, allowed nested parentheses, and used superscripts to indicate <a href="Exponentiation" title="wikilink">exponents</a>. It was among the first programming systems to allow <a href="variable_(computer_science)" title="wikilink">symbolic variable</a> names and allocate storage automatically.</p>

<p>The system also automated the following tasks: <a href="floating_point" title="wikilink">floating point</a> computation, linkage to <a href="subroutine" title="wikilink">subroutines</a> for the basic functions of analysis (sine, etc.) and printing, and arrays and indexing.</p>

<p>The system accepted input on <a href="punched_tape" title="wikilink">punched tape</a> produced by a <a href="Friden_Flexowriter" title="wikilink">Friden Flexowriter</a>. The <a href="character_set" title="wikilink">character set</a> in use at the Whirlwind installation included "<a class="uri" href="upper-case" title="wikilink">upper-case</a>" (superscript) digits and a hyphen, which were used to indicate array indices, function codes, and (integer) exponents. Like other programming notations of its time, the system accepted only single-letter variable names and multiplication was indicated by juxtaposition of operands. A raised dot was available to indicate multiplication explicitly (the character was created by filing off the lower half of a colon!) The system also included support for solution of linear differential equations via the <a href="Runge-Kutta_methods" title="wikilink">Runge-Kutta method</a>.</p>

<p>The system was described in an 18-page typewritten manual written for people familiar with mathematics but perhaps unfamiliar with computers. It contains almost nothing in the way of an introduction to computer hardware.</p>

 in its subroutine library, but the example serves to give a flavor of the system's syntax. Note that division in the system is evaluated after multiplication:</p>

<p><code> 1 </code><em><code>x</code></em><code> = 0,</code><br/>
<code>   </code><em><code>z</code></em><code> = 1 - </code><em><code>x</code></em><sup><code>2</code></sup><code>/2 + </code><em><code>x</code></em><sup><code>4</code></sup><code>/2·3·4 - </code><em><code>x</code></em><sup><code>6</code></sup><code>/2·3·4·5·6</code><br/>

<code>   STOP</code></p>
<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>

<p>Few applications were written for the system. One documented application, authored by Laning and Zierler themselves, involved a problem in aeronautics. The problem required seven systems of differential equations to express, and had been given to the Whirlwind because it was too large for MIT's <a href="Differential_Analyzer" title="wikilink">Differential Analyzer</a> to handle. The authors, exploiting the Runge-Kutta feature of their programming system, produced a 97-statement program in two and half hours. The program ran successfully the first time.</p>
<h2 id="influence-on-fortran">Influence on FORTRAN</h2>

<p>Some sources have said that the Laning and Zierler system was the inspiration for <a class="uri" href="FORTRAN" title="wikilink">FORTRAN</a>. <a href="John_Backus" title="wikilink">John Backus</a> himself admitted to having contributed to this misconception:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The effect of the Laning and Zierler system on the development of FORTRAN is a question which has been muddled by many misstatements on my part. For many years I believed that we had gotten the idea for using algebraic notation in FORTRAN from seeing a demonstration of the Laning and Zierler system at MIT. (Backus )</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After reviewing documentation from the time, Backus learned that the FORTRAN project was "well underway" when he and his team got a chance to see Laning and Zierler's work:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>[W]e were already considering algebraic input considerably more sophisticated than that of Laning and Zierler's system when we first heard of their pioneering work... [I]t is difficult to know what, if any, new ideas we got from seeing the demonstration of their system. (Backus, <em>op cit</em>)</p>
